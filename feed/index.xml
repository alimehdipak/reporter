<p><i>The summer transfer window is here, and there&#8217;s plenty of gossip swirling about who&#8217;s moving where. Transfer Talk brings you all the latest buzz on rumours, comings, goings and, of course, done deals!</i></p>
<h2>LIVE TOP STORY: Gomez in Man City&#8217;s sights</h2>
<p>Manchester City are close to signing Anderlecht left-back Sergio Gomez, reveals Fabrizio Romano.</p>
<p>2 Related</p>
<p>City boss Pep Guardiola initially planned to loan the 21-year-old defender to LaLiga side Girona, who are part of the City Football Group, but he is considering keeping Gomez as part of the first-team squad at the Etihad Stadium.</p>
<p>The transfer fee is believed to be in excess of €10 million, with the discussions now at an advanced stage before he heads to Manchester for a medical. Gomez was a standout performer in the Belgian First Division last season, contributing to 17 goals in 39 appearances.</p>
<p>Man City have been on the lookout for a new left-sided defender after they parted ways with Oleksandr Zinchenko, who joined Arsenal for £32m in July. The Blues wanted Marc Cucurella, but they failed to meet Brighton &amp; Hove Albion&#8217;s asking price for the defender, who ended up joining Chelsea in a £63m move.</p>

<p>21.53 BST: Roma are looking to bring in a centre-back and are considering free agent Dan-Axel Zagadou, Tottenham Hotspur&#8217;s Japhet Tanganga as well as Manchester United duo Eric Bailly and Victor Lindelof, reports La Gazzette dello Sport.</p>
<p>It is also stated that Borussia Dortmund&#8217;s Manuel Akanji and Barcelona&#8217;s Samuel Umtiti could come into their thinking.</p>
<p>21.16 BST: Brentford have signed Denmark midfielder Mikkel Damsgaard on a five-year contract from Serie A side Sampdoria, both clubs said on Wednesday without disclosing the fee.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old joined the Genoa-based club two years ago, making 49 appearances and registering two goals and four assists in all competitions. He missed a large part of last season through injury.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mikkel is, in my opinion, another classic Brentford signing. He is a young player with big potential to develop further,&#8221; manager Thomas Frank said. Brentford host Manchester United on Saturday in their second Premier League match of the season after a 2-2 draw at Leicester City last week.</p>
<p>20.45 BST: As confirmed by the club&#8217;s official channels, Fulham have completed the signing of West Ham United centre-back Issa Diop. The Frenchman has signed for an undisclosed fee and signed a deal that will keep him with the Cottagers until 2027.</p>
<p>The 25-year-old played 26 games, scored one goal and made two assists for West Ham last season. &#8220;Issa(&#8216;s)&#8230; experience and formidable presence will be important to our squad in this Premier League season and for us to build a bright future in the years ahead,&#8221; Fulham co-owner Tony Khan said.</p>
<p>20.05 BST: Nottingham Forest have made an initial offer for Olympique Lyonnais midfielder Houssem Aouar, reports L&#8217;Equipe, with the Frenchman having been linked with various big-name clubs in recent transfer windows.</p>
<p>While Aouar would be open to a Premier League move, Forest&#8217;s offer is too far from Lyon&#8217;s demands with the clubs having received various offers while being yet to come to an agreement.</p>
<p>Aouar has made 215 appearances for Lyon, where he&#8217;s scored 40 goals and made 35 assists.</p>
<p>19.10 BST: Frenkie de Jong&#8217;s agents have arrived in Barcelona amid continued uncertainty over the midfielder&#8217;s future at the club, with Manchester United and Chelsea still pursuing his signing.</p>
<p>ESPN revealed in July that Barca had agreed a fee of around €85 million with United, including add-ons. However, the Dutchman has preferred to remain at Camp Nou.</p>
<p>Barca, meanwhile, have told De Jong that if he wants to stay he must take a salary cut, although sources have told ESPN he is reluctant to do so at this stage.</p>
<p>18.20 BST: As confirmed on the club&#8217;s official channels, Malang Sarr has joined AS Monaco on a season-long loan from Chelsea with the Ligue 1 outfit holding an option to make the deal permanent. This is their fourth summer signing following the incomings of Takumi Minamino, Breel Embolo and Thomas Didillon.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old defender joined Chelsea in 2020 on a free transfer from Nice and spent his first year on loan in Porto.</p>
<p>17.39 BST: While waiting for Giacomo Raspadori&#8217;s transfer to Napoli to be completed, Sassuolo are already moving to bring in Andrea Pinamonti from Internazionale, reports Sky Sports Italia. It has been agreed that the deal will be worth €20m, with Pinamonti now set to have a medical on Thursday morning before signing a contract.</p>
<p>16.43 BST: Manchester United have something of a history when it comes to making unexpected signings of veteran forwards, and they looked like resurrecting that transfer strategy this week with their interest in Marko Arnautovic.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, sources have told ESPN that Bologna&#8217;s asking price for his rights and a fan backlash against the deal scuppered the 33-year-old Austrian&#8217;s chances of joining the likes of Michael Owen, Henrik Larsson, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Edinson Cavani among United&#8217;s roll call of senior strikers.</p>
<p>The club&#8217;s curious approach for strapping centre-forward Arnautovic, who hasn&#8217;t played in the English top flight since 2019 when he left West Ham for Shanghai Port in China, does reveal the type of last-ditch signing they are seeking to make with the new season already underway.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the pool of long-forgotten (but, crucially, still active) Premier League strikers runs surprisingly deep, with many former stars still plying their trade around the world despite being well into their 30s &#8212; making them prime candidates to join United this month. Should coach Erik ten Hag be serious about bolstering his attacking stable with a journeyman forward of a certain age, then he has plenty of options.</p>
<p>&#8211; Sign Balotelli? Bring back Chicharito? Scouting for Man United&#8217;s next striker</p>
<p><img src="https://espnmediazone.com/us/files/2018/03/App-Icon-Android-7.png&amp;w=126&amp;site=espnfc" alt="" width="30" />16.04 BST: New signings Andreas Christensen and Franck Kessie could both leave Barcelona for free if they are not registered before Saturday&#8217;s LaLiga opener against Rayo Vallecano, various sources have confirmed to ESPN&#8217;s Sam Marsden and Moises Llorens.</p>
<p>Christensen and Kessie both joined Barca on free transfers earlier this summer from Chelsea and AC Milan respectively. With three days to go until the new campaign starts, however, neither has been registered with the Spanish league. Sources have told ESPN that if they are not registered prior to Barca&#8217;s opening fixture against Rayo, both players could choose to execute a clause that allows them to leave for free.</p>
<p>Fellow summer arrivals Robert Lewandowski, Raphinha and Jules Kounde are also yet to be inscribed with LaLiga, while the contract renewals signed by Sergi Roberto and Ousmane Dembele have not been registered either.</p>
<p>ESPN understands Christensen and Kessie&#8217;s situations are slightly different, though, given they joined Barca for free. Therefore, if they so choose, they would be entitled to leave for free before the transfer window closes.</p>
<p>Sources say at this stage there is no indication it will come to that and president Joan Laporta continues to transmit optimism that all seven players will be registered in time, but Barca are cutting it fine before the start of the season. In the worst case scenario, sources told ESPN Barcelona would seek to speak with the players&#8217; agents to avoid such an extreme outcome because they have until the end of the month to register signings.</p>
<p>&#8211; Marsden: Why can&#8217;t Barca register summer signings yet? Explaining the situation</p>
<p>15.29 BST: Manchester United players have become frustrated by the saga around Cristiano Ronaldo&#8217;s future, according to The Sun.</p>
<p>Ronaldo submitted a transfer request to leave Old Trafford earlier this summer. The 37-year-old did not take part in United&#8217;s preseason tour of Thailand and Australia because of personal reasons and he started their 2-1 defeat to Brighton on the bench.</p>
<p>Other United players are said to be angry at Ronaldo&#8217;s behaviour and want the situation resolved as quickly as possible. There appear to be few options for the Portugal forward, with Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich and Chelsea having distanced themselves from his signing.</p>
<p><img src="https://espnmediazone.com/us/files/2018/03/App-Icon-Android-7.png&amp;w=126&amp;site=espnfc" alt="" width="30" />14.56 BST: Bernardo Silva has told ESPN he is happy at Manchester City but admitted his future remains up in the air with just three weeks to go before the end of the transfer window.</p>
<p>Silva has been linked with a move to Barcelona despite the Spanish side&#8217;s difficulties in registering their summer signings who have already arrived at Camp Nou.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, City rubbished reports they have agreed a £67.5m fee with Barcelona for Silva, but, speaking to ESPN, the Portugal midfielder left the door open for a move before the window closes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always said that I&#8217;m happy here but I have no idea what&#8217;s going to happen,&#8221; Silva, who was a substitute in City&#8217;s 2-0 win against West Ham United on the opening weekend of the Premier League season on Sunday, said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see, honestly. My relationship with the club is very honest. I&#8217;ve been open with them and they know what I want. If I stay, I&#8217;m very happy and I will always respect this club and give all my best.</p>
<p>&#8220;If not, it&#8217;s football and we&#8217;ll just see what happens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Bernardo Silva talks to ESPN about his future, City deserving more respect, World Cup hopes</p>
<p><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/espn/misc_logos/500-dark/transfers.png" alt="" width="30" />14.35 BST: Marseille have signed Alexis Sanchez on a free transfer from Inter Milan, the French club announced on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Inter had released a statement saying his contract was ended on Monday and Marseille said at the time that they had an agreement in principle to sign him.</p>
<p>Sanchez, 33, joined Inter from Manchester United in 2019 and made 109 appearances in all competitions, scoring 20 goals.</p>
<p>However, he didn&#8217;t feature much in the last season and the club said that the two parties had come to a mutual agreement to end his contract.</p>
<p><img src="https://espnmediazone.com/us/files/2018/03/App-Icon-Android-7.png&amp;w=126&amp;site=espnfc" alt="" width="30" />14.19 BST: Manchester United have registered their interest in PSV Eindhoven winger Cody Gakpo, sources have told ESPN&#8217;s rob Dawson.</p>
<p>Gakpo&#8217;s representatives have been alerted to United&#8217;s interest by recruitment staff at Old Trafford but the club have yet to submit a bid.</p>
<p>Gakpo is valued at around £35 million by PSV, who are managed by former United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, and sources have told ESPN they are unlikely to accept anything less for one of their star players.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old came through the club&#8217;s academy and scored 21 goals in 47 games last season. He has been capped seven times by the Netherlands, scoring twice.</p>
<p>Sources added there is interest from other Premier League clubs in Gakpo, who scored twice in PSV&#8217;s 4-1 opening-day win against FC Emmen on Saturday, but that he would be keen to move to United if terms are agreed.</p>
<p>&#8211; Gakpo, Saliba, Elliott: Who could be Europe&#8217;s next breakout star?</p>
<p><img src="https://espnmediazone.com/us/files/2018/03/App-Icon-Android-7.png&amp;w=126&amp;site=espnfc" alt="" width="30" />13.45 BST: Karim Benzema has hinted in an interview with ESPN that Real Madrid do not need to sign another striker as the Spanish champions have several players who can fill the role.</p>
<p>Benzema, 34, enjoyed a fine season last campaign as Madrid lifted LaLiga, the Champions League and the Spanish Supercup, scoring 44 goals in 46 appearances in all competitions.</p>
<p>Carlo Ancelotti&#8217;s side have signed midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni from Monaco and centre-back Antonio Rudiger from Chelsea this summer, but they have yet to strengthen in attack having missed out on the signing of Paris Saint-Germain&#8217;s Kylian Mbappe.</p>
<p>They have also lost strikers Luka Jovic and Borja Mayoral to Fiorentina and Getafe respectively, but Benzema suggested another forward was not necessary given other options in the squad.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are lots of players who can play as a No. 9 because [a] Madrid [striker] isn&#8217;t a typical No. 9 who&#8230; waits for balls, you have to move everywhere,&#8221; Benzema said before Madrid&#8217;s UEFA Supercup clash against Eintracht Frankfurt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like the manager also said, there are lots of players. Afterwards in terms of signing another one [No. 9], you have to ask him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Hunter: Madrid cruise into new season as rivals play catch-up</p>
<p>13.06 BST: Tottenham Hotspur are closing in on a deal worth around £21m for Udinese defender Destiny Udogie, sources have told ESPN&#8217;s James Olley.</p>
<p>Spurs will loan the left-back back to the Serie A club for this season before he joins up with his new team in the summer of 2023.</p>
<p>Sources have told ESPN that Tottenham will pay an initial £15m with a series of performance related add-ons worth in the region of £6m.</p>
<p>A medical is expected to take place in Italy this week.</p>
<p>12.29 BST: Espanyol have not received any offers for their coveted striker Raul de Tomas amid reports Sevilla want to sign the Spain international.</p>
<p>De Tomas, 27, is under contract with Espanyol until June 2026 and has been a reported target of Real Madrid and Barcelona in recent months.</p>
<p>Sevilla are looking to strengthen their attack and are willing to offer €20m and include Moroccan forward Munir El Haddadi in the deal to bring De Tomas to the Sanchez Pizjuan stadium, while Premier League club Aston Villa have also been linked.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are no offers for Raul de Tomas,&#8221; Espanyol sporting direcgor Domingo Catoira said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what could happen in the coming days.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can see anxiety in many clubs so we will see what happens. I see Raul as part of us because he is.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Tomas was one of the leading scorers in LaLiga last season with 17 goals. The Real Madrid youth product joined Espanyol in 2020 from Benfica for a reported €22m.</p>
<p><img src="https://espnmediazone.com/us/files/2018/03/App-Icon-Android-7.png&amp;w=126&amp;site=espnfc" alt="" width="30" />11.41 BST: Manchester United have been offered the chance to sign former Chelsea striker Alvaro Morata, sources have told ESPN&#8217;s Rob Dawson.</p>
<p>The 29-year-old has a year left on his contract at Atletico Madrid and has spent the last two seasons on loan at Juventus.</p>
<p>The club were in talks with Bologna about a deal for former Stoke City and West Ham United striker Marko Arnautovic but sources have told ESPN the Italian side&#8217;s demands scuppered any hope of an agreement.</p>
<p>After withdrawing their interest in Arnautovic, United remain in the hunt for a striker who would be happy with a place on the bench to offer a different option to Cristiano Ronaldo and Anthony Martial.</p>
<p>Martial is injured and Ronaldo is not yet match-fit after missing most of preseason because of a family issue, forcing Ten Hag to start with Christian Eriksen as a false No.9 for the opening-day defeat to Brighton.</p>
<p>11.05 BST: Serbian winger Filip Kostic is expected to undergo a medical with Juventus on Wednesday ahead of his €17m transfer, add-ons included, from Eintracht Frankfurt, Tuttosport reports.</p>
<p>Kostic, 29, was left out of Eintracht&#8217;s squad for Wednesday&#8217;s European Supercup against Real Madrid with the Bundesliga side confirming the player&#8217;s imminent departure.</p>
<p>Kostic, who scored 33 goals and set up 64 more in 171 games for Eintracht, is set to sign a three-year deal with Juve.</p>
<p>Juve have signed this summer free agents Paul Pogba and Angel Di Maria as well as Gleison Bremer from Torino.</p>
<p>10.32 BST: Villarreal expect to receive a big offer from the Premier League for teenage winger Yeremy Pino, according to El Periodico.</p>
<p>Pino is one of LaLiga&#8217;s most promising players and is under contract with the Yellow Submarine until June 2027. Last season&#8217;s Champions League semifinalists are prepared to let Pino leave this summer if the right bid comes along.</p>
<p>Arsenal and Liverpool have reportedly shown an interest in the 19-year-old, but no offer has been made so far. Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta is an admirer of the Spain international and reportedly requested his signing in the previous transfer window.</p>
<p>Pino has an €80m release clause and Villarreal would only be willing to let him go for a minimum fee of €45m.</p>
<p>09.59 BST: Fiorentina have rekindled their interest in signing Tottenham midfielder Giovani Lo Celso, according to Sky Sports.</p>
<p>The Argentina international spent the second half of last season on loan at Villarreal from Tottenham and impressed.</p>
<p>Lo Celso, 26, has reportedly agreed terms to join Villarreal this summer but the Spanish club has not been able to finalise the deal because of LaLiga&#8217;s financial fair play rules.</p>
<p>Fiorentina have now entered the race to sign long-term target Lo Celso, and are willing to pay €2m to sign Lo Celso on a season-long loan and include a €20m buy option.</p>
<p><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/espn/misc_logos/500-dark/transfers.png" alt="" width="30" />09.27 BST: England international and Euro 2022 winner Rachel Daly has signed for Aston Villa from the Houston Dash for an undisclosed fee.</p>
<p>Daly started all six games for England in this summer&#8217;s European Championship, including the final when the Lionesses beat Germany after extra time to win their first ever major trophy. While Daly operated at left-back for England, Villa signaled they they plan to utilise her further forward when the Women&#8217;s Super League gets underway next month.</p>
<p>Daly, who previously had spells in England with Leeds United, Lincoln Ladies and West Ham United, was drafted No. 6 overall in the 2016 National Women&#8217;s Soccer League college draft. The 30-year-old made 116 appearances for Houston in all competitions, scoring 42 goals and adding 12 assists, helping the team to win the 2020 NWSL Challenge Cup.</p>
<p>&#8211; &#8216;We&#8217;re going to Disneyland!&#8217; Lionesses off to Paris</p>
<p><img src="https://espnmediazone.com/us/files/2018/03/App-Icon-Android-7.png&amp;w=126&amp;site=espnfc" alt="" width="30" /> 08.43 BST: Former Arsenal winger Willian is considering an offer to join Fulham just one year after returning to his native Brazil, ESPN Brasil has confirmed.</p>
<p>Willian, 34, re-joined Brazilian side Corinthians last summer after eight seasons playing in the Premier League. The former Chelsea and Arsenal player has struggled to make an impact at Corinthians and could leave the Sao Paulo club in the coming days as talks with Fulham intensify.</p>
<p>Willian started Corinthians&#8217; 1-0 defeat against Flamengo in the Copa Libertadores quarterfinals on Tuesday, and with the club knocked out the chances of Willian leaving have now increased.</p>
<p>Under contract with Corinthians until December 2023, Willian is keen to return to London for safety reasons. The player and his family have reportedly receiving persistent threats on social media from furious Corinthians fans every time the team loses.</p>
<p>08.00 BST: Man City have denied reports that they have agreed a transfer fee with Barcelona for Bernardo Silva, reports the Daily Mail.</p>
<p>It had been suggested that City had accepted £46m for the Portugal international to head to Camp Nou.</p>
<p>Silva, 28, has a transfer value closer to £80m, so City will not allow the midfielder to leave for little more than half that amount.</p>
<p>However, last week coach Pep Guardiola hinted that Silva might not be at City after the transfer window closes on Sept. 1.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I want Bernardo to be here but I don&#8217;t know what is going to happen, honestly I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Guardiola said. &#8220;What will happen will happen and if in the end he has to leave it&#8217;s because football is like this and I won&#8217;t be a person to stop the desires of the people. When you are a football player it is so short.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barcelona already face a race against time to be able to register all of their new signings for the start of LaLiga next weekend, sources have told ESPN. LaLiga informed Barca this week they will need to pull a fourth financial lever if they want to have everyone available to face Rayo Vallecano at Camp Nou on Aug. 13.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>PAPER GOSSIP</h2>
<p>&#8211; Memphis Depay looks to be edging closer to an exit from Barcelona, with Juventus discussing a two-year contract for the 28-year-old forward, writes Fabrizio Romano. While he scored 12 goals in LaLiga last season, Depay is one of the players that the <i>Blaugrana </i>are aiming to offload this summer. It is reported that Tottenham Hotspur have no interest in his services, despite previous links suggesting that a move to north London was possible.</p>
<p>&#8211; Sergio Busquets has accepted a new deal that will see his wages restructured, reports Marca. With Barcelona looking to find resolutions in their race to register their new signings, the 34-year-old midfielder is the latest veteran to agree to a new contract that will assist the <i>Blaugrana </i>with their financial difficulties. It is understood that while his salary will remain the same, Busquets will see his payments deferred as well as receiving instalments over the course of the season.</p>
<p>&#8211; Eintracht Frankfurt have identified Eric Ebimbe as a replacement for Filip Kostic, reveals Foot Mercato. With Juventus closing in on a move for Kostic, the Bundesliga side have moved fast to ensure that they don&#8217;t struggle to find an alternative before the transfer window closes. A transfer fee of around €10m is understood to have been agreed between <i>Die Adler</i> and Paris Saint-Germain, with the 21-year-old winger set to sign a five-year deal.</p>
<p>&#8211; Giovanni Simeone shone in Serie A last season and caught the attention of Napoli, who are now understood to be closing in on a deal for his services. That&#8217;s according to Gianluca Di Marzio, who writes that the 27-year-old striker will join on loan for €3.5m, with the deal including an option to make the move permanent for a fee of €12m. While starring for Hellas Verona last season, Simeone scored 17 goals in 35 appearances.</p>
<p>&#8211; Barcelona midfielder Nico Gonzalez is close to securing a loan move to Valencia, reports Mundo Deportivo. The 20-year-old will sign a new contract at Camp Nou through to 2024 before sealing a short-term move to <i>Los Che</i>. Gonzalez made 27 appearances in LaLiga last season.</p>

<p>This cosmetics guru has <em>made up</em> her mind regarding how often one should clean their brushes.</p>
<p>A makeup professional, who posts on TikTok under the name @AskEllenBeauty, revealed the top five things she would never do as a beauty expert.</p>
<p>In a viral video with more than 2.1 million views, the Aussie said using makeup brushes too often without properly cleansing them can cause infection.</p>
<p>“I would never use my personal brush more than once before sanitizing it,” she said in her clip while putting on eyeshadow. “I once had a client who got a staph infection from using a dirty sponge — like her own dirty sponge obviously.”</p>
<p>While she suggested to “regularly sanitize and change” brushes, another tip was to never buy a limited-edition or holiday eyeshadow palette without testing it with swatches first.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/makeup-artist-brushes-06.jpg?w=577" alt="makeup" width="577" height="1024" />The Australian shared five things she “would never do” as a makeup artist.@askellenbeauty</p>
<p>“The items don’t have an economy of scale, so brands sometimes use a cheaper pigment in those items to save money,” Ellen explained. “That means even with a brand you know and like, the holiday palette is often chalky and not very good.”</p>
<p>She also suggested letting foundations dry before buying in order to ensure they’re a proper match.</p>
<p>Testing mascaras in beauty stores is also a big no-no. “Eye infections are just not worth it,” she said.</p>
<p>In a follow-up video, the makeup artist showed viewers how to properly wash the brushes using a small squeeze bottle of quick-drying spray by squirting a few spritzes on a cotton pad.</p>
<p>She then took her dirty brushes and scrubbed them vigorously until the gunky makeup wiped off, noting the whole cleaning process takes a mere 30 seconds to perfect thanks to Cinema Secrets’ makeup brush cleanser.</p>
<p>“No excuses,” she said.</p>
<p>A United Kingdom study published earlier this year revealed that makeup brushes can actually be dirtier than a toilet, with microscopic photos showing the brushes full of mold, bacteria, yeast and other nightmarish microbes.</p>

<p>“It’s awful to see the amount of bacteria that could potentially sit on a makeup brush,” Dr. Suhail Alam, medical director at the Aventus Clinic, which conducted the research, told Jam Press in April.</p>
<p>“Even after a person uses a makeup brush for the first time, it will already be forming colonies of bacteria,” Alam said. “With daily use, the brushes will automatically start collecting dirt, pollutants, oil and dead skin cells, which is why makeup brushes act as a breeding ground for bacteria which can lead to breakouts and skin irritations.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/tommy-lee-nude-005a.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024" alt="Mötley Crüe’s Tommy Lee posts full-frontal nude photo: ‘Ooooopppsss’" /></p>
<p>Oops… Tommy Lee did it again.</p>
<p>The Mötley Crüe drummer, 59, posted a full-frontal nude photo on Instagram showing almost all of his manhood, but then deleted the NSFW snap.</p>
<p>“Ooooopppsss,” the musician captioned the snapshot posted in the wee hours of Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Before the naked image was deleted, 1.4 million followers, fans and friends collectively gasped at his nude pic.</p>
<p>“OH MY GOD,” his wife, Brittany Furlan commented.</p>
<p>Influencer Daniel Mac joked: “How long will this stay up?”</p>
<p>Instagram has a firm no-nudity rule and it wasn’t long before Lee’s post was taken down. Of course, the image has since made its way to Twitter, though.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/tommy-lee-nude-005a.jpg?w=1024" alt="Tommy Lee" width="1024" height="682" />The rock drummer was a little too open with fans with his nude photo on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“Well I didn’t expect this when I opened Instagram,” one fan joked.</p>
<p>“Please put the phone down,” another pleaded.</p>
<p>“Your drumstick fell out,” a user joked. The LGBTQ dating app Grindr wrote: “Wrong app, babe.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/tommy-lee-nude-004.jpg?w=768" alt="Tommy Lee full frontal nudity" width="618" height="823" />“Ooooopppsss,” the musician captioned his NSFW pic. Twitter/mrtommyland</p>
<p>Lee has showed off his genitalia several times before, including in his 1995 sex tape with ex-wife Pamela Anderson and in 2019, when he simply posted a video of Furlan, 35, holding it up.</p>
<p>“These new Instagram filters are finally gettin wood … I mean GD!!!!!! they finally gave me my own filter,” he jokingly captioned the clip at the time.</p>
<p>Hulu’s 2022 drama miniseries “Pam &amp; Tommy” dramatized the couple’s sex tape and how it was stolen in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Lily James transformed into Anderson, 55, and Sebastian Stan made a complete 180 to portray Lee for the series. Seth Rogen, Taylor Schilling and Nick Offerman also starred in the Emmy-nominated show.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/tommy-lee-nude-006.jpg?w=1024" alt="Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee " width="1024" height="757" />Anderson and Lee were married from 1995 until 1998.WireImage</p>
<p>In one shocking scene in the eight-episode series, Stan portraying Lee has a conversation with his penis. The Marvel actor, 39, was actually talking to an animatronic penis prosthetic, confessing that he’s in love with the “Baywatch” star.</p>
<p>The talking member is voiced by comedian Jason Mantzoukas, and the scene in question was actually inspired by an anecdote in Lee’s 2005 memoir, “Tommyland.”</p>
<p>Director Craig Gillespie explained how difficult it was to shoot that scene in an interview with Variety this past January, describing it as “just awkward.”</p>
<p>“You’ve got four puppeteers working with an animatronic penis,” he said. “And then, how much is too much, and do you start to lose his emotional torment of what’s going on? Hopefully it works.”</p>

<p>Every top club has exciting young talent ready to make the step up and get on the transfer radar of Europe&#8217;s elite sides.</p>
<p>2 Related</p>
<p>As the 2022-23 campaign kicks off around the continent, our resident scout looks at the next group of players who could follow the path of Aurelien Tchouameni, who went from Monaco&#8217;s midfield to being at the centre of Manchester City, Real Madrid and Liverpool&#8217;s €80 million tussle for his signature this summer (eventually won by Madrid).</p>
<p>Who could the next breakout star be from Europe&#8217;s top leagues?</p>
<p><img height="250px" src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2022/0804/r1044319_864x1296_2-3.jpg" /></p>
<p>Age: 17<br />Position: Striker<br />Club: Borussia Dortmund<br />Country: Germany</p>
<p>From his preferred position as a floating central striker, Moukoko tends to want passes played behind the defensive line, or into his feet in front of the centre-backs; partly because he&#8217;s hard to catch with space to exploit, but also because his turn of pace and balance often put markers on the defensive.</p>
<p>His precise left foot, fine awareness in the penalty area and exceptional finishing set the Germany under-21 international apart at youth level, but he has struggled at first-team level. However, he has exhibited flashes of technical finesse, trickery and a burst of pace as a reminder that he can become a world-class talent. And with better decision-making and a bit more incisiveness in the last third, the teen will surely be attracting attention again as his contract expires in 2023.</p>
<p><img height="250px" src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2022/0530/r1019551_864x1296_2-3.jpg" /></p>
<p>Age: 23<br />Position: Forward / Striker<br />Club: AC Milan<br />Country: Portugal</p>
<p>The 23-year-old had already caught the eye of plenty of scouts over the years, but his superb season in AC Milan&#8217;s <i>Scudetto-</i>winning campaign &#8212; 14 goals and 12 assists in 42 games &#8212; suggests he&#8217;s on the brink of something big. Having previously shown flashes of physical and technical ability, Leao last season added finesse, tactical awareness and end product.</p>
<p>From his preferred role on the left wing &#8212; and the occasional cameo as a centre-forward &#8212; the Portugal international proved a threat with his incisive and direct runs causing opposing defenders plenty of trouble. His ability to take on a defence on his own saw Milan benefit from some crucial goals and fine attacking combinations, and his three assists in the title-deciding 3-0 win at Sassuolo in late May all came from exploiting space in wide areas. If Leao can build on his recent improvement, Milan could face a real struggle to keep hold of their game-changing forward.</p>
<p><img height="250px" src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2022/0804/r1044323_864x1296_2-3.jpg" /></p>
<p>Age: 19<br />Position: Striker<br />Club: FC Salzburg<br />Country: Slovenia</p>
<p>Salzburg have an outstanding record in nurturing young attacking talent &#8212; Erling Haaland, Sadio Mane and Karim Adeyemi to name a few &#8212; so there&#8217;s every reason to get excited about the 6-foot-4 Sesko, who bagged 10 goals and seven assists in 36 games last season for the Austrian champions.</p>
<p>Though the early (inevitable) comparisons to Haaland are wide of the mark &#8212; the Man City star offers more directness, mobility and aggression in his play &#8212; Sesko is also quick for a tall centre-forward and has repeatedly shown an impressive, effortless technique when finishing chances on the ground. The Slovenia international also enjoys roaming in attacking areas, has good acceleration and often picks up smart positions in wide areas to start his runs into the box. When in more central areas, he has the movement and mental sharpness to get away from his marker and pick the right spaces to get on the end of crosses.</p>
<p>Despite his sturdy frame, Sesko has yet to take full advantage of his physical attributes &#8212; at times appearing somewhat easy to nudge off balance or dispossess &#8212; and he has room for aerial improvement, as well as better close control. However, he&#8217;s quickly becoming a target for big European clubs, with RB Leipzig announcing an agreement to sign him on a five-year contract as of July 1, 2023.</p>
<p><img height="250px" src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2022/0804/r1044305_864x1296_2-3.jpg" /></p>
<p>Age: 21<br />Position: Forward<br />Club: Napoli<br />Country: Georgia</p>
<p>Replacing Lorenzo Insigne and Dries Mertens is a tall order for any forward player, but Napoli&#8217;s €12m arrival shares some attributes with the two recently departed club legends and is part winger, part playmaker.</p>
<p>Hailed as Georgia&#8217;s biggest talent in at least a decade, Kvaratskhelia will hope he can build on the work of Man City&#8217;s Georgi Kinkladze and Milan&#8217;s Kakha Kaladze to raise the profile of football in his homeland. The 21-year-old predominantly played his football in Russia before a cameo for Dinamo Batumi in Georgia earlier this year, but he has developed a lot over the past 18 months.</p>
<p>During his country&#8217;s impressive UEFA Nations League campaign (topping Group C4), the right-footed winger has stood out as a difference-maker, a leader and a source of relentless energy. At his best when cutting in from the left, Kvaratskhelia is in his element in the final third, either taking aim with an early shot or setting up rapid combinations or one-twos, and is always looking to progress the ball.</p>
<p>While he has averaged more than 12 dribbles per game for his national side this year, Kvaratskhelia is also hardworking and determined; he tracks back and takes care of his defensive duties, which is not always the case for players with such natural flair.</p>
<p><img height="250px" src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2022/0804/r1044310_864x1296_2-3.jpg" /></p>
<p>Age: 19<br />Position: Forward<br />Club: FC Porto<br />Country: Brazil</p>
<p>Yet to show sustained consistency at the first-team level, Veron joined FC Porto from Palmeiras for €10.5m earlier in this transfer window. The winger has been considered one of Brazil&#8217;s top prospects for several years and ran away with the Golden Ball at the under-17 World Cup in 2019 to begin down the road to stardom, but a lot is now expected of him at Porto given their stunning record in developing South American talent.</p>
<p>In addition to being a fountain of unpredictable creativity in the final third, Veron&#8217;s direct running, electric pace and willingness to break through the defensive line make him a tough opponent to face. He usually operates with some freedom to roam inward to the central areas, then uses his instinctive problem-solving ability and mesmerising ball control at speed to get into the box. Veron requires few touches to provide key passes or finishes and has wonderful technique, which should see him impress immediately in Portugal before potentially moving on to a bigger club.</p>
<p><img height="250px" src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2022/0206/r970787_864x1296_2-3.jpg" /></p>
<p>Age: 19<br />Position: Attacking midfielder / Forward<br />Club: Liverpool<br />Country: England</p>
<p>After last season was compromised by a serious ankle injury, Elliott appears set for his proper Premier League breakthrough. On early evidence, he looked fresh as he came on for Liverpool in their 2-2 draw at former club Fulham, feeding Mohamed Salah with a clever pass that could have ended in a goal and generally participating well defensively via his relentless pressing game.</p>
<p>Though the teenager was originally an inverted winger, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp seems to prefer him in a more central position, which is understandable given Elliott&#8217;s skill set. Whether deployed wide or centrally &#8212; and despite not having electric pace &#8212; the Fulham academy graduate is an excellent ball carrier, often dropping deep to create a passing option before progressing forward. When he sets off he&#8217;s hard to dispossess and at times his runs culminate in a key pass or a delivery into the box.</p>
<p>While his ability to create havoc cutting in from the right onto his favoured left foot might be the most recognised aspect of his game, he&#8217;s also equipped with patience (not common for teenagers) and doesn&#8217;t always select the most immediate decision or release the ball to the most obvious teammate around him. One of the most promising talents of his generation, Elliott is rapidly becoming an exciting, complete attacking midfielder who could go on to big things.</p>
<p><img height="250px" src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2022/0517/r1014085_864x1296_2-3.jpg" /></p>
<p>Age: 21<br />Position: Forward<br />Club: Nottingham Forest<br />Country: England</p>
<p>He may have only had one impactful season in the Championship &#8212; 16 goals and nine assists in 46 games last season; plus two goals in three games during the playoffs on the way to promotion &#8212; but there&#8217;s plenty to the Wales international that suggests that he could build on his recent form.</p>
<p>Mostly deployed on the right side of attack, Johnson&#8217;s versatility means he can play anywhere across the frontline, and he found great success in the transitional phase last season. Often lurking around the halfway line, Johnson was able to use his speed over a longer distance to outrun full-backs and free himself from markers with clever turns while closely controlling the ball.</p>
<p>Courtesy of smart off-the-ball movement, Johnson is skilled at reading the development of the play and, using his direct running, can time his runs to perfection to get on the end of a pass. The 21-year-old&#8217;s opportunity to make a mark for Forest this season will come on the break, but he may need to learn how to become more effective against a settled defence too if he moves to a bigger club.</p>
<p><img height="250px" src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2022/0804/r1044312_864x1296_2-3.jpg" /></p>
<p>Age: 21<br />Position: Centre-back<br />Club: Arsenal<br />Country: France</p>
<p>In such a magnificent generation of France centre-backs, few would have backed Saliba to be the one to muscle his way into the starting XI for <i>Les Bleus </i>and stay there. However, judging by his excellent loan season at Marseille and highly promising senior debut for Arsenal against Crystal Palace, it looks likely that the 21-year-old will continue to impress.</p>
<p>Three years on from his €30m move to the Emirates and without a competitive game for the club to his name, he was very nearly written off. However, he returns from Marseille as a polished central defender with a well-balanced skill set. Saliba&#8217;s pass completion rate of 94% last season &#8212; of which 4.5 per game were progressive (forward) &#8212; places him among the top &#8220;ball-playing centre-backs&#8221; in European football and it speaks volumes about a defender who was often on the receiving end of criticism for being timid and short of confidence on the pitch.</p>
<p>While he is also a resolute, assertive tackler, there are improvements needed in Saliba&#8217;s aerial game. That said, having undergone such exceptional development over the past year, it seems his proper breakthrough is imminent and he may soon be considered an elite Premier League centre-back.</p>
<p><img height="250px" src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2022/0804/r1044314_864x1296_2-3.jpg" /></p>
<p>Age: 21<br />Position: Central midfield<br />Club: Benfica<br />Country: Argentina</p>
<p>The deep-lying playmaker arrived at Benfica with a high reputation after two fine seasons with River Plate. Though new to European football, Fernandez should face few issues in adapting quickly to a new football culture. Playing with tenacity and determination, the young midfielder already possesses some of the crucial mental attributes he will need to impress. Last week he stood out in his competitive debut for Benfica, capping a fine performance with a breathtaking volley from a corner, lashed into the net from outside the box. Indeed, the goal provided a snapshot of one of his key skills: hitting the ball well from distance with first-class coordination and power.</p>
<p>Normally positioned as one of two deep midfielders, Fernandez enjoys licence to venture forward &#8212; which can see him succeed in something akin to a No. 8 role &#8212; and takes up positions able to capitalise on a loose ball at the edge of the area. Earlier in his team&#8217;s build-up, the Argentine is capable of dictating the flow of the game, picking up the right positions, and excels with smooth, well-paced passes. Perhaps even more impressive for a player of his age, Fernandez is positive in his passing &#8212; always looking to feed his teammates with a ball through the defensive line and spotting runs out wide.</p>
<p>Benfica managed to bring him to the club for around €12m this summer and are one of the top European teams in terms of moving players on for a profit; Fernandez could be next on the agenda if he has a good year.</p>
<p><img height="250px" src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2022/0804/r1044317_864x1296_2-3.jpg" /></p>
<p>Age: 23<br />Position: Forward<br />Club: PSV Eindhoven<br />Country: Netherlands</p>
<p>One of the outstanding attackers in Europe last season &#8212; with 21 goals, 15 assists in 46 games for PSV across all competitions &#8212; Gakpo has shown his quality at Eredivisie and international level, and now finds himself firmly on the radar of some of the biggest clubs in the world.</p>
<p>The dynamic winger averages six dribbles per game, has a rapid turn of pace, impressive ball progression and can make sharp diagonal runs from wide into dangerous areas. He is also more than active in the defensive side of the game and works to regain the ball when out of possession (1.9 ball recoveries and 17 challenges on average last season).</p>
<p>When on the ball, Gakpo balances team orders with refreshing creativity and often shows off some lovely touches to deceive an opponent. He has a powerful shot &#8212; often by cutting in from the left on his right foot &#8212; and can strike a set piece, too. If he continues on this trajectory, he won&#8217;t be in the Eredivisie for much longer.</p>
<p><img height="250px" src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2022/0804/r1044301_864x1296_2-3.jpg" /></p>
<p>Age: 21<br />Position: Attacking midfield / Forward<br />Club: AC Milan<br />Country: Belgium</p>
<p>A €35m move to the Serie A champions this summer came after a title-winning breakthrough season with Club Brugge, but De Ketelaere&#8217;s ceiling suggests he isn&#8217;t finished improving yet.</p>
<p>In addition to his excellent close control and fine decision-making in the last third &#8212; he&#8217;s particularly smart at taking up advantageous positions in and around the penalty area &#8212; it&#8217;s his physical profile and versatility that sets him apart from others. At 6-foot-4, De Ketelaere is hardly the typical &#8220;floating&#8221; attacking player, his build more resembles a centre-forward, but with first-class command of his body, he excels in one-vs.-one situations and usually advances with the ball despite being marked or stuck in a tight spot.</p>
<p>Where Milan boss Stefano Pioli intends to use the Belgium international &#8212; who can drop deeper to take part in the build-up play and generally prefers to cut in from the left &#8212; is still an open question, but he offers a plethora of options. De Ketelaere&#8217;s work-rate and pressing game (he averaged nearly 23 pressures per game last season), along with his creativity and positive passing, means he should be a good fit for the competitive nature of Serie A.</p>
<p><img height="250px" src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2022/0422/r1002909_864x1296_2-3.jpg" /></p>
<p>Age: 21<br />Position: Centre-back, right-back<br />Club: Ajax<br />Country: Netherlands</p>
<p>With an exodus of players leaving the Dutch champions this summer (Lisandro Martinez, Sebastien Haller, Ryan Gravenberch and Andre Onana among them), it&#8217;s surprising that their No. 1 defender has remained in the Eredivisie. Perfectly suited for the modern game, Timber&#8217;s main strengths are found in his ability to master a high defensive line. Courtesy of fine anticipation &#8212; not always a given for young centre-backs &#8212; Timber repeatedly wins the ball early (though his 66.9% duel success rate is impressive regardless of the area of the pitch), often in the opponents&#8217; half, without giving away an excessive amount of fouls.</p>
<p>His mobility, pace and knack of reading what his opponent is going to do also ensures he can recover the ball in the event of a mistimed intervention or a poor pass. Perhaps less talked about is Timber&#8217;s versatility, which could also see him used as a right-back or as a ball-carrying right-sided centre-back in a back three.</p>
<p>On the flipside &#8212; as often pointed out among scouts &#8212; his aerial game still leaves something to be desired (especially on defensive set-pieces), but there are signs of improvement, and last season he won 5% more aerial duels than the year before. Though priced out of the market in this transfer window, expect elite European clubs to keep sniffing around him in the future.</p>
<p><img height="250px" src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2022/0421/r1002791_864x1296_2-3.jpg" /></p>
<p>Age: 20<br />Position: Forward<br />Club: Rennes<br />Country: France</p>
<p>Due to repeated injuries, the talented Belgium international hardly got going for Rennes last season. However, when 100% fit, there are few top-level players who can offer as much directness, pace and relentless dribbling as Doku. Whether deployed on his preferred right side, or the left of the midfield, the winger can take on his full-back by going either direction &#8212; either through quick body feints, changes of lane, or simply knocking the ball past his opponent and winning the race.</p>
<p>As with most players with a similar profile, Doku becomes more effective after his team have regained possession and his ball-carrying skills and eagerness to run in behind defenders can come into force. He is a gamechanger, and even when he&#8217;s been quiet, he can pop up to decide things. Having been identified early by a number of top European clubs while playing for Belgium&#8217;s youth sides, there&#8217;s little to suggest that he will drop off their radars any time soon.</p>
<p><img height="250px" src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2022/0804/r1044303_864x1296_2-3.jpg" /></p>
<p>Age: 18<br />Position: Central midfield<br />Club: Chelsea<br />Country: England</p>
<p>The standout performer in England&#8217;s European Under-19 Championship-winning side, becoming a hit among travelling scouts from across Europe during the finals in Slovakia this summer. They raved over the midfielder as his stamina, combined with wonderful ball-progression and high technical skills, make him almost the ideal midfield No. 8.</p>
<p>After making 11 Premier League appearances for Aston Villa last season, he moved to Chelsea for around £15m following a dispute over a new contract, and it&#8217;s easy to see why he has such a sky-high reputation. He operates with a decisiveness and authority which is rare for an 18-year-old; through his willingness to get into the box there&#8217;s end product too, plus he&#8217;s a fine finisher and a growing aerial presence.</p>
<p>As one senior European scout told me during the tournament: &#8220;If you were to design the perfect box-to-box midfielder, Chukwuemeka would be the prototype. He&#8217;s dynamic &#8212; a great athlete &#8212; effortless on the ball, breaks lines, he makes everything look easy. He plays with high self-esteem, takes responsibility, attacks and defends. What more can you ask for?&#8221;</p>
<p><img height="250px" src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2022/0421/r1002800_864x1296_2-3.jpg" /></p>
<p>Age: 20<br />Position: Centre-back, left-back<br />Club: Bayer Leverkusen<br />Country: Ecuador</p>
<p>The young defender finished his first Bundesliga season well, following his move from Talleres in Argentina last summer, and was evidently not fazed by the immediate jump in level. Equipped with a good left foot and having fine pace, agility and alertness, the Ecuador international &#8212; who performed steadily for his country during their successful World Cup qualifying campaign &#8212; has already been singled out as one to watch by bigger clubs.</p>
<p>An ideal left-sided centre-back in a back three (though he has mainly appeared for Leverkusen on the left side of a central defensive duo, or as a left-back), he enjoys dealing with danger early and even ventures forward with the ball as an element of surprise when he claims it.</p>
<p>Hincapie is composed in possession and is generally a precise, calm passer of the ball, while he is also capable of taking charge with a last-ditch tackle or vital block in the box. Though still prone to the odd mistake, he certainly has the talent to become an elite defender in European football.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/ring1.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024" alt="Ring expert: What celeb jewelry is really worth, how to re-create it on a budget"></p>
<p>It’s no secret celebrities have more cash to splash on a dazzling diamond ring than the average person — but how much do you think the jewels are really worth?</p>
<p>One expert has revealed the actual cost of the bling — and, better yet, he’s also found a way to re-create some of the pricier pieces for a fraction of the cost.</p>
<p>Michael Fallah, 36, from Sydney, runs his own jewelry business where he creates designs for clients who typically spend $4,900 to $13,900 per piece.</p>
<p>Fallah launched a TikTok account to share his knowledge with fans, including videos in which he estimates how much celebrities’ engagement rings are really worth.</p>
<p>Starting with Kourtney Kardashian’s engagement ring — which she received from now-husband Travis Barker — Fallah estimates the ring is worth around $1 million.</p>
<p>    <img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/ring1.jpg?w=1024" alt="The expert reveals his opinion on the true value of celebrities' engagement and wedding rings." />Michael Fallah explains how to re-create a celebrity engagement ring for less.Jam Press Vid/@michaelarthurdiam    <img loading="lazy" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/Jam_Press_JMP218436.jpg?w=823" alt="Michael Fallah explains how to recreate a celebrity engagement ring for less." width="617" height="767" />The expert reveals his opinion on the true value of celebrities’ engagement and wedding rings.Jam Press Vid/@michaelarthurdiam    <img loading="lazy" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/Jam_Press_JMP218433.jpg?w=846" alt="He recommends lab grown diamonds to keep the cost down." width="618" height="747" />He recommends lab-grown diamonds to keep the cost down.Jam Press Vid/@michaelarthurdiam    </p>
<p>“Kourtney’s ring features a 12-carat oval diamond, set in platinum, and features a thin diamond band,” he says. “I would estimate [it’s worth] around $1 million.”</p>
<p>To replicate the ring, he recommends fans start by looking for an oval diamond.</p>
<p>“A 2- to 3-carat will range from $13,900 to $38,000,” he told JamPrime.com. “Opt for a thin diamond band, select platinum and then you’re done.”</p>
<p>    <img loading="lazy" width="577" height="1024" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/Jam_Press_JMP218416.jpg?w=577" alt="Fallah launched a TikTok account to share his passion." />Fallah launched a TikTok account to share his passion.Jam Press Vid/@michaelarthurdiam    </p>
<p>As for model and actress Nicola Peltz’s ring — she recently wed Brooklyn Beckham — the emerald cut ring is estimated to be worth around $346,200.</p>
<p>“Brooklyn Beckham proposed with an emerald cut valued at $242,340,” Fallah explains.</p>
<p>“But after getting married, Nicola upgraded to an oval-cut diamond with 8 to 10 carats, worth roughly $969,360.”</p>
<p>“It is complemented by her wedding band, which is roughly $470,832.”</p>
<p>    <img loading="lazy" width="577" height="1024" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/Jam_Press_JMP218419.jpg?w=577" alt="Nicola upgraded to an oval cut diamond when she got married." />Nicola Peltz upgraded to an oval-cut diamond when she got married.Jam Press Vid/@michaelarthurdiam    </p>
<p>If you don’t have a million dollars or so lying around, Fallah says lab-grown diamonds are a great way to bring the cost of wedding rings down.</p>
<p>“Lab-grown diamonds are chemically the same as natural diamonds,” he says. “We have been able to copy the natural process of a diamond being formed in the earth with machines.</p>
<p>“I would suggest all the diamonds including the side diamonds to be lab-grown to bring the costs down and make it more achievable for the average individual,” he continues, before saying you could re-create Nicola’s engagement ring for $13,848.</p>
<p>Fallah also has a look at Paris Hilton’s huge jewel — a 24-carat emerald with trapezoid accent diamonds — which he estimates is worth a huge $3.4 million.</p>
<p>    <img loading="lazy" width="577" height="1024" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/Jam_Press_JMP218426.jpg?w=577" alt="Paris Hilton's ring is estimated to be worth millions, but Fallah says you can recreate it for cheaper using lab grown diamonds." />Paris Hilton’s ring is estimated to be worth millions, but Fallah says you can re-create it for less using lab-grown diamonds.Jam Press Vid/@michaelarthurdiam    </p>
<p>Revealing how to get a ring like the hotel heir, Fallah says to “select an emerald cut for the center stone. A 1- to 2-carat would be worth roughly $4,900 to $13,900.</p>
<p>“Add a small trapezoid or baguette diamond on either side,” he explains. “Select platinum for the middle and voilà — you’re done.”</p>
<p>TikTok users were in awe of the dazzling diamonds and the expert’s insight into the cost and re-creation.</p>
<p>“So interesting,” one user wrote, while another declared they’re saving the TikToks for future reference.</p>
<p>“Did not know this!!!” marveled one dazzled viewer. “Amazing.”</p>

<p>WACO, Texas &#8212; A little league batter rose after being hit in the head to console the upset pitcher who threw the pitch during a Little League regional tournament game Tuesday in Waco, Texas.</p>
<p>The dramatic scene unfolded during a Little League Southwest Regional Playoff final.</p>
<p>Right-hander Kaiden Shelton of Pearland, Texas, was facing batter Isaiah Jarvis of Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Tuesday when an 0-2 pitch got away from him and slammed into Jarvis&#8217; helmet. Jarvis fell to the ground clutching his head as his concerned coaches ran to his aid.</p>
<p>After a few moments, Jarvis&#8217; head cleared enough for him to walk unaided to first base. Meantime, Shelton stood on the mound staring at the ground in tears over what happened.</p>
<p>After a moment, Jarvis walked to the mound and put his arms around Shelton, telling him, &#8220;Hey, you&#8217;re doing great. Let&#8217;s go.&#8221; Shelton&#8217;s teammates and coach gathered around the pair to join in consoling the young righty.</p>
<p>The gesture drew a standing ovation. Pearland went on to beat Tulsa 9-4 and advance to the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, starting next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/bleach-tiktok-99.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024" alt="People are bleaching their brows — thanks to TikTok’s bleach eyebrow filter"></p>
<p>Life’s just bleachy for these TikTokers.</p>
<p>After the bleached brow look went viral — no thanks to Kendall Jenner — TikTok released a filter that makes users look like their eyebrows are blond digitally.</p>
<p>But daring trendsetters didn’t stop at just filters. Some were inspired to actually commit to the look and bleach their brows for real.</p>
<p>The hashtags #bleachedbrow and #bleachedeyebrows have 124.4 million views and 76.5 million views, respectively, and the stylish set has apparently decided blonds have more fun — with their eyebrows, at least.</p>
<p>User @vanillamace, whose name appears to be Em, posted a clip of her trying out the bleached brow filter while also bleaching her hair. The video, now with 1.5 million views, details her thought process about embarking on the daring fad.</p>
<p>    <img loading="lazy" width="580" height="1024" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/bleach-tiktok-02.jpg?w=580" alt="TikToker dyes brows and hair" />One TikToker tried the filter when she was already dying her hair, immediately applying it to her brows too.@vanillamace    </p>
<p>“Light brow filter? Hmmmm it’s kind of nice I think?” she wrote in text for the video as she shows her face with and without the filter.</p>
<p>“Who cares might as well,” she continued, as the clip cut to her with bleach applied to her brows.</p>
<p>At first, she said, “No,” declaring that she didn’t like her new look, but she changed her mind once she applied makeup.</p>
<p>Users in her comments said the look is a “slay,” while others asked how she achieved the ultimate blond brow.</p>
<p>“Only person I’ve seen it look good on,” one person wrote.</p>
<p>“I was scared for you at first but you rock that,” complimented another.</p>
<p>“NO BC ITS SO GOOD ACTUALLY I JUST DID THE SAMEEE THING,” someone else excitedly wrote.</p>
<p>    <img loading="lazy" width="580" height="1024" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/bleach-tiktok-05.jpg?w=580" alt="TikToker dyes eyebrows despite fans telling her it looks bad" />Another user decided to dye her brows even though her followers urged her not to.@mikayla__matt    </p>
<p>The brave blond look comes after ultra-thin, 1990s brows became all the rage earlier this year among A-listers — although the fashion veterans still recovering warned against irreversible over-plucking.</p>
<p>At least hair dye is reversible?</p>
<p>Other TikTokers have hopped on and mulled over the trend, whether playing around with the filter or mildly entertaining the thought of bleaching their own brows.</p>
<p>“The urge to bleach my brows every time TikTok comes out with a new light eyebrow filter,” the text read on one video posted by @zeececilia, which garnered 71,700 views.</p>
<p>    <img loading="lazy" width="580" height="1024" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/bleach-tiktok-07.jpg?w=580" alt="TikToker dyes eyebrows brown" />One user dyed her jet-black brows to a light brown instead of bleach blonde.@gemmagarc1a    </p>
<p>But some didn’t even pause to reconsider.</p>
<p>TikToker @gemmagarc1a used box dye to drastically change her jet black brows to a light brown hue, while user @mikayla__matt dyed hers out of “spite” when her followers said she’d look unappealing with bleached brows after trying out the filter.</p>
<p>For user @soda.maillet, she wasn’t so sure she’d look good with the bleached brows since the TikTok filter alters users’ facial structures.</p>
<p>But eventually, she gave in.</p>
<p>In a clip with over 342,100 views, she reached for a box of bleach and got to work.</p>
<p>“I think it’s really cute,” she admitted in a follow-up video. “I think they suit my skin color nicer.”</p>
<p>    <img loading="lazy" width="580" height="1024" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/bleach-tiktok-03.jpg?w=580" alt="TikToker dyeing goes wrong" />But not everyone’s dyeing experience went smoothly. One user hated her yellow-tinted brows.@ellajajaja    </p>
<p>In the clips, users mostly used at-home box dye or men’s beard dye to change their brows’ hue. While beard dye is meant for the face, putting bleach in contact with fine eyebrow hairs and delicate facial skin could cause an issue.</p>
<p>“Ingredients used to bleach the hair [that include] high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide can cause serious burns,” Michelle Henry, a New York dermatologist, told Allure in 2019.</p>
<p>In fact, one survey conducted by King Saud University in Saudi Arabia showed that eyebrow bleaching could lead to redness, itching and scaling of the skin, which appeared in more than 50% of the participants. </p>
<p>“If the solution is too strong, brows and hair can be damaged,” Henry also told Allure. “Significant burns can also cause permanent hair loss. Even when done appropriately, the process can dry and damage the hair, making it more prone to breakage.”</p>
<p>But not everyone prefers blonds. User @ellajajaja made the mistake of believing she might look good with a bleached brow, but instead they ended up looking like straw.</p>
<p>“This is your sign to NOT bleach your brows because this filter ‘looks good on you,&#8217;” the text on her TikTok warned. The reveal clip, which earned 1.6 million views, was preceded by another with nearly 368,700 views, in which she showed her new look to her friends.</p>
<p>“Ella, they look so bad dye them back,” one girl in the video said, agreeing with the others who simply said, “No.” (Save for one person, who said she was “slaying.”)</p>
<p>Despite users in the comments telling her to tone them to be less yellow, she caved and used men’s beard dye to turn them back to brown — yet somehow they looked better than before.</p>
<p>“So this is my sign to bleach my eyebrows and dye them their original color? Lol,” one user commented, to which Ella said: “NO.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/club-maxs-kansas-city-punk-rockers.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024" alt="Wild tales of sex, drugs and punk rock at NYC club Max’s Kansas City: new doc"></p>
<p>The Beatles famously sang about “Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds.” But for one of the Fab Four, it was George in the Back Room with Rubies at the iconic New York rock club Max’s Kansas City.</p>
<p>The new documentary “Nightclubbing: The Birth of Punk Rock in NYC” — which will be screening at Joe’s Pub on Tuesday, Wednesday and July 30 — reveals that George Harrison had a gem of a way of picking up chicks in the VIP back room of Max’s.</p>
<p>“He always carried a little pouch of rubies,” recalled Max’s legend Alice Cooper in the doc. “And once he decided which one he wanted to be with, then he would put the ruby down in front of her. And if she picked up the ruby, that was a done deal then.”</p>
<p>“Nightclubbing” — which premiered at the Dock of the Bay Film Festival in San Sebastián, Spain,  in May — takes you inside the sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll that went down at Max’s Kansas City in the nascent thrashing of the punk-rock movement with NYC-bred acts such as the Velvet Underground, the New York Dolls and the Ramones. Not just a punk mecca, it was also the place where the likes of Bruce Springsteen and Aerosmith were signed by Clive Davis, and where Debbie Harry served new-wave attitude as a waitress before forming Blondie.</p>
<p>    <img loading="lazy" width="646" height="1024" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/Maxs_2.jpg?w=646" alt="Debbie Harry" />Debbie Harry worked as a waitress at Max’s Kansas City before forming Blondie.Getty Images    </p>
<p>“It was the cool factor,” said Cooper. “There was a lot of other little places to play, but Max’s was the place. It was the cool place.”</p>
<p>“It was one of the homes of punk,” added Billy Idol. “That’s what it was for us.”</p>
<p>Restaurateur Mickey Ruskin opened Max’s Kansas City at 213 Park Ave. South in December 1965 — eight years before the more-heralded CBGB. With a restaurant in the front and a back room for VIPs, it turned into a hipster hangout when Andy Warhol became a regular along with scenesters from his nearby studio, the Factory.</p>
<p>    <img loading="lazy" width="728" height="1024" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/Maxs_4.jpg?w=728" alt="Billy Idol" />Billy Idol performed on the closing night of Max’s Kansas City in 1981.Redferns    </p>
<p>Models and movie stars — from Warren Beatty and Jane Fonda to Jack Nicholson and Elizabeth Taylor— would mix and mingle in the buzzy back room. “It was a great place to hang out,” said Cooper. “There was nobody there trying to get your autograph, ’cause everybody was bigger than you.”</p>
<p>Max’s added live music in 1969, featuring acts such as the Stooges. Cooper recalls one particularly piercing performance by Stooges frontman Iggy Pop, who, bloodied from rolling around on glass onstage, had to get 16 stitches afterward. “I think [Stooges manager] Danny Fields and I were the ones who took him to the hospital,” he said.</p>

<p>It was also at Max’s where Iggy Pop met David Bowie, sparking their renowned creative collaboration, while Ziggy Stardust also drew inspiration from Cooper and his eponymous group for his Spiders from Mars backing band. </p>
<p>As Max’s became more of a proper live music venue with its upstairs room in the early ’70s, there was plenty of debauchery. It wasn’t uncommon to find people having sex in the bathroom or shooting amphetamine into their butt.</p>

<p>“It was all about sex and drugs,” said trans punk-rocker Jayne County.</p>
<p>County also recalled Dee Dee Ramone revealing his scarred penis after he was attacked during an altercation with his girlfriend. “She freaked out and tried to stab Dee Dee in the c–k, and tried to cut his c–k off,” she said. “And he had scars on his c–k.”</p>

<p>“Nightclubbing” also recounts how Sid Vicious played his last show at Max’s in 1978, 12 days before his girlfriend Nancy Spungen was found dead at the Chelsea Hotel. Vicious was arrested for her murder but never went to trial, because he died from a heroin overdose while out on bail.</p>
<p>Idol fondly recalled playing the closing night at Max’s Kansas City in 1981, performing “Dancing With Myself” among other tunes. “It was my way of saying thanks…cementing myself a little bit with the Max’s history in a way,” he said.</p>

<p>BLOOMINGTON, Minn. &#8212; NFL commissioner Roger Goodell says the league is seeking a tougher penalty for Deshaun Watson because the quarterback&#8217;s actions were &#8220;egregious&#8221; and &#8220;predatory behavior.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last week, the NFL formally appealed Watson&#8217;s six-game suspension, which was handed down by NFL disciplinary officer Sue. L Robinson earlier this month. At a league meeting called to formally approve the Denver Broncos&#8217; new ownership group Tuesday, Goodell was asked why the NFL appealed Robinson&#8217;s decision and was seeking a suspension of at least a year for the Cleveland Browns quarterback.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen the evidence, she was very clear about the evidence, she reinforced the evidence,&#8221; Goodell said. &#8220;There were multiple violations that were egregious, and it was predatory behavior.&#8221;</p>
<p>2 Related</p>
<p>Last week, the NFL appointed Peter C. Harvey, a former New Jersey attorney general, to hear the appeal of Watson&#8217;s suspension for violations of the NFL&#8217;s personal conduct policy. Goodell said Tuesday he did not know when Harvey would make a ruling.</p>
<p>Also Tuesday, Goodell addressed recent sanctions on the Miami Dolphins, team owner Stephen Ross and vice chairman/limited partner Bruce Beal that included stripping the team of multiple draft picks, including its 2023 first-round selection, as well as fines for Ross ($1.5 million) and Beal ($500,000).</p>
<p>Following a six-month investigation, the NFL announced last week that the Dolphins violated the anti-tampering policy on three occasions from 2019 to 2022 in conversations with quarterback Tom Brady and the agent for then-New Orleans Saints coach Sean Payton.</p>
<p>The NFL, however, did not find evidence the team intentionally lost games during the 2019 season. In February, former Dolphins coach Brian Flores said in his lawsuit alleging racism in the league&#8217;s hiring practices that Ross attempted to incentivize him to &#8220;tank,&#8221; or purposely lose games, shortly after he was hired in 2019, with Ross allegedly offering Flores $100,000 for every loss that season.</p>
<p>Goodell said Tuesday he specifically addressed the Dolphins&#8217; sanctions and the investigation with the owners after the new Broncos ownership group had been formally approved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, several things, the integrity of the game is critically important,&#8221; Goodell said. &#8220;I think the findings are very clear &#8230; and while tanking clearly did not happen here, we all have to understand our words, our actions have implications and we have to be careful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robinson issued the six-game suspension in a 16-page report, writing that &#8220;the NFL carried its burden to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Mr. Watson engaged in sexual assault (as defined by the NFL) against the four therapists identified in the Report.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also said in the report that Watson engaged in conduct that posed &#8220;a genuine danger to the safety and well-being of another person, and conduct that undermines or puts at risk the integrity of the NFL.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robinson wrote the NFL had recommended Watson be suspended for the entire 2022 regular season and postseason.</p>
<p>While relying on precedent, Robinson sought to differentiate between violent and nonviolent sexual conduct. Robinson concluded Watson&#8217;s conduct &#8220;does not fall into the category of violent conduct that would require the minimum six-game suspension&#8221; the league had established as &#8220;by far the most commonly-imposed discipline for domestic or gendered violence and sexual acts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robinson also said Watson&#8217;s &#8220;predatory conduct cast &#8216;a negative light on the League and its players.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Watson was accused of sexual assault and other inappropriate conduct during massage sessions in civil lawsuits filed by 25 women. The encounters alleged in the lawsuits took place between March 2020 to March 2021, while Watson was with the Houston Texans.</p>
<p>One of the 25 lawsuits was dropped after a judge&#8217;s ruling in April 2021 that the plaintiffs needed to amend their petitions to disclose their names. In June, Watson settled 20 of the remaining 24 lawsuits. He later agreed to settle three of the remaining four.</p>
