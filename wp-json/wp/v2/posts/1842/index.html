They are usually painless, but they can be quite painful depending on the severity of the toothache. The pain may range from a mild feeling to really intense pain.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Introduction: What is a root canal?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A root canal is a dental procedure that involves removing the roots of a tooth. The root canals are normally very small and hidden under the surface of the tooth. There are several risks associated with root canals, including infection, damage to surrounding teeth, and even death. In this article, I will explain the risks of root caries and how they can be prevented. I will also discuss some of the common symptoms that may occur as a result of root caries, such as inflammation in your gums.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Procedure: What happens during a root canal?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A root canal is a procedure that involves the removal of the affected tooth and its roots. The procedure is usually done as outpatient surgery, but it can also be done under general anesthesia. In order to do a root canal, the dentist will first make an opening in the tooth\u2019s pulp (the layer of tissue surrounding the tooth) with a special tool called an explorer. The <a href=\"https:\/\/blogbuzzers.jimdofree.com\/2022\/04\/21\/dentist-in-bakersfield-ca\/\">dentist<\/a> then uses a small drill to remove the infected and diseased root from the tooth.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Recovery Time: How long will it take for me to feel normal again?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Many people wonder how long it will take them to feel normal again after a traumatic event. The answer, of course, depends on the individual and their injury. However, in general, most people experience a gradual return to their usual routines and activities. This can take anywhere from weeks to months, but eventually, most people regain their sense of balance and feel back to their regular selves.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Complications: What are the risks of a root canal?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are a few potential complications that can arise after having a root canal. These complications may include tooth fracture, nerve damage, infection, and even death. In order to avoid these complications, it is important to be aware of the risks involved and make sure that you are treated by a <a href=\"https:\/\/probuzz.mystrikingly.com\/blog\/dentist-in-bakersfield-ca\">qualified professional<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Bottom Line: Is a root canal really that painful?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When a toothache or dental pain becomes too much to handle, most people turn to their <a href=\"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/view\/blogbuzz\/sites\/gateway-family-dentistry\">dentist<\/a>. However, many times people are unaware of the potential pain that comes with a root canal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Root canals typically involve removing part of the root of a tooth before inserting a small tube into the pulp cavity below. The goal is to remove any infected or loose material and clean out any cavities. While this procedure may not sound particularly painful, it can be extremely uncomfortable for some patients. The ADA recommends that patients receive local anesthesia if possible in order to reduce the level of pain experienced.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Root canals are one of the most common dental procedures.
