In fact, in many ways, being a periodontist is different from general dentistry. This guide will tell you some of the key differences between a dentist and a periodontist.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>General Dentist vs. Specialized Dentist<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Think of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sandiegomagazine.com\/directory\/health_medical\/dentists\/other\/nimmi-shine-dental-dentist-san-diego-ca\/business_d8eb0873-5421-5e0a-a839-31c19427cc17.html\">dentist<\/a> as your family doctor. You visit them for your checkup or when you\u2019re feeling not well. But suppose you\u2019re dealing with a specific medical condition, like a heart problem. In that case, you\u2019ll be referred to a cardiologist who is an expert in that area. Similar is the relationship between a dentist and a periodontist. A dentist deals with a whole range of oral health issues, including checkups and teeth cleaning. Whereas a periodontist diagnoses and treats more specialized conditions, which affect your gums and teeth supporting bone.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>A Specialized Area of Dentistry<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>According to American Dental Association, a periodontist is an expert in preventing, diagnosing, and treating periodontal diseases and dental implant placement. Although some dentists offer gum-related services, they are not periodontists. Why? Because periodontics is formally recognized as one of the ten specialized areas of dentistry. To become a periodontist, a dentist must obtain additional training and education after dental school.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Visit a General Dentist for:<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>\u00b7 Checkups to make sure you\u2019ve proper oral health \u00b7 Bi-Monthly Cleanings \u00b7 Filling Cavities \u00b7 Standard X-Rays \u00b7 Root Canals \u00b7 Bridges or Crowns \u00b7 Standard Tooth Extractions \u00b7 Some Cosmetic Procedures (Veneers, Bonding, Whitening, Etc.) \u00b7 Non-Surgical and Basic Periodontal Treatment<\/p>\n<h2>When to See a Periodontist<\/h2>\n<p>A family dentist can effectively treat early symptoms of gum disease and other related <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/d\/viewer?mid=1c0N5WP6uqz38P99X7CFPgLcdTzEhLnm5&amp;hl=en\">dental<\/a> issues in some cases. But when the problem has advanced past a certain point, your dentist will recommend your case to a periodontist. So, how to know if your oral health issue is severe enough to require treatment from a periodontist, you need to look for the following signs:<\/p>\n<h3><strong>1 Change in bite<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>If your teeth feel different while talking, chewing, or brushing, you should see a periodontist. A periodontist can determine the reasons for these changes and recommend suitable treatment options to solve the problem.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>2 Swollen or bleeding gums<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This is the most common sign that signals you for periodontal disease. If your gums bleed when you brush or floss, seek input from a periodontist. This can address relatively minor issues before they evolve into a more severe problem.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>3 Loose teeth<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Loose teeth can be a sign of severe infection, such as periodontitis. If you\u2019ve you\u2019ve noticed that your teeth feel loose, take it seriously and visit a periodontist. It\u2019s an excellent idea to have your teeth examined by a professional, no matter if you think it is just your imagination. Since loose teeth can be an early sign of underlying bone damage or gum disease.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>4 Receding gums<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Receding gums can occur as we age. However, it shouldn\u2019t be very noticeable. If your teeth look longer when you look in the mirror, book an <a href=\"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/view\/kbizz\/nimmi-shine\">appointment<\/a> with a periodontist. This could be a sign of advanced gum recession caused by periodontal disease.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>5 Oral pain<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>If you notice discomfort around your gums, this could be a sign of a serious oral issue. Schedule your appointment with your Periodontist in Houston, TX, so you can treat it in time. Or you can schedule a \u201c\u201ccomprehensive dental exam\u201d\u201d with your dentist to uncover the root problem.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We often get asked about what a periodontist&#8217;s job is and how it differs from a dentist&#8217;s.
