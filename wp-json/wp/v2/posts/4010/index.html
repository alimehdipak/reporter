But, teammates heard he was planning to make a big splash. Then, a loud noise was heard throughout the team facility. Everyone ran out to the practice field.<\/p>\n<p>Siragusa arrived in a helicopter, which landed squarely on the 50-yard line. The boisterous 350-pound defensive tackle hopped out and hammed it up in front of his teammates, pointing at his flexed right biceps.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat was classic,\u201d former Ravens defensive tackle Sam Adams said. \u201cAnd [coach Brian] Billick was just sitting there with his mouth open like, \u2018Why me?\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Siragusa, who died at age 55 on Wednesday, might not have made any Pro Bowls or the Ravens\u2019 Ring of Honor during or after his 12 seasons in the NFL, but teammates attest to his irrepressible and irreplaceable legacy: Siragusa was a Hall of Fame character.<\/p>\n<p>As much as Siragusa was overlooked for his run-stuffing prowess on the field, he made sure everyone saw and heard him in the locker room and in front of cameras. And, as much as the Ravens organization mourns his death, teammates know Siragusa would want them to remember him with a smile.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe would expect a roast to go on right now at his funeral,\u201d said former Ravens kicker Matt Stover, who was Siragusa\u2019s teammate for five seasons. \u201cHe would love it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/blog\/baltimore-ravens\/post\/_\/id\/56079\/\" \/>Tony Siragusa was a Hall of Fame character throughout his 12 seasons in the NFL.\u00a0Andy Lyons\/Getty Images<\/p>\n<h2>No holds-barred humor<\/h2>\n<p>Stover was one of the most dependable kickers in the NFL. He was also one of the most thick-skinned, thanks in part to Siragusa.<\/p>\n<p>The Ravens would send out Stover for a winning kick, and he would hear Siragusa curse at him, yell at him and even threaten him from the sideline.<\/p>\n<p><img data-src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0623\/r1028252_608x342_16-9.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0623\/r1028252_608x342_16-9.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Where things stand with Seahawks, DK Metcalf<br \/>\u2022 Evaluating Russell Wilson, Broncos<br \/>\u2022 Aidan Hutchinson already impressing Lions<br \/>\u2022 Dennis Allen  &#8216;keeping the DNA the same&#8217;<br \/>\u2022 Dick Vermeil&#8217;s unconventional HOF career<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>\u201cListen, you [expletive], if you miss this kick, don\u2019t come back to this sideline because I will hurt you,\u201d Siragusa would say.<\/p>\n<p>Kevin Byrne, the Ravens\u2019 longtime head of public relations, asked Stover if the trash talk helped. \u201cNo, but it does make me smile,\u201d Stover responded.<\/p>\n<p>Stover said he enjoyed the added pressure Siragusa provided. At one practice, Stover asked Siragusa to go all-out on him.<\/p>\n<p>So, the Goose pulled down his pants and mooned him.<\/p>\n<p>Siragusa\u2019s no-holds-barred sense of humor helped with more than field goals. During that 2000 championship season, the Ravens didn\u2019t score a touchdown for the whole month of October. It could have been a divisive situation with the offense failing to reach the end zone in five straight games and the defense surrendering just four touchdowns over that span.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWithout him, we would not have won that Super Bowl because that locker room could have turned so easily,\u201d Stover said. \u201cHe kept it loose. He\u2019d break the ice in the room. The guy was a tremendous force in the locker room.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Everyone was a target<\/h2>\n<p>Entering the NFL as an undrafted rookie, Siragusa prided himself on making the NFL the hard way, which is why big-name rookies rubbed him the wrong way. He told them not to park their expensive car near his because he would open his door wildly and put dents in them.<\/p>\n<p>Siragusa, who hated weigh-ins, also made rookies fill in the chart above the scale for him.<\/p>\n<p><img data-src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0512\/nfl_post_draft_power_rankings_cr_16x9_608x342.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0512\/nfl_post_draft_power_rankings_cr_16x9_608x342.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Free agency:<\/b> Grades \u00bb | More \u00bb<br \/>\u2022 <b>Draft:<\/b> Grades \u00bb | Top picks \u00bb | More \u00bb<br \/>\u2022 <b>Coaching changes:<\/b> Tracking moves \u00bb<br \/>\u2022 2022 schedule \u00bb | Power rankings \u00bb<br \/>\u2022 Barnwell ranks all 32 teams&#8217; offseason \u00bb<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPut whatever you want,\u201d Siragusa said on the inaugural season of HBO\u2019s Hard Knocks. &#8220;Put 215 [pounds]. Let\u2019s freak them out a little bit. Lost 900 pounds &#8212; today!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Siragusa endeared himself to teammates because he joked about everyone, including coaches. When then-defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis lost out on the Bills\u2019 head-coaching job, Siragusa asked him, \u201cWhat are you going to do with all the snowblowers you bought?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>No one was safe from Siragusa. In 2001, he brought paint guns to training camp to harass rookies. After Billick had threatened Siragusa and asked him to stop, the ornery defensive lineman shot a paintball at a custodian, who was on a ladder trying to clean up a paint splotch on a second story wall.<\/p>\n<p>When the hotel worker angrily came down the ladder, Siragusa took out a roll of bills from his wallet and handed it over. The custodian smiled.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe was just the life of every room he came into,\u201d former Ravens linebacker Peter Boulware said.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"380\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/blog\/baltimore-ravens\/post\/_\/id\/56079\/\" \/>Siragusa had something to say to Phil Simms after being accused of trying to injure Raiders quarterback Rich Gannon in the 2000 AFC championship game.\u00a0Jeff Haynes\/AFP\/Getty Images<\/p>\n<h2>Not fine with it<\/h2>\n<p>Siragusa didn\u2019t get penalized when he drove Rich Gannon into the turf, forcing the Raiders quarterback out of the 2000 AFC championship game. He did get a $15,000 fine, though, which he blamed on TV analyst Phil Simms.<\/p>\n<p>During the telecast of the game, Simms was emphatic that Siragusa should\u2019ve been flagged because, in Simms&#8217; view, he was trying to hurt Gannon &#8212; a claim Siragusa believed prompted the league to punish him.<\/p>\n<p>Two weeks later, Siragusa stood over Simms at a Super Bowl production meeting and told him that he owed him $15,000. When Simms said he wasn\u2019t going to be intimidated, Siragusa asked Simms about the progress of his home being built in New Jersey.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Simms asked.<\/p>\n<p>Siragusa, who is from New Jersey, responded: \u201cLet me tell you this: When you\u2019re missing $15,000 worth of shrubs, you\u2019ll know where they are.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/blog\/baltimore-ravens\/post\/_\/id\/56079\/\" \/>A beloved figure by his former Ravens teammates, Tony Siragusa helped Baltimore to a Super Bowl XXXV title in 2001.\u00a0AP Photo\/Jeff Zelevansky, File<\/p>\n<h2>Ultimate teammate<\/h2>\n<p>In October 2000, Siragusa was carted off the field in a game against the Tennessee Titans and went to the local hospital with a bruised spinal cord.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe picked him up and put him in the stretcher,\u201d Adams said. \u201cI\u2019m having tears in my eyes when they wheel him off the field. Then, I see him come back in the game and I\u2019m thinking to myself: \u2018What the hell is going on?\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Siragusa was advised not to go back in the game, but he decided to ignore the advice because he didn\u2019t want to let down his teammates. That commitment to his fellow players didn\u2019t get as much attention as his wise-cracking barbs.<\/p>\n<p>On Christmas Eve in 1999, a fire burned down the apartment of Ravens defensive end Fernando Smith. Siragusa showed up with $10,000 worth of clothes and a car filled with toys for the children.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe took care of teammates,\u201d Byrne said. \u201cHe had a generous heart.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When Siragusa came into the NFL, he spent his entire $1,000 signing bonus from the Indianapolis Colts at a bar. When he announced his retirement 12 years later, he did so at a watering hole during his weekly radio show.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of fun, a lot of memories,\u201d Siragusa said in January 2002. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m going to have to wake up and pinch myself because I\u2019ve had so much fun in my career.
