Soft cheeses like Brie and Camembert, can sit out at room temperature for up to 4 hours, according to the food safety specialists at Clemson University\u2019s Cooperative Extension.<\/p>\n<h3>What happens if you eat cheese that was left out?<\/h3>\n<p>You probably won\u2019t get sick, and definitely won\u2019t die, but the quality of cheese can plummet dramatically after more than four hours at your party. Eat something else, take out a new block of cheese from the fridge, or maybe just serve fondue at your next party. Cheese sweats are always better than sweaty cheese.<\/p>\n<p>Does packaged cheese go bad if not refrigerated?<\/p>\n<p>Soft cheeses such as cream cheese, cottage cheese, shredded cheeses, and goat cheese must be refrigerated for safety. As a general rule, hard cheeses such as cheddar, processed cheeses (American), and both block and grated Parmesan do not require refrigeration for safety, but they will last longer if kept refrigerated.<\/p>\n<p>Should cheese be served at room temperature?<\/p>\n<p>Cheese should be served at room temperature, which is ideally between 67 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Cool temperatures can compromise the flavors that our taste buds can detect.<\/p>\n<p>Is there cheese that doesn\u2019t need to be refrigerated?<\/p>\n<p>Typically, processed cheeses like American cheese don\u2019t need to be refrigerated either, at least until you open them. Some common examples of these are canned cheese, squeezable cheese, and sealed loaves or blocks of American cheese.<\/p>\n<h3>How long should cheese sit out before serving?<\/h3>\n<p>Leave cheese for at least 1 hour.<\/p>\n<p>How long can unopened shredded cheese be left out?<\/p>\n<p>How long can shredded cheddar cheese be left at room temperature?

Some cheeses and meats have a low moisture content, higher level of acid, have been smoked, or contain ingredients that help control bacterial growth.<\/p>\n<p>Does cheese go bad?<\/p>\n<p>Know when to say when: Shelf lives vary from cheese to cheese. Once opened, hard cheeses like cheddar and Swiss will stay fresh three to four weeks in your fridge, while softer varieties like ricotta, Brie and Bel Paese will hold up for about one to two weeks.<\/p>\n<h3>How long can blue cheese sit out?<\/h3>\n<p>How long can blue cheese crumbles be left at room temperature?

So if you\u2019re being extra cautious, follow the USDA guidelines that recommend you toss perishable foods, including soft cheese, that have been left out at room temperature for longer than two hours.<\/p>\n<p>Can you leave Parmesan cheese out?<\/p>\n<p>Yes, you should always refrigerate your Parmesan. Big wheels of Parmesan and large chunks of the stuff \u2014 like what you see on display at stores \u2014 don\u2019t have to be refrigerated thanks to Parmesan\u2019s low moisture content, which makes it less susceptible to bad bacteria.<\/p>\n<p>Does butter need to be refrigerated?<\/p>\n<p>If you prefer unsalted butter, refrigerate it. Same goes for whipped butter. If it creeps above 70 degrees Fahrenheit in your kitchen, all butter should go into the fridge to avoid going bad \u2014 even into the freezer if you want to store it for a few months.<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Answer: Cheese can typically sit out at room temperature anywhere from 4 to 8 hours, depending on the type, and remain safe to eat.
