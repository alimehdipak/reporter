After his nights and, no doubt, early mornings bumping shoulders with celebs such as Madonna, Liza Minnelli and \u201cthe Three Amigos\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s supermodels Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss \u2014 he went on to serve as director for the Limelight, Tunnel, Palladium and Club USA. In fact, during his club-hopping heyday, he was director for all four of the iconic NYC nightlife institutions at once.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"704\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/2-Roxy_RuPaul.jpeg?w=704\" alt=\"RuPaul at the Roxy\" \/>RuPaul made the connection that landed \u201cNocturnal Admissions\u201d author Steve Adelman his job at the Roxy.CREDIT: Alexis DiBiasio, Courtes    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI had to sort of learn on the fly because I really didn\u2019t know that much,\u201d said Adelman. <\/p>\n<p>One promoter he learned from was Susanne Bartsch, the nightlife impresario who helped to get the Roxy rocking in its early days and became a fabulous fixture of the \u201990s club scene \u2014 which she says provided a euphoric escape after the worst of the AIDS epidemic.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was time to go celebrate because we are alive and we are living life,\u201d said Bartsch, who still has her On Top! party at Le Bain on Tuesday nights this summer. \u201cIn a way, it was almost like an art gallery, so people would go and show off their looks. And it became a place to be discovered really.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"694\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/1-Roxy_Swing.jpg?w=694\" alt=\"The swing at the Roxy\" \/>The infamous swing at the Roxy provided a fun and fabulous photo op.Tina Paul, Courtesy &#8220;Nocturnal A    <\/p>\n<p>One of those nightlife stars, notorious Club Kids leader Michael Alig, brought Adelman over from the Roxy to meet mega-club owner Peter Gatien, who hired him to start working at the Limelight. <\/p>\n<p>Adelman says that even his grandmother got caught up with Alig and the Club Kids phenomenon.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy grandma came to visit me when I was there in, like, the first month,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so all the kids pull her out on the dance floor, and she\u2019s dancing around.
