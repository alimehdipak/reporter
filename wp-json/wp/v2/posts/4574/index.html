Rated PG-13 (sexual content and some violence including a sexual assault.) In theaters.<\/p>\n<p>No, the sappy film is about a beautiful woman who lives in a marsh. And don\u2019t you forget it! Based on controversial author Delia Owens\u2019 popular novel, when the dialogue isn\u2019t sanitizing abuse and rape, it\u2019s waxing poetic about sea creatures, grass and owls.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Long stretches of floral language is OK in a book. On-screen, however, it\u2019s pretentious. A slog in a bog.<\/p>\n<p>Sure, we always love to see Daisy Edgar-Jones, the talented British actress who hit it big with the brilliant miniseries \u201cNormal People.\u201d But, unlike that layered show, \u201cCrawdads\u201d gives her nothing to chew on except a Southern accent.<\/p>\n<p>We first meet her character Kya as she is arrested for the murder of a man named Chase, who fell to his death from a watchtower. To explain what happened, she tells her lawyer, an Atticus Finch type played by David Strathairn, her overly literary life story.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/where-the-crawdads-sing-2-1.jpg?w=1024\" \/>Daisy Edgar-Jones plays Kya, who townsfolk call \u201cthe marsh girl,\u201d in \u201cWhere The Crawdad Sings.\u201d \u00a9Sony Pictures\/Courtesy Everett    <\/p>\n<p>Little Kya (Jojo Regina) lives in a cabin far from a North Carolina town \u2014 you gotta use a boat to get anywhere \u2014 with her mom, siblings and a cruel father in the 1950s. When they gradually all run from their dangerous situation, including no-good pop, she\u2019s left to fend for herself.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Grown-up and gorgeous, she is shunned by the town like Hester Prynne and derisively called \u201cmarsh girl.\u201d North Carolina, we learn, is a bizarro state in which beautiful, well-dressed people are hated. But not by Kya\u2019s freakishly kind childhood friend named Tate (Taylor John Smith), who starts wooing her.

Sony Pictures    <\/p>\n<p>Tate and Chase are crudely drawn characters on-screen \u2014 an angel and devil \u2014 and we never fully embrace either. Because the story is about a woman\u2019s painful struggle, the film is afraid of ever becoming fully romantic. The only thing Kya, a keen artist, is in love with is painting pictures of snails.<\/p>\n<p>Strange, though, how hesitant director Olivia Newman is with depictions of violence. Every deplorable slap and punch is safely presented, and are overcome with unbelievable ease. Early in the movie, one of Kya\u2019s brothers \u2014 a little boy \u2014 walks out of the house having just been pummeled by their dad. Bruised, bloodied and blas\u00e9, his casual demeanor suggests he just left the candy store.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/where-the-crawdads-sing-5.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Mabel (Michael Hyatt) runs a local shop and helps Kya. \" width=\"618\" height=\"411\" \/>Mabel (Michael Hyatt) runs a local shop and helps Kya. Sony Pictures    <\/p>\n<p>Also bothersome are the characters Mabel (Michael Hyatt) and Jumpin\u2019 (Sterling Macer Jr.), flatly written black shop owners who exist solely to console and protect Kya and have no other defining details or characteristics.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Providing a hint of redemption is Edgar-Jones, a naturally vulnerable actress who can turn the shallowest of material into something deep. We like Kya and are with her every step of the way, even though at over two hours there about 50 steps too many.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>After an interminable windup (more sweeping shots of egrets!), the bombshell ending is rewarding.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, I suspect it\u2019s a lot more fun to arrive at on a Kindle.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you walk into \u201cWhere The Crawdads Sing\u201d looking for a nice animated movie about a shellfish choir, you\u2019ll be sorely disappointed. movie review Running time: 125 minutes.
