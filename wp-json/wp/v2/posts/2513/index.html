But in the land of legendary jeweler Harry Winston, the cluster is an iconic design element, where different cuts of diamonds (pear, marquise and round brilliant) are grouped together to create maximum brilliance and sparkle. The latest is a dazzling suite \u2014 necklace, earrings, bracelet and ring \u2014 of three-dimensional sculptures featuring yellow and white diamonds, accented by pink sapphires, and set in yellow gold and platinum. Don\u2019t be fooled by the delicate look of the necklace (above); it boasts a weighty 32 carats of diamonds. Ditto the bracelet at 14.5 carats, the earrings at about 4.5 carats and the absolutely mesmerizing ring, with a radiant 3-carat cushion cut yellow diamond.
