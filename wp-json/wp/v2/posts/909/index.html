Post-Cold War bridge-building through science is unraveling as Western nations seek to punish and isolate the Kremlin by drying up support for scientific programs involving Russia.<\/p>\n<p>The costs of this decoupling, scientists say, could be high on both sides. Tackling climate change and other problems will be tougher without collaboration and time will be lost. Russian and Western scientists have become dependent on each other\u2019s expertise as they have worked together on conundrums from unlocking the power of atoms to firing probes into space. Picking apart the dense web of relationships will be complicated.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/Russia-1-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"This illustration made available by the European Space Agency shows the European-Russian ExoMars rover.

The war in Ukraine is causing a swift and broad decaying of scientific ties between Russia and the West. AP    <\/p>\n<p>The European Space Agency\u2019s planned Mars rover with Russia is an example. Arrays of Russian sensors to sniff, scour and study the planet\u2019s environment may have to be unbolted and replaced and a non-Russian launcher rocket found if the suspension of their collaboration becomes a lasting rupture. In that case, the launch, already scrubbed for this year, couldn\u2019t happen before 2026.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to untangle all this cooperation which we had, and this is a very complex process, a painful one I can also tell you,\u201d the ESA director, Josef Aschbacher, said in an Associated Press interview. \u201cDependency on each other, of course, creates also stability and, to a certain extent, trust. And this is something that we will lose, and we have lost now, through the invasion of Russia in Ukraine.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>International indignation and sanctions on Russia are making formal collaborations difficult or impossible. Scientists who became friends are staying in touch informally but plugs are being pulled on their projects big and small. The European Union is freezing Russian entities out of its main 95 billion euro ($105 billion) fund for research, suspending payments and saying they\u2019ll get no new contracts. In Germany, Britain and elsewhere, funding and support is also being withdrawn for projects involving Russia.<\/p>\n<p>In the United States, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u00a0severed ties with a research university\u00a0it helped establish in Moscow. The oldest and largest university in Estonia won\u2019t accept new students from Russia and ally Belarus. The president of the Estonian Academy of Sciences, Tarmo Soomere, says the breaking of scientific connections is necessary but also will hurt.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are in danger of losing much of the momentum that drives our world towards better solutions, (a) better future,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cGlobally, we are in danger of losing the core point of science \u2014 which is obtaining new and essential information and communicating it to others.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/Russia-3-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"The ITER Tokamak machine is pictured in Saint-Paul-Lez-Durance, France, Sept. 9, 2021. \" \/>The ITER Tokamak machine is pictured in Saint-Paul-Lez-Durance, France, Sept. 9, 2021. AP    <\/p>\n<p>Russian scientists are bracing for painful isolation. An online petition by Russian scientists and scientific workers opposed to the war says it now has more than 8,000 signatories. They warn that by invading Ukraine, Russia has turned itself into a pariah state, which \u201cmeans that we can\u2019t normally do our work as scientists, because conducting research is impossible without full-fledged cooperation with foreign colleagues.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The growing estrangement is being pushed by Russian authorities, too. An order from the Science Ministry suggested that scientists no longer need bother getting research published in scientific journals, saying they\u2019ll no longer be used as benchmarks for the quality for their work.<\/p>\n<p>Lev Zelenyi, a leading physicist at the Space Research Institute in Moscow who was involved in the now-suspended collaboration on the ExoMars rover, described the situation as \u201ctragic\u201d and said by email to the AP that he and other Russian scientists must now \u201clearn how to live and work in this new non-enabling environment.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>On some major collaborations, the future isn\u2019t clear. Work continues on the 35-nation ITER fusion-energy project in southern France, with Russia still among seven founders sharing costs and results from the experiment.<\/p>\n<p>ITER spokesman Laban Coblentz said the project remains \u201ca deliberate attempt by countries with different ideologies to physically build something together.\u201d Among the essential components being supplied by Russia is a massive superconducting magnet awaiting testing in St. Petersburg before shipment \u2014 due in several years.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/Russia-2-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"A part of the cryostat component of the ITER machine is pictured in Saint-Paul-Lez-Durance, France, Sept. 9, 2021.\" \/>A part of the cryostat component of the ITER machine is pictured in Saint-Paul-Lez-Durance, France, Sept. 9, 2021.AP    <\/p>\n<p>Researchers hunting for\u00a0elusive dark matter\u00a0hope they\u2019ll not lose the more than 1,000 Russian scientists contributing to experiments at the European nuclear research organization CERN. Joachim Mnich, the director for research and computing, said punishment should be reserved for the Russian government, not Russian colleagues. CERN has already suspended Russia\u2019s observer status at the organization, but \u201cwe are not sending anyone home,\u201d\u00a0Mnich told the AP.<\/p>\n<p>In other fields as well, scientists say Russian expertise will be missed. Adrian Muxworthy, a professor at London\u2019s Imperial College, says that in his research of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field, Russian-made instruments \u201ccan do types of measurements that other commercial instruments made in the West can\u2019t do.\u201d Muxworthy is no longer expecting delivery from Russia of 250 million-year-old Siberian rocks that he had planned to study.<\/p>\n<p>In Germany, atmospheric scientist Markus Rex said\u00a0the year-long international mission\u00a0he led\u00a0into the Arctic in 2019-2020\u00a0would have been impossible without powerful Russian ships that bust through the ice to keep\u00a0their research vessel\u00a0supplied with food, fuel and other essentials. The Ukraine invasion is stopping this \u201cvery close collaboration,\u201d as well as future joint efforts to study the impact of climate change, he told the AP.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt will hurt science. We are going to lose things,\u201d Rex said. \u201cJust lay out a map and look at the Arctic. It is extremely difficult to do meaningful research in the Arctic if you ignore that big thing there that is Russia.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt really is a nightmare because the Arctic is changing rapidly,\u201d he added. \u201cIt won\u2019t wait for us to solve all of our political conflicts or ambitions to just conquer other countries.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>PARIS\u2014 Without Russian help, climate scientists worry how they\u2019ll keep up their important work of documenting warming in the Arctic.
