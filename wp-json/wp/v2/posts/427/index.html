Walker Zimmerman, Miles Robinson, James Sands, Erik Palmer-Brown and Aaron Long will be the defenders reporting to USMNT training camp in Houston this weekend.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking to ESPN&#8217;s Bundesliga play-by-play announcer Derek Rae, Brooks said he will seek to be on future squads as if his &#8220;American identity is a stake.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Months ago, I accepted responsibility for my play &amp; the decision that kept me off a roster.

There should be no questions about my desire to play for this team. My plan is to fight as hard as I can to make it back to the [USMNT].&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;My American identity is at stake, an identity some have questioned over many years. We [Americans] have all been down and out at different times, but we always fight back and I plan to do the same.&#8221;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>&#8220;My American identity is at stake, an identity some have questioned over many years.

It doesn&#8217;t determine his future with the national team. And I think that&#8217;s a very important distinction,&#8221; Berhalter said. &#8220;Like all these guys who weren&#8217;t included in the initial roster, it doesn&#8217;t mean that they don&#8217;t have a role to play in the future.<\/p>\n<h2>CONCACAF table<\/h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><\/th>\n<th>GP<\/th>\n<th>PTS<\/th>\n<th>GD<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1 &#8211; Canada<\/td>\n<td>11<\/td>\n<td>25<\/td>\n<td>+14<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 &#8211; USA<\/td>\n<td>11<\/td>\n<td>21<\/td>\n<td>+9<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 &#8211; Mexico<\/td>\n<td>11<\/td>\n<td>21<\/td>\n<td>+6<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4 &#8211; Panama<\/td>\n<td>11<\/td>\n<td>17<\/td>\n<td>+1<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 &#8211; Costa Rica<\/td>\n<td>11<\/td>\n<td>16<\/td>\n<td>1<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6 &#8211; El Salvador<\/td>\n<td>11<\/td>\n<td>9<\/td>\n<td>-7<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7 &#8211; Jamaica<\/td>\n<td>11<\/td>\n<td>7<\/td>\n<td>-7<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8 &#8211; Honduras<\/td>\n<td>11<\/td>\n<td>3<\/td>\n<td>-17<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<tfoot>\n<tr>\n<td>1-3 qualify; 4 into playoff<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tfoot>\n<\/table>\n<p>&#8220;So we did what we thought was best for this window in a way we want to play and sometimes we leave players out, sometimes we bring them in based on our opponents and based on what we&#8217;re trying to do in this window.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Brooks has not played since a September 2021 World Cup qualifier against Honduras and hasn&#8217;t been called into camp since last October as he battled a back injury. His form at Bundesliga side Wolfsburg also took a dip, but he has worked himself back into the team&#8217;s starting lineup. Nonetheless, the club announced it would part ways with the 29-year-old at the end of the season.<\/p>\n<p>Brooks has over 200 Bundesliga appearances with Hertha Berlin and Wolfsburg, including 13 games across the UEFA Champions League and Europa League.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. currently sits in second place in the eight-team group, level on points with third-place Mexico and four points in front of fourth-place Panama. The top three teams will qualify automatically, with the fourth-place finisher advancing to a playoff against a representative from Oceania in Qatar in mid-June. To guarantee automatic qualification, the U.S. would need to earn five points from the three matches.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>United States defender John Brooks said he will fight for a spot on Gregg Berhalter&#8217;s final World Cup roster should the USMNT reach Qatar despite not being called for a trio of upcoming qualifying matches.- World Cup qualifying: CONCACAF standings- 2022 World Cup: How the USMNT, Mexico can qualify- Stream on ESPN+: FC Daily |&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":428,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[13],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/427"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=427"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/427\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=427"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=427"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=427"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
