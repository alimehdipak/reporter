It&#8217;s no different for us.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Nothing has changed in terms of him being our long-term and short-term quarterback.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Murray, himself, expressed Thursday that he sees his future in Arizona in response to comments by former Cardinals Patrick Peterson and Chase Edmonds on the &#8220;All Things Covered&#8221; podcast that they believed Murray would seek an exit from the franchise because of the team&#8217;s culture.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I wanna win Super Bowls with the Cardinals, AZ is home,&#8221; Murray tweeted in response to the comments.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>I wanna win Super Bowls with the Cardinals, AZ is home. https:\/\/t.co\/xwEw42uDBl<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Kyler Murray (@K1) April 21, 2022<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Keim said he has been in contact with Murray over the past week about the team&#8217;s draft plans.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Yeah.
