She&#8217;s still available in 33.6% of leagues. It would be a good idea to add Quigley to your team&#8217;s roster if she is available in your league. Rebekah Gardner is also a solid streamer for those in deeper formats, as she&#8217;s available in 94% of leagues. Over her last six games, she has averaged 17.5 fantasy points and 19.6 minutes.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/wnba\/500\/conn.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Connecticut Sun<\/p>\n<p>Over the last eight games, Jonquel Jones has been outstanding, with an average of 17.4 PPG, 10.4 RPG, 2.8 APG, 1.1 SPG and 1.0 BPG. She is elevating her game at a perfect time for fantasy managers and the 12-5 Sun. Connecticut ranks second in offensive rating and have been a bonanza for fantasy managers. For those who are looking for a streamer, Natisha Hiedeman is available in 88% of leagues. Over the last five games, she has averaged 21.8 minutes and 17 fantasy points.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/wnba\/500\/dal.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Dallas Wings<\/p>\n<p>The Wings rank third in the league with an offensive rating of 103.5, and Isabelle Harrison (available in 45.5% of leagues) and Kayla Thornton (available in 66.9% of leagues) are two excellent streaming options. In four of her last six games, Harrison has scored 15 or more fantasy points. Four of Thornton&#8217;s last five games have seen her score 18 or more points.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/wnba\/500\/ind.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Indiana Fever<\/p>\n<p>Over the last two games, rookie Emily Engstler&#8217;s minutes have increased. She has averaged 17 minutes and 17 fantasy points in that short span, and Engstler is available in 68% of leagues. With so many rookies on the team, Engstler should see steady minutes as she develops as a WNBA player.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/wnba\/500\/lv.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Las Vegas Aces<\/p>\n<p>The Aces have exceeded expectations under new head coach Becky Hammon this season. In addition, the individual players have surpassed fantasy managers&#8217; expectations. Jackie Young (31.6), A&#8217;ja Wilson (36.9) and Kelsey Plum (34.4) all average more than 30 fantasy points per game. Meanwhile, Riquna Williams, who is still available in 87.4% of leagues, is still day to day with a foot injury. If managers are looking for exposure to the Aces high octane offense, she is an option to stash.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/wnba\/500\/la.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Los Angeles Sparks<\/p>\n<p>Katie Lou Samuelson is shockingly still available in 80.6% of leagues. Over the last 11 games, she&#8217;s averaged 10.4 PPG, 2.5 RPG, 1.5 APG and 1.1 SPG in 26.1 MPG. Though the Sparks have struggled this season, don&#8217;t overlook Samuelson in fantasy leagues.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/wnba\/500\/min.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Minnesota Lynx<\/p>\n<p>The Lynx are most likely without Sylvia Fowles for the rest of the season. She averaged 16.5 PPG and 10.3 RPG this season. For the Lynx, replacing the all-time great center is a challenge. Nikolina Milic, who is available in 92.6% of leagues, is doing her best to fill the void and has averaged 21.2 fantasy points in her last four games.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/wnba\/500\/ny.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<p>New York Liberty<\/p>\n<p>Both Han Xu and Stefanie Dolson, who are available in 77% and 80.3% of leagues respectively, are excellent streamers for fantasy managers. Three of Xu&#8217;s last five games have seen her reach 20 fantasy points or more. In two of her last four games, Dolson has scored 20 or more fantasy points.<\/p>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/wnba\/500\/phx.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Phoenix Mercury<\/p>\n<p>Shey Peddy continues to be overlooked on a Mercury team that includes Skylar Diggins-Smith, Tina Charles, Diana Taurasi, Diamond DeShields, and Brianna Turner. Peddy has averaged 17.7 fantasy points per game over the last eight games. Peddy should continue to see more minutes with Sophie Cunningham out with a sprained elbow ligament.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/wnba\/500\/sea.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Seattle Storm<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned Gabby Williams, who is available in 72.6% of leagues, in my columns before and will do it again. During the last five games, she averaged 8.2 PPG, 6.6 RPG, 5.0 APG, and 1.0 SPG. In three of her last five games, Williams has scored 20 or more fantasy points. For fantasy managers looking for a high upside streamer, she is another player trending up at the right time.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/wnba\/500\/was.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Washington Mystics<\/p>\n<p>Since mid-May, Elena Delle Donne hasn&#8217;t played three consecutive games. The Mystics will continue to provide her periodic rest days. Alysha Clark, who is available in 55.6% of leagues, benefits statistically from her absence. Clark has scored 17 or more fantasy points in four of her last five games.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jun 22, 2022Eric MoodyESPN Who is trending up in fantasy women&#8217;s basketball?
