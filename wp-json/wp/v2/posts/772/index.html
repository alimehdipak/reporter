Even after symptoms have subsided and an athlete is cleared to go back to sports, we still see neuromuscular motor control deficits, particularly when they are paired with a cognitive task. Those lingering deficits might predispose them to further injury.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Enter the intervention<\/p>\n<p>Looking for techniques to keep young athletes safer post-concussion, Howell and the investigative team devised a study in which teenage athletes who suffered concussions were randomized either to standard of care &#8212; typically returning to play after clearing a set of standardized protocols that assess symptoms, cognition, and balance &#8212; or completing the same protocol and then working with an athletic trainer on a specific neuromuscular training intervention that includes guided strength exercises and a focus on posture and landing stability.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s similar to injury risk reduction programs that are used more in population-level studies,&#8221; Howell says. &#8220;You take an entire high school soccer team and run them through these neuromuscular training programs over a season, then compare them to a team that didn&#8217;t do the program. Those studies showed that if you have a team go through this, it can reduce the risk of ACL tears, for example, pretty significantly.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Howell enrolled 27 post-concussion youth athletes in the study, most of whom were patients in the Sports Medicine Center at Children&#8217;s Hospital Colorado. The athletes who were randomized to the intervention worked with an athletic trainer two times a week for eight weeks; researchers followed them for a full year following their concussion.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We asked them every month over the following year, &#8216;Did you play sports? How many games did you have? How many practices do you have? How many hours did you participate&#8217; &#8212; plus, &#8216;Did you get injured or not?'&#8221; Howell says. &#8220;What we found is that the people who went through the intervention had about a three-and-a-half times reduced injury risk compared to the ones that did not go through the intervention over that next year.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Changing the rules on return-to-play<\/p>\n<p>Howell hopes the results from his study will eventually change the way athletes are returned to play, shifting focus from computerized tests and self-reported symptoms to a standardized intervention that can help stave off additional injuries.<\/p>\n<p>He and his research team are even working on an app that will support athletes through a self-guided training program in situations where they don&#8217;t have access to a trained clinician, such as an athletic trainer or physical therapist.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When you think about sports, it&#8217;s not just looking at a computer screen, doing a reaction time test or a single balance test,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It&#8217;s an integration of many different systems. You think about a soccer pass, for example &#8212; you&#8217;re standing here, there&#8217;s a teammate across the way to try to pass it to. But what&#8217;s your angle of your foot doing? Where are the opponents? All those things require a lot of cognitive and fine motor skills that happened in rapid succession.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If this can help with at least some of those elements that can contribute to safety, we think that can have an effect,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The results of this preliminary study were really encouraging, and I&#8217;m excited about where we&#8217;re going from here.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Story Source:<\/p>\n<p>Materials provided by University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.
