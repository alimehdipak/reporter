This massive atmosphere is made up primarily of hydrogen and helium gas, which are also the most abundant elements in our solar system. Jupiter also has a small rocky core at its center. Because of its size and mass, Jupiter exerts an incredibly strong gravitational force on other bodies in the solar system, including Earth.<\/p>\n<p>As one of the largest planets in our solar system, it\u2019s not surprising that Jupiter has such a deep and massive atmosphere. With an atmosphere nearly 100 times more massive than Earth\u2019s, Jupiter contains large amounts of hydrogen and helium gases. These two elements are also some of the most common throughout our solar system \u2013 making Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere a good representation of what the early solar system may have looked like.<\/p>\n<p>Jupiter\u2019s large size and mass also give it a very strong gravitational force, which can pull other bodies towards it. This includes Earth \u2013 as our planet orbits around the sun, Jupiter\u2019s gravity affects our own path. In fact, Jupiter is thought to be responsible for the existence of our asteroid belt!<\/p>\n<p>Despite its massive size, Jupiter actually has a very small rocky core at its center. This core is surrounded by layers of increasingly dense gas and liquid hydrogen, which make up the majority of the planet\u2019s atmosphere. Because of this composition, Jupiter doesn\u2019t have a true surface that we can stand on. Instead, its atmosphere gradually gets thicker and denser as you travel towards its center.<\/p>\n<p>While Jupiter may not be the most hospitable planet in our solar system, it certainly has a lot to offer astrobiologists. Studying this massive gas giant can help us better understand how planets and atmospheres form, and how they evolve over time. So while we might not want to live on Jupiter ourselves, studying this large planet will tell us more about our own place in the universe!<\/p>\n<p>                          Happy                    <\/p>\n<p>                                                      0                                                                            0 %                                              <\/p>\n<p>                          Sad                    <\/p>\n<p>                                                      0                                                                          0 %                                              <\/p>\n<p>                          Excited                    <\/p>\n<p>                                                      0                                                                          0 %                                              <\/p>\n<p>                          Sleepy                    <\/p>\n<p>                                                      0                                                                            0 %                                              <\/p>\n<p>Angry<\/p>\n<p>                                                      0                                                                          0 %                                                <\/p>\n<p>Surprise<\/p>\n<p>                                                      0                                                                          0 %                                              <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>0 0 0 0 Read Time:1 Minute, 42 Second what is a large planet that has a deep massive atmosphere ?
