THANK YOU &amp; MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When they got together in the summer of 1994 to write songs for the album \u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d Afanasieff and Carey carved out the chords, structure and melody for \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You\u201d in just 15 minutes. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not \u2018Swan Lake,\u2019\u2009\u201d Afanasieff admitted. \u201cBut that\u2019s why it\u2019s so popular \u2014 because it\u2019s so simple and palatable!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He also said he hasn\u2019t heard from the \u201cHoney\u201d singer since they worked on her 1997 album \u201cButterfly,\u201d after which she decided to explore a more R&amp;B-influenced direction.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shame because we had great chemistry,\u201d Afanasieff said. \u201cMy greatest dream is to work with her again.
