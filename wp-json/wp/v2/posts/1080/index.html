Wednesday.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The consulting firm, Targeted Victory, pushed to \u201cget the message out that while Meta is the current punching bag, TikTok is the real threat especially as a foreign owned app that is #1 in sharing data that young teens are using,\u201d according to an internal email from February reported by the Washington Post. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Targeted Victory reportedly advanced Meta\u2019s agenda by pushing news stories blaming dangerous online trends such as the \u201cslap a teacher challenge\u201d on TikTok \u2014 even though the trend actually originated on Facebook.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The group also helped place op-eds and letters to the editor in local papers like the Denver Post and Des Moines Register, raising concerns about China \u201cdeliberately
