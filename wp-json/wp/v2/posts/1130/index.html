The important thing is to make sure the material will suit what you\u2019ll need. Roofers near me give advice on which material will be best for your needs, and there are a few things to think about when deciding what material to settle with.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>AFFORDABILITY<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Prices for roof installation vary according to a homeowner&#8217;s needs. Some of the most affordable roofs are made from asphalt; installers charge between $350-700 per square for shingles, though higher costs ($550-700) are necessary for tile roofs or those requiring concrete or clay tiles.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>LONGEVITY<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are two main types of roofing materials, asphalt shingles, and clay tiles. Both materials can last for many years; however, clay tiles will last longer and are a more long-term investment.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>ROOFING INSTALLATION PROCESS<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You might want to invest in a roof that lasts for a long time and is relatively easy to put up, like asphalt shingles. They are easier to cut and install compared to other materials and can provide a lower cost of labor. A clay tile roof or concrete tiles might be better than asphalt but require more expertise. If you want these materials, find an expert <a href=\"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/view\/blogbuzz\/sites\/telge-roofing\">contractor<\/a> with a reputation of doing work well.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>ROOF MAINTENANCE<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Both shingles and tiles have low-maintenance qualities. Shingles require homeowners to perform regular roof inspections, where they can fix minor leaks with new shingles or repair broken shingles. Tile roofs are easy to maintain as they just need routine housekeeping such as washing and occasional replacement of tiles that have broken.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>WEIGHT<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Shingles are a lightweight material that can be installed on any type of house. Tile is heavy and can only be installed in houses with solid roofs.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>DURABILITY<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are two types of roofing materials \u00ad tiles and shingles. A shingle <a href=\"https:\/\/probuzz.mystrikingly.com\/blog\/roofing-company-in-cypress-tx\">roof<\/a> isn\u2019t durable because it can disintegrate or crack, which leaves it vulnerable to mold growth. Tile is a high-quality roofing material because it cannot rot, is resistant to UV rays, and is one of the most fire-resistant materials.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are a lot of materials you can choose from when you\u2019re building or re-roofing your home.
