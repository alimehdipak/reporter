As part of their adventures, they take in a Chicago Cubs game at Wrigley Field, where Ferris catches a foul ball. He&#8217;s almost seen by his nemesis, Dean Ed Rooney, but Rooney just misses catching a glimpse of him as the camera cuts away from his catch.<\/p>\n<p>Now, at least one lucky fan has purchased a piece of that particular bit of history.<\/p>\n<p>Heritage Auctions had acquired a ticket from the game where the scene was filmed. The ticket ended up selling Friday for $1,050.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Some fan at the game held on to their ticket and [it] turned out to be a good decision,&#8221; Mike Provenzale, sports operations supervisor and auctioneer at Heritage, told ESPN.<\/p>\n<p>The game took place Sept. 24, 1985, with the Expos beating the Cubs 17-15. Future Baseball Hall of Famer Andre Dawson was the biggest star for the Expos, going 4-for-6 with three home runs and eight RBIs.<\/p>\n<p>Tickets to high-profile sporting events have sold for quite a bit of money in the past. Heritage auctioned off a ticket from Jackie Robinson&#8217;s MLB debut for $480,000 in February, Provenzale said.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>May 13, 2022Joe DeMartinoESPN Editor Close General Editor Joined ESPN in 2006 Massachusetts native, Northwestern graduateOne of the most memorable scenes in 1986&#8217;s &#8220;Ferris Bueller&#8217;s Day Off&#8221; takes place at Wrigley Field.Ferris, his friend Cameron and Ferris&#8217; girlfriend, Sloane, have skipped school to have a memorable day out in Chicago.
