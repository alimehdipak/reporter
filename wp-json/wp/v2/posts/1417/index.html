Think of it like a Tesla versus a Prius. If you want Prius skin care to get you from A to B, shop at the health-food store. It\u2019s perfectly fine. It moisturizes, it cleanses, it smells great. But if you want real results, we need to kind of distill down a bit to, like, the molecules.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/tracie-marius.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=682\" alt=\"Marius Morariu is co-founder of Tracie Martyn, the cult-favorite beauty line and spa. \" width=\"178\" height=\"266\" \/>Marius Morariu is co-founder of Tracie Martyn, the cult-favorite beauty line and spa.     <\/p>\n<p>Hailing from a family of doctors, Romanian-born Morariu, is self-taught in distilling it down to the molecules. Though he considered becoming a physician himself, and even did pre-med hospital training in Berlin, Morariu decided early on that he was more invested in preventative care than working with patients who were already sick.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy vision of medicine is more about wellness and keeping people away from having to do surgery and take pharmaceuticals, many of which have side effects,\u201d he says. Deciding to plunge into the holistic world, he started by learning massage therapy. \u201cI thought, \u2018Let me do this completely differently and understand the body first.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That led to studying holistic nutrition and embarking on a master\u2019s degree in traditional Chinese medicine, which he did while building the Tracie Martyn brand. (Morariu got to know Martyn, then a sought-after makeup artist with a buzzy side hustle as a VIP facialist, after moving to New York City in the \u201990s.) But as driven as he was, juggling academics alongside the build-out of a jewel box Fifth Avenue day spa and a skin-care line was just too much.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/tracie-martyn-products.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Firming Serum, $198, Enzyme Exfoliant, $98, and Amla Purifying Cleanser, $68, all at TracieMartyn.com \" \/>Firming Serum, $198, Enzyme Exfoliant, $98, and Amla Purifying Cleanser, $68, all at Tracie Martyn Courtesy of Tracie Martyn    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was exhausting,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI was studying all the Chinese herb names on the train, because I didn\u2019t have time to learn them anywhere else. So I had to drop out. But it was an amazing experience, and if I ever want to go back and finish my degree, I can.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Chances are the success of Tracie Martyn \u2014 which is loved by A-list clients during Oscar season as well as cute civilians like Christian, who shares his recovery from acne on the brand\u2019s website \u2014 will ensure that never happens. Offering killer facials, a chic hideout for mommy-daughter duos like Georgia Jagger and Jerry Hall to go for a spa day, and clean skin care that actually delivers, it\u2019s firing on all cylinders.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s this whole paradigm of performance versus purity, and science versus nature,\u201d says Morariu. \u201cMy entire philosophy and vision is to show that you can actually have both.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>His name isn\u2019t on the door, and he isn\u2019t a facialist in the trenches wielding a Resculptor microcurrent gadget on his clients, but know this: Marius Morariu is the crystal ball-wielding special&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":1418,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[7],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1417"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1417"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1417\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1417"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1417"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1417"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
