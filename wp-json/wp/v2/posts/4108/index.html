So a pizza was in order.<\/p>\n<p>It started in the second inning when Mariners outfielder Jesse Winker was hit by a pitch from Angels pitcher Andrew Wantz. The Angels pitcher had also thrown a pitch behind the head of Julio Rodriguez in the first inning. Winker went toward the Angels&#8217; dugout and the tussle was on. When the dust settled, both managers and six players, including Winker and Wantz, were ejected. Angels closer Raisel Iglesias even threw a large container of sunflower seeds and gum onto the infield.<\/p>\n<p>So, a tough day at the park.<\/p>\n<p>But one Seattle fan, named Sofie on Twitter, had a plan to pick up the ejected and dejected Winker. She decided to order a pizza and have it delivered to the clubhouse.<\/p>\n<p>Using the food delivery app DoorDash, Sofie ordered from Mountain Mike&#8217;s, a West Coast pizza chain. It was to be delivered to 2000 E. Gene Autry Way in Anaheim, California. That&#8217;s the address for Angel Stadium. She even added instructions for the delivery person. &#8220;For the visitors clubhouse, pizza is for Jesse Winker.&#8221;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>I just ordered a pizza for Jesse Winker from @MountainMikes Pizza in Anaheim.
