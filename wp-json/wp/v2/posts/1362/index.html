The heady ingredient with the grungy-hippie backstory isn\u2019t for everyone, and that\u2019s a major reason why she loves it so much.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit free-spirited, like me,\u201d says the French style icon, who has fond memories of scouting for patchouli essence, years ago, in the Indian import stores of Paris. \u201cI think people have such strong reactions to it because it\u2019s distinct, like how they walk past a caf\u00e9 and suddenly want a fresh cup of coffee. I believe patchouli invokes adventure and suddenly makes one brave enough to live out their fantasies.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Roitfeld \u2014 who helmed Vogue Paris for a decade, was Tom Ford\u2019s styling ace in the pocket for years and is now overseeing a publishing, content creation and perfume empire that includes CR Fashion Book, CR Studio and a range of fragrances dubbed 7 Lovers \u2014 christened her latest scent \u201cCarine.\u201d She considers it her most personal project to date.<\/p>\n<p>She likens the experience of creating \u201cCarine\u201d to walking down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es starkers (perhaps a nod to the 2019 ad for the debut of Carine Roitfeld Parfums, in which she appeared completely nude). \u201cI wanted to create an irreverent fragrance that people didn\u2019t expect, something sensual and unpredictable, like how I create my fashion editorials or put together an outfit.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/Carine-Roitfeld-Perfume-4.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=683\" alt=\"Carine Roitfeld fragrance\" \/>\u201cCarine\u201d perfume, $260 at Carine RoitfeldMax Von Gumppenberg    <\/p>\n<p>Working in collaboration with perfumer Dominique Ropion, the creator of such seminal scents as Viktor &amp; Rolf \u201cFlowerbomb\u201d and Yves Saint Laurent \u201cY,\u201d Roitfeld steered him toward obsessions she wanted to see realized in scent form. Case in point: cashmere. \u201cHe introduced me to Cashmeran,\u201d she says, \u201ca complex synthetic ingredient so named for its ability to impart something of the softness of cashmere.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Other notes in her namesake fragrance (available at CarineRoitfeld.com, Kith in Paris and Harrods in the UK) include vetiver, jasmine, gardenia and a splash of spices.<\/p>\n<p>To promote her new labor of love, Roitfeld sat for photographer Max Von Gumppenberg, a longtime editorial collaborator. \u201cI trusted him to capture the intricacies of the fragrance through his lens,\u201d she notes. \u201cI\u2019m always delighted with his work, and he was able to bring out this side that I didn\u2019t recognize before. I feel powerful, sexy and extremely proud of the work I\u2019ve put in over the last several decades to be in a place where I am now.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Clad in head-to-toe purple and lavender, with a sliver of ruby satin bra peeking out, she says the \u201cstripped-down version of the Carine Roitfeld people have come to know\u201d in the campaign imagery mirrors the journey she went on while creating the perfume. \u201cWith \u2018Carine,\u2019 I\u2019ve opened the door to my emotions, memories, thoughts, dreams and fantasies. It\u2019s a very vulnerable thing to do, but also very cathartic.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Now 67 and a grandmother, Roitfeld says she\u2019s faithful to her Paris-based facialist, stays fit and strong with boxing and ballet classes, and has zero intention of dialing-back on her edgy sartorial style. \u201cWho says you can\u2019t wear something just because you\u2019re over a certain age? I never follow the rules, and I won\u2019t be starting anytime soon.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And really, why switch gears when you\u2019re pretty much #goals personified? \u201cSomebody recently commented on one of my Instagram posts saying, \u2018I want to age like Carine.\u2019 That made me feel beyond happy.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Carine Roitfeld is OK with the fact that patchouli, the dominant note in her eponymous new perfume, is utterly polarizing.
