It\u2019s based on the 1996 film of the same name, which followed a film crew led by a volatile director remaking a 1915 French noir called \u201cLes Vampires,\u201d about a group of criminals including Irma Vep, who wore a black catsuit.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The \u201cIrma Vep\u201d series has a similar premise, updated for modern times. Vikander stars as Mira, an American actress who\u2019s on a press tour promoting \u201cDoomsday,\u201d a superhero movie in which she stars. Her agent Zelda (Carrie Brownstein) wants her to continue doing more superhero fare, but Mira is disillusioned with her career. So, she opts to live in Paris to star in an artsy, Gothic remake of the French noir film \u201cLes Vampires,\u201d in which she\u2019ll play Irma Vep, who she describes as\u00a0\u201cthe evil muse of a criminal gang.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/alicia-vikander.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Alicia Vikander in a cat suit walking on a bridge with the Eiffel Tower in the background. \" \/>Alicia Vikander as American actress Mira, who is playing the character Irma Vep, slinking around in a catsuit in Paris.

Her director Rene Vidal (Vincent Macaigne) struggles with depression, and he wants to hew so closely to the original \u201cLes Vampires\u201d that many of his actors are having trouble parsing out their character\u2019s motivations.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Like all TV shows about making <em>other <\/em>shows or movies, \u201cIrma Vep\u201d is meta, and pokes fun at the absurdities of the entertainment industry. Aside from the surreal nature of seeing a famous actress, Vikander, play famous actress, Mira \u2014 deftly navigating interviews with the press onscreen (not unlike how Vikander herself does in real life) \u2014\u00a0\u201cIrma Vep\u201d also features scenes of actors discussing their characters\u2019 motives (while Rene shouts back, \u201cThe next time you say \u2018motivations,\u2019 I\u2019ll strangle you!\u201d). As one scene-stealing actor (played by Lars Eidinger) says, \u201cI\u2019ve been off crack for a full 24 hours.\u201d There are also many nuts-and-bolts scenes about what it takes to make a project such as \u201cIrma Vep.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/alicia-vikander_0.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Alicia Vikander sits in a chair in a large fancy room. \" \/>Alicia Vikander as Mira in \u201cIrma Vep.\u201d Photograph by Carole Bethuel\/HBO    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/vincent-macaigne-alicia-vikander.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Rene (Vincent Macaigne) talking to Mira (Alicia Vikander) outside in a field. \" \/>Rene (Vincent Macaigne) directing Mira (Alicia Vikander) in \u201cIrma Vep.\u201d Photograph by Carole Bethuel\/HBO    <\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s impossible for a show like this to avoid navel-gazing territory, but that\u2019s the nature of the genre. \u201cIrma Vep\u201d is consistently entertaining and infused with a sense of playful unpredictability, with scenes shifting in tone from dark humor to melancholia.\u00a0Since the story often jumps from following Mira or Rene \u2014 to scenes of the noir movie within the show (which features top hats, dungeons, and grandiose dialogue such as \u201cI am the vampire\u2019s grand inquisitor,\u201d) \u2014 it sometime can feel like the series is casting its net in many different directions. But, it\u2019s never confusing, and it keeps viewers on their toes as Mira\u2019s story starts echoing her character. The transporting visuals of Paris are a nice touch, too. <\/p>\n<p>Vikander plays Mira as jaded and wry in a \u201cbeen there, done that\u201d kind of way. Her American accent is halting at times, but it doesn\u2019t distract much from an otherwise playful performance that sees her disappear into the role.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>For anyone who enjoys shows such as \u201cExtras\u201d and \u201cCall My Agent\u201d or movies including \u201cBirdman,\u201d \u201cIrma Vep\u201d is a welcome addition to the genre of the film and TV industry turning within itself.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>HBO\u2019s new series \u201cIrma Vep,\u201d starring Swedish Oscar winner Alicia Vikander, is a clever satire of the entertainment industry \u2026 with a psychological bent.
