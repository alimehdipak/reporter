Twitter has tremendous potential \u2013 I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we believe it is the best path forward for Twitter\u2019s stockholders,\u201d Twitter board chair Bret Taylor said. <\/p>\n<p>Trading of Twitter\u2019s stock was halted leading up to the announcement. Twitter shares were trading at $51.98 each ahead of the pause, indicating that investors were uncertain whether the deal would actually go through.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/twitter-accepts-elon-musk-buyout-offer-03.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Twitter has accepted Elon Musk's $43 billion bid to buy the company.\" \/>Twitter has accepted Elon Musk\u2019s $44 billion bid to buy the company.AFP via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>At $44 billion, Musk\u00a0is paying more than 175 times as much for Twitter as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos paid for the Washington Post in 2013.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Ahead of the announcement, Twitter\u2019s board met on Monday to discuss Musk\u2019s proposal after shareholders warmed to the idea of a takeover.
