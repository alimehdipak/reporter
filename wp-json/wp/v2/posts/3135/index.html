It\u2019s critical to refrigerate wine after you open it. When you re-cork a bottle and refrigerate it properly, you limit the exposure of oxygen to the wine. By doing so, you delay the spoilage process and ensure your wine lasts longer (at most a week).<\/p>\n<h3>Which wines need to be refrigerated?<\/h3>\n<p>White, Ros\u00e9 and Sparkling Wine: Whites need a chill to lift delicate aromas and acidity. However, when they\u2019re too cold, flavors become muted. Like reds, fuller-bodied wines like Chardonnay from Burgundy and California shine between 50\u00b0F and 60\u00b0F. Dessert wines like Sauternes fall into the same range.<\/p>\n<p>What happens if you don\u2019t refrigerate wine?<\/p>\n<p>Initially, some wines will become more expressive, but after a while, all wines will fade away. The flavor of fresh fruit will eventually disappear and the aroma will become bland as a result of oxygen.<\/p>\n<p>Is it bad to store wine in the fridge?<\/p>\n<p>The Fridge Is Not Ideal for Storing Wine<\/p>\n<p>No matter how logical storing wine in the refrigerator may seem, the short answer is an emphatic, \u201cNo.\u201d A typical household refrigerator does not provide optimum conditions for storing wine for more than one or two days.<\/p>\n<p>What is the proper way to store wine?<\/p>\n<p>The key takeaway should be to store your wine in a dark and dry place to preserve its great taste. If you can\u2019t keep a bottle entirely out of light, keep it inside of a box or wrapped lightly in cloth. If you opt for a cabinet to age your wine, be sure to select one with solid or UV-resistant doors.<\/p>\n<h3>Does wine go bad if opened and not refrigerated?<\/h3>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t matter much how much refrigeration you have. Even when kept chilled, white wine oxidizes quickly once opened, so it is best consumed within 24 hours. Because the tannin content of red wine prevents oxidation, it can be left on the counter for a long time, re-closed.<\/p>\n<p>Can wine be stored at room temperature?<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t worry, you haven\u2019t destroyed your wine just yet. Wine can be stored at room temperature for about 6 months before any major damage has occurred, assuming it\u2019s not in direct sunlight or by your furnace. Do you know the ideal serving temperature for wine?<\/p>\n<p>What wines should not be chilled?<\/p>\n<p>Red wine that is served too warm tastes flabby and too alcoholish. In general, the ideal temperature for full-bodied reds like Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec is between 60-65 degrees Fahrenheit. It\u2019s the same for fortified wines such as Port, Marsala, and Madeira.<\/p>\n<p>Do you drink wine cold?<\/p>\n<p>Red Wine Should Be Served Cool \u2014 60 to 70 degrees<\/p>\n<p>The most common misconception with red wine is that it is ideal to serve it at room temperature, when in fact serving it cool is the best way to enjoy it. To cool red down to its proper temperature, we like to place it in the fridge an hour before serving it.<\/p>\n<h3>Can you drink opened wine after 2 weeks?<\/h3>\n<p>You can usually leave it for at least a few days before the wine starts to taste different. However, we wouldn\u2019t advise you push this too far. Pouring yourself a glass from a bottle that\u2019s been open for longer than a week may leave you with an unpleasant taste in your mouth.<\/p>\n<p>How long can wine sit out?<\/p>\n<p>Home &gt; Red Wine &gt; How Long Can Red Wine Sit Out After Opening? 3\u20135 days in a cool, dark place with a cork The more tannin and acidity in a red wine, the longer it lasts after opening. Pinot Noir, for example, will not last as long as Petite Sirah, which has more tannin.<\/p>\n<p>How long can unopened wine last?<\/p>\n<p>When stored properly and kept unopened, white wines can often outlive their recommended drinking window by 1-2 years, red wines by 2-3 years, and cooking wines by 3-5 years. Fine wine \u2014 as you may have guessed \u2014 can typically be consumed for decades.<\/p>\n<p>Is it OK to refrigerate red wine?<\/p>\n<p>Just as you store open white wine in the refrigerator, you should refrigerate red wine after opening. Beware that more subtle red wines, like Pinot Noir, can start turning \u201cflat\u201d or taste less fruit-driven after a few days in the refrigerator.<\/p>\n<p>Does red wine need to be refrigerated?<\/p>\n<p>While it\u2019s common knowledge that red wine should be enjoyed at room temperature, red wine should still be refrigerated after it\u2019s been opened. A wine fridge is a great option, too. It\u2019ll keep your wine cool enough to slow oxidation, but not as cold as a standard refrigerator.<\/p>\n<h3>Should red wine be chilled?<\/h3>\n<p>According to wine experts, red wine is best served in the range of 55\u00b0F\u201365\u00b0F, even though they say that a room temperature bottle is optimal. When red wine is too cold, its flavor becomes dull. But when red wines are too warm, it becomes overbearing with alcohol flavor.<\/p>\n<p>Where should you store wine after opening?<\/p>\n<p>Store wine in a cold, dark place.<\/p>\n<p>Place your open, re-corked bottles in the refrigerator (or a dedicated wine fridge if you have one). If you don\u2019t like the taste of cold red wine, remove the wine bottle from the fridge about one hour before serving. It will be back to room temperature by the time you pour it.<\/p>\n<p>How long can wine be stored upright?<\/p>\n<p>It also decreases oxidation so that the taste doesn\u2019t change as much over time, which is why white wines should be kept upright or refrigerated after opening while reds can keep for up to one year before they begin to oxidize and spoil.<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Yes.
