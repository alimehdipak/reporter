It measures the amount of urea nitrogen in the blood and compares it to the level of creatinine, a waste product normally eliminated by the kidneys. The ratio can help indicate how well your kidneys are working.<\/p>\n<p>To perform a bun creatinine ratio, your doctor will first order tests for both urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. Your blood will be drawn and sent to a lab for analysis. Once results are available, your doctor can calculate the ratio and interpret whether or not it indicates kidney disease.<\/p>\n<p>If you are experiencing symptoms associated with impaired kidney function, such as swelling in your legs or ankles, nausea and vomiting, or changes in urine output, you may need to have a bun creatinine ratio performed. If your results indicate that kidney disease is present, your doctor can recommend treatment options and help you manage any symptoms you are experiencing.<\/p>\n<p>If you suspect that your kidneys may not be working properly, talk with your doctor about the possibility of performing a bun creatinine ratio. Expected outcomes vary depending on the severity of the impairment and how well you comply with treatment recommendations. With prompt evaluation and management, however, most people will experience improved kidney function over time. \u200b\u200b<\/p>\n<h3>what is bun creatinine ratio high?<\/h3>\n<p>Bun creatinine ratio is the comparison between two numbers, which are blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine. This test result is used to diagnose kidney diseases and evaluate how well your kidneys are functioning. If bun creatinine ratio is high, it indicates that there is something wrong with the kidneys.<\/p>\n<p>Generally speaking, high bun creatinine ratio is caused by dehydration, impaired kidney function, or a diet high in protein. Treatment options depend on the underlying cause of your condition. In some cases, you may need to make lifestyle changes such as eating a healthy diet, limiting your fluid intake and maintaining good hydration so that your kidneys can work better. You may also need to take medication to improve kidney function. If your bun creatinine ratio is very high, you may need to undergo dialysis or a kidney transplant.<\/p>\n<p>If you have high bun creatinine ratio, it is important to see a doctor so that the underlying cause can be diagnosed and treated. Early diagnosis and treatment can help improve your prognosis and prevent further damage to your kidneys.<\/p>\n<h3>bun creatinine ratio high and Low chart:<\/h3>\n<p>The bun creatinine ratio (BCR) is a test used to help diagnose kidney disease. The BCR is calculated by dividing the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level by the creatinine level. A high BCR indicates that the kidneys are not working properly and may be a sign of kidney disease. A low BCR is not a sign of kidney disease.<\/p>\n<p>The BCR can be affected by many factors, including diet, medications, and underlying medical conditions. A normal BCR varies depending on the person\u2019s age, sex, and body size. In general, if your BCR falls outside of these ranges, you may want to consult with a healthcare provider to discuss your results and whether you may have kidney disease.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Age Range ( years) Male BCR\u00a0 \u00a0Female BCR<\/p>\n<p>20-29\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 0.40-1.10\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a00.40-1.00<\/p>\n<p>30-39\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 0.45-1.15\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a00.45-1.05<\/p>\n<p>40-49\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a00.50-1.20\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 0.50-1.10<\/p>\n<p>50-59\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a00.55-1.25\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a00.55-1.15<\/p>\n<p>60-69\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 0.60-1.30\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a00.60-1.20<\/p>\n<p>70 and over\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 0.65-1.35\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a00.65-1.25<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3>What bun creatinine ratio low?<\/h3>\n<p>Bun creatinine ratio is the ratio of two important substances in your body: bun and creatinine. This can be used to determine how well your kidneys are working. A high ratio means that your kidneys may not be functioning properly, which could mean an underlying medical condition or disease. Certain medications can also affect the ratio, so it is important to make sure your doctor knows all the medications you are taking.<\/p>\n<p>The bun creatinine ratio is a valuable tool that can help your doctor determine if there are any underlying medical conditions affecting your kidneys. If you have any questions or concerns about the ratio, be sure to discuss this with your doctor.<\/p>\n<h3>bun creatinine ratio high symptoms:<\/h3>\n<p>Creatinine is actually a waste product in the body that forms from your muscle mass. When you exercise, creatine tends to build up in your muscles, which is why athletes often take supplements of it before a big game or event. During normal function, kidneys remove creatinine from the bloodstream and excrete it through urine. If there are too many wastes stacking up in your blood, you may experience a condition called high creatinine levels.<\/p>\n<p>Creatinine levels will be elevated in the event of dehydration or kidney damage. Kidney disease is one of the most common causes of high creatinine levels. This occurs when the kidneys are not functioning properly and their ability to filter waste from the blood is diminished. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including diabetes, high blood pressure, or an infection.<\/p>\n<p>If you have renal failure, your creatinine levels will increase because your kidneys are not able to remove all of the waste from your blood. This can lead to a build-up of toxins in your blood and can cause a host of other symptoms, such as nausea, fatigue, loss of appetite, and muscle weakness.<\/p>\n<p>If you have high creatinine levels, your doctor may prescribe medication to help slow the progression of renal failure. It is also important to maintain proper hydration in order to keep your body functioning properly. If you follow your doctor\u2019s orders and take your medication as prescribed, you should see a decrease in your creatinine levels over time.<\/p>\n<p>If you have high creatinine levels and are not on dialysis, you may be able to manage your condition with a combination of medication and proper hydration. However, if your creatinine levels are too high or you have other symptoms, be sure to see your doctor right away to discuss the best course of treatment for your needs.<\/p>\n<h3>What are normal bun and creatinine levels, show the chart?<\/h3>\n<p>Normal bun and creatinine levels depend on a number of factors, such as age, gender, weight, and muscle mass.

The following chart shows the normal range for these levels in adults:<\/p>\n<p>BUN (mg\/dL): 8-20<\/p>\n<p>Creatinine (mg\/dL): 0.6-1.2<\/p>\n<p>If your Bun and creatinine levels are outside of the normal range, it is important to consult with your doctor to determine the cause. High levels may be due to dehydration, urinary tract infection, or kidney disease. Treatment will depend on the underlying cause.<\/p>\n<h3>What are potential causes of low bun and creatinine levels?<\/h3>\n<p>There are a number of things that can cause low bun and creatinine levels. Some potential causes include:<\/p>\n<p>-Kidney disease<\/p>\n<p>-Dehydration<\/p>\n<p>-Liver disease<\/p>\n<p>-Certain medications<\/p>\n<p>Low bun and creatinine levels may indicate that your kidneys are not functioning properly. Creatinine is a waste product produced by muscle metabolism, and bun (blood urea nitrogen) is a waste product produced by the breakdown of proteins. The normal range for bun is 6-24 mg\/dl, and the normal range for creatinine is 0.6-1.2 mg\/dl. A bun level of less than 6 or a creatinine level of less than 0.6 may indicate that your kidneys are not removing wastes from your body properly. If you have low bun and creatinine levels, you should see a doctor to find out the cause and to determine if treatment is necessary.<\/p>\n<p>Low bun and creatinine levels can be caused by a variety of conditions, including dehydration, kidney disease, and certain medications. If you have low bun and creatinine levels, your doctor will likely perform tests to determine the cause. Treatment for low bun and creatinine levels may include hydration, changes in diet or medications, and in some cases, dialysis or a kidney transplant.<\/p>\n<p>                          Happy                    <\/p>\n<p>                                                      0                                                                            0 %                                              <\/p>\n<p>                          Sad                    <\/p>\n<p>                                                      0                                                                          0 %                                              <\/p>\n<p>                          Excited                    <\/p>\n<p>                                                      0                                                                          0 %                                              <\/p>\n<p>                          Sleepy                    <\/p>\n<p>                                                      0                                                                            0 %                                              <\/p>\n<p>Angry<\/p>\n<p>                                                      0                                                                          0 %                                                <\/p>\n<p>Surprise<\/p>\n<p>                                                      0                                                                          0 %                                              <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>0 0 0 0 Read Time:7 Minute, 21 Second What is Bun creatinine Ratio?
