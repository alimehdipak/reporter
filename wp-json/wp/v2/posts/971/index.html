The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite Index both surged about 1.0% on the news, though both indexes are still in the red for the year. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe turn in equity markets and a risk-on environment certainly helps crypto,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a risk-on asset of the purest kind.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The rally was given an extra boost by technical factors including a wave of buying by short-sellers being forced to cover their positions, Barron\u2019s reported. <\/p>\n<p>The rally also comes amid greater institutional adoption of bitcoin. <\/p>\n<p>Earlier in March, Goldman Sachs became the first big US bank to trade bitcoin over the counter \u2014 and CoinDesk reported last week that billionaire investor Ray Dalio\u2019s Bridgewater hedge fund is preparing to back its first cryptocurrency fund. <\/p>\n<p>Garrick Hileman, research\u00a0chief at Blockchain.com, told The Post that \u201cthe changing attitude of powerful longtime crypto critics\u201d is contributing to the surge.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Bitcoin briefly traded as low as $35,000 in January and around $37,000 in February and March but quickly rebounded to $40,000 or more each time, assuring would-be buyers confidence that a massive collapse isn\u2019t in the cards, according to Hileman.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere are other factors that are giving market participants confidence to invest, including bitcoin\u2019s price showing support in the $40,000 range over the past several months,\u201d Hileman, who\u2019s also a research fellow at the London School of Economics, told The Post.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Bitcoin surged above $48,000 on Tuesday morning for the first time since 2021, putting the cryptocurrency in positive territory after a rocky start to the year.\u00a0 The world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency was&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":972,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[14],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/971"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=971"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/971\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/972"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=971"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=971"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=971"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
