He said, &#8220;We are in a good place. &#8230; I feel really good about the direction that&#8217;s going in and I think it&#8217;ll be something where it&#8217;ll be me and Les and you guys will know when that is finalized for us.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>McVay said Tuesday that he gave that answer in July because &#8220;We wanted to be able to announce that when both of us [had] gotten done.&#8221; McVay built on that further by saying that&#8217;s why he had hoped to wait to confirm his deal, prior to its mention in an extended profile of the coach posted Tuesday on ESPN.com.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It is something that we&#8217;ve been taken care of, but it is very important for Les and I to kind of have that represented as we&#8217;re a partnership and a pair,&#8221; McVay said.<\/p>\n<p>McVay, who didn&#8217;t disclose the terms of the long-expected deal, said he feels &#8220;good&#8221; about the extension, saying it was &#8220;always a really good dialogue that existed.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;These things, they take time, but I think it is important,&#8221; McVay said Tuesday. &#8220;We had a respect for the process. We wanted it to be able to be announced when both Les and I got done because of the partnership. And I think it&#8217;s only gotten better as we go, but that&#8217;s kind of where it&#8217;s at right now.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Rams, led by McVay and Snead, are coming off a Super Bowl LVI victory and their second Super Bowl appearance since McVay was hired in 2017.<\/p>\n<p>McVay, who was the youngest head coach in modern NFL history when he was hired by the Rams, has led Los Angeles to a 55-26 record in five seasons.<\/p>\n<p>Snead joined the Rams as general manager in 2012, and the franchise is 86-74-1 in his 10 seasons at the helm. In 2016, Snead moved up the draft board from the 15th pick to the first overall pick to take quarterback Jared Goff.<\/p>\n<p>His recent blockbuster trades involved adding quarterback Matthew Stafford in January 2021 and linebacker Von Miller in November 2021. He also signed wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. mid-season, another crucial piece to the Rams&#8217; playoff run and Super Bowl victory.<\/p>\n<p>Snead and the Rams&#8217; front office have also given out several large contract extensions this offseason, signing Stafford and wide receiver Cooper Kupp through the 2026 season and reworking defensive tackle Aaron Donald&#8217;s contract to make him the highest paid non-quarterback in the NFL.<\/p>\n<p><em>The Associated Press contributed to this report.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>IRVINE, Calif. &#8212; Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay said Tuesday that he signed a contract extension during the offseason, but the team was waiting to announce it until general manager Les Snead signed an extension as well, which hasn&#8217;t happened yet.During his first press conference of training camp, McVay was asked about a&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":4708,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[13],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4707"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4707"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4707\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":7284,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4707\/revisions\/7284"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4707"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4707"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4707"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
