Maradona died on November 25, 2020, at the age of 60.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;As soon as I saw the cause, I said it was homicide. I fought for a long time and here we are, with this stage completed,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Argentine prosecutors launched investigations shortly after Maradona&#8217;s death at a house near Buenos Aires, including ordering searches of properties of his personal doctor and probing others involved in his care.<\/p>\n<p>The defendants named in the ruling were Maradona&#8217;s neurosurgeon and personal doctor, Leopoldo Luque, psychiatrist Agustina Cosachov, psychologist Carlos Diaz, nurses Gisella Madrid and Ricardo Almiron, their boss Mariano Perroni, and doctors Pedro Di Spagna and Nancy Forlini.<\/p>\n<p>The defendants have denied responsibility for Maradona&#8217;s death. The judge said that lawyers for some of them had requested the case be dismissed.<\/p>\n<p>Vadim Mischanchuk, an attorney for Cosachov, said they would appeal the decision, adding the psychiatrist&#8217;s area of care had no relation with Maradona&#8217;s cause of death.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;A guilty party is being sought at all costs and objectivity is being lost,&#8221; the lawyer said.<\/p>\n<p>Reuters could not immediately reach the defendants or the other lawyers for comment.<\/p>\n<p>The crime of &#8220;simple homicide&#8221; in Argentina usually leads to a sentence of 8 to 25 years in prison, according to the country&#8217;s penal code.
