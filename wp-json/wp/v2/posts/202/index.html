Square is one of the best POS systems for retail stores and restaurants. Its retail POS plans include an online store so that you can also sell your products online.<\/p>\n<h2>Stripe: Who do we recommend it for?<\/h2>\n<p>Stripe is a versatile and easy-to-use online payment service that gives your customers a speedy and convenient checkout experience. It offers a dedicated POS terminal and a handheld terminal for multiple credit card readers, with integrated readers available as an add-on.<\/p>\n<p>But Stripe&#8217;s real focus is the online space. It&#8217;s a perfect solution for businesses that conduct international e-commerce or that are mostly or entirely online. Its online payment tools make it great for accepting various currencies from all around the world.<\/p>\n<p>Stripe may also be a better choice if you have an in-house developer who can make the payment processor work for you. The company provides extensive documentation and tutorials to speed things along.<\/p>\n<p>These are a few of Stripe&#8217;s primary benefits:\u00a0<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integration:\u00a0Stripe offers excellent integrations with hundreds of third-party apps.<\/li>\n<li>Design:\u00a0It&#8217;s designed to be an online payment system.<\/li>\n<li>Payment methods:\u00a0Stripe accepts all kinds of payment methods as well as multiple currencies.<\/li>\n<li>Convenience for developers:\u00a0Stripe is great for businesses with in-house web developers.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.business.com\/images\/content\/605\/261299c658ac7568b4567\/75_-75-\" alt=\"Tip\" width=\"75\" height=\"75\" align=\"left\" \/>Tip: Read our full review of Stripe to learn more about the payment processor and its service offerings.<\/p>\n<h2>Square: Who do we recommend it for?<\/h2>\n<p>Square is another big name in POS and payment solutions for businesses, and for a good reason: It&#8217;s been a dominant market force since 2009. It&#8217;s one of the best choices for small businesses thanks to its excellent POS tools and hardware solutions.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Square is also easy for employees to use, featuring quality out-of-the-box business management and employee management tools. No developer experience is necessary to use Square, and it can help you manage your company and your customer base relatively quickly.<\/p>\n<p>However, Square isn&#8217;t quite as versatile in terms of accepted currencies. On the plus side, Square is a little cheaper if you need a POS hardware terminal, since you get your first one for free when you sign up.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.business.com\/images\/content\/620\/e63959c658a62278b4567\/624-312-\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"312\" \/>Square offers a wide variety of affordable hardware options.<\/p>\n<p>Source: SquareUp.com<\/p>\n<p>These are some of Square&#8217;s main benefits:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Free POS terminal: The service includes a free POS hardware terminal.<\/li>\n<li>Additional tools: Square includes management and productivity tools in addition to payment processing.<\/li>\n<li>Ease of use: Square is easy to get up and running.<\/li>\n<li>Versatility:\u00a0Square is designed for brick-and-mortar payment processing, but it offers online payment options as well.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.business.com\/images\/content\/605\/261299c658ac7568b4567\/75_-75-\" alt=\"Tip\" width=\"75\" height=\"75\" align=\"left\" \/>Tip: Read our in-depth Square review for more information about its POS system and services.<\/p>\n<h2>Product and service criteria comparisons\u00a0<\/h2>\n<p>Still not sure which of the two payment processors you should choose?

The Integrated plan is a complete payment platform for online business owners who want to accept credit card payments. This plan is relatively robust, offering hundreds of free updates with no monthly or hidden fees.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The Customized plan lets you design a custom package for your business and choose precisely what you want to pay for. The Customized plan may be a better choice for larger businesses with many international customers.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.business.com\/images\/content\/620\/e64179c658a66278b4567\/624-319-\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"319\" \/>Stripe offers two main payment plans for its customers.<\/p>\n<p>Source: Stripe.com<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Square&#8217;s four plans: Square offers four plans. The Free plan is great for building a website and selling products online ASAP. The Professional plan is $12 per month and comes with a custom domain and password-protected pages. It also removes Square ads from the free version of your website.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The Performance plan is $26 per month and allows you to accept PayPal purchases. It has additional features like abandoned cart tools, advanced reporting tools and product reviews.<\/p>\n<p>The Premium plan is a little pricier at $72 per month, but it has lower credit card processing fees and discounted shipping. You&#8217;ll also be able to provide your customers with real-time shipping information. This plan is designed for larger businesses that need advanced features.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.business.com\/images\/content\/620\/e64569c658a69278b4567\/624-351-\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\" \/>Square offers four payment plans for its customers.<\/p>\n<p>Source: SquareUp.com<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Winner: Square. The company&#8217;s plans are more straightforward and broken down in a way that makes it easy for online business owners to understand what they&#8217;re getting.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Pricing<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Stripe: Stripe has a straightforward fee and pricing scheme. If you want to use Stripe&#8217;s payment platform for your current website, it&#8217;ll cost you a fee of 2.9% plus 30 cents for each credit card charge.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In-person credit card processing costs 2.7% plus 5 cents per credit card charge. International cards are more expensive, with another 1% processing fee for either type of credit card payment above.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Stripe doesn&#8217;t charge any monthly fees, and there aren&#8217;t extra charges if you accept mobile payment options like Google Pay or Apple Pay. But it does charge a $15 disputed payment fee if you ever have an issue with chargebacks.<\/p>\n<p>The first Stripe card reader you buy is a $59 flat fee. Stripe does offer a slightly cheaper POS terminal than Square, at $249.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Square: If you only use Square to accept online payments, the company&#8217;s pricing is straightforward. It costs 2.9% plus 30 cents per transaction, which is the same fee that Stripe charges.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Square is a little cheaper if you use it for in-person credit card payments. That fee is just 2.6% plus 10 cents per transaction. However, if you want to build an e-commerce store using Square, you need a paid plan and will likely incur a monthly fee.<\/p>\n<p>Square gives each customer their first card reader for free. An additional card reader costs $10. POS terminals start at $299, which is a little more expensive than what Stripe charges.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Winner: Square, thanks to its low in-person fees.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Features<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Stripe: Stripe offers a wide range of features for small business owners, including universal payment options.

The software easily integrates with QuickBooks and includes features like invoice customization and payment requests.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Square: Square also provides top-tier features, especially for online payments. It comes with fast deposits and excellent reporting tools. The software is PCI compliant, making it an excellent choice for larger businesses looking to expand their markets.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you build an online store with Square Online, you&#8217;ll also receive customizable website themes, an integrated mobile app, and a free domain name for a year. Square offers POS software, whereas Stripe does not.\u00a0<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Winner: Square, thanks to the inclusion of its POS software.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Ease of use<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Stripe: Stripe is relatively easy to use, though its reliance on third-party tools makes getting started more of a challenge. One area where Stripe stands out is the developer tools. It offers a branded and custom UI toolkit, which is ideal for business owners who know how to code or have in-house developers.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Square: One of Square&#8217;s biggest benefits is how easy the software is to use. You can get it up and running fairly quickly, whether you need to build a website from scratch or integrate payment processing into your retail storefront.

You can also integrate these tools with Stripe Billing or similar apps.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Square: Square doesn&#8217;t come with as many integrations as Stripe, but this is less important, since Square offers its own POS software.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Winner: Stripe, thanks to the numerous third-party integrations it offers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Support<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Stripe: Stripe offers an excellent range of customer service options, including live chat, 24\/7 phone support, an educational blog, and a detailed knowledge base.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Square: Square provides live chat, a knowledge base, and a blog, but it doesn&#8217;t offer phone support.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Winner: Stripe, thanks to its 24\/7 phone support.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Employee self-service<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Stripe: Stripe may not be the easiest option for your employees.
