From movie premieres to the Oscars to furthering her business empire, Williams has basically been taking over the world.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look back at what she has been up to since the last time she stepped on the court at Wimbledon:<\/p>\n<p><b>June 29, 2021:<\/b> After her devastating exit at Wimbledon, Williams followed up with an Instagram post later that day in which she said she was &#8220;heartbroken&#8221; but grateful for the fan support.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\"><\/blockquote>\n<p><b>Aug. 25, 2021:<\/b> One day before the draw reveal, Williams announced she would not be playing at the US Open because of the same injury, which she now confirmed was a torn hamstring.

The pair graced the cover of &#8220;Entertainment Weekly&#8221; with star Will Smith, appeared on his family&#8217;s &#8220;Red Table Talk&#8221; series and attended several premieres. A solo Serena stopped by &#8220;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&#8221; to talk about the movie &#8212; and even teased her return to competition by answering affirmatively to a question about being ready for the Australian Open. &#8220;Definitely,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p><b>Dec. 8, 2021:<\/b> While it seemed as if a trip Down Under was in her future during her late-night interview, Williams dashed the hopes of her fans with a statement to the Australia Open&#8217;s official website the following month. &#8220;While this is never an easy decision to make, I am not where I need to be physically to compete,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Melbourne is one of my favorite cities to visit and I look forward to playing at the AO every year.

I set my goals high. I knew I would have to be elite, and not only the best, but someone that changes the course of sport.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And now, here we are &#8212; officially unveiling the Serena building at the Nike campus. Blood sweat and many tears, many trophies &#8212; it is beyond an honor and giving me chill bumps.&#8221;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\"><\/blockquote>\n<p><b>May 3, 2022:<\/b> In a wide-ranging interview with Ellen DeGeneres, Williams talked about her business acumen, Beyonc\u00e9 and Olympia&#8217;s potential in the sport (&#8220;Are you asking as a mom or like an athlete?&#8221;) but also hinted about a potential return to competition. Responding to DeGeneres asking if she still played a lot, Williams didn&#8217;t hesitate.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I play all the time,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t played recently, but I&#8217;m actually going to get back on the court in a couple days.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><b>May 22, 2022:<\/b> The French Open was underway in Paris.

She didn&#8217;t acknowledge the tournament on any of her social media accounts but did post throughout.<\/p>\n<p>Tournament champion Iga Swiatek surpassed second-place Serena and tied Venus for the longest win streak (35) since 2000 by winning the title &#8212; and it was clear how much that distinction meant to her.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Having that 35th win and doing something more than Serena did, it&#8217;s something special,&#8221; Swiatek said. &#8220;Because I always wanted to have some kind of a record.

It&#8217;s a date. 2022 See you there.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>While it was immediately unclear if she received a wild card or was solely playing doubles, Wimbledon organizers cleared it up soon after by announcing she had received a wild card. It was also announced she will be playing doubles at Eastbourne with Ons Jabeur the week before the major. Jabeur later told the WTA she was &#8220;over the moon&#8221; about the opportunity.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\"><\/blockquote>\n<p><b>June 21, 2022:<\/b> Williams made her return to competition, playing just doubles at Eastbourne with Jabeur.
