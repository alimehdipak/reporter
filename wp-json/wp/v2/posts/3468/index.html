The organization would also welcome Snyder simply returning on his current contract for next season, sources said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Quin Snyder is one of the best coaches in the NBA,&#8221; Jazz general manager Justin Zanik said during exit interviews in late April. &#8220;There is no other partner I would rather have as a coach and as a leader of our players and as a partner in our front office than Quin Snyder.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no timetable on reaching a decision, and talks are expected to continue, sources said.<\/p>\n<p>Conversations have largely been centered on philosophical issues and how the sides can work together moving forward with a franchise trying to make the next step in Western Conference contention, sources said.<\/p>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p>Snyder expressed no interest in discussing open jobs in the marketplace this offseason, sources said, but sitting out a season would certainly leave him as one of the most sought-after candidates in 2023 and beyond. Snyder has been recovering from hip surgery since the Jazz were eliminated in six games by the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference quarterfinals.<\/p>\n<p>Snyder has a 372-264 record in eight seasons with the Jazz, matching Golden State&#8217;s Steve Kerr for the third-longest tenure with a team among active head coaches, trailing only San Antonio&#8217;s Gregg Popovich and Miami&#8217;s Erik Spoelstra. After inheriting a franchise coming off a 25-57 season, Snyder played a prominent role in Utah becoming a perennial playoff team. The Jazz have the Western Conference&#8217;s longest active postseason streak at six years, but Utah has not advanced past the conference semifinals in this era.<\/p>\n<p>Utah has undergone major changes at all levels of the organization during Snyder&#8217;s time in Utah, particularly in the past two years, including Smith&#8217;s purchase of the franchise from the Miller family and the transitioning from Dennis Lindsey to Danny Ainge as the lead basketball executive.<\/p>\n<p>Ainge and the Jazz front office face significant challenges beyond the efforts to retain Snyder in the wake of Utah&#8217;s first-round exit. The Jazz, who are projected to be deep into the luxury tax again next season, have limited roster flexibility but hope to build a championship-caliber team around All-Star shooting guard Donovan Mitchell.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>May 31, 2022Adrian WojnarowskiCloseSenior NBA InsiderHost of The Woj Pod Joined ESPN in 2017Tim MacMahonCloseESPN Staff WriterJoined ESPNDallas.com in September 2009Covers the Dallas Cowboys and Dallas MavericksAppears regularly on ESPN Dallas 103.3 FMAfter weeks of conversations with ownership and management, Utah Jazz coach Quin Snyder&#8217;s future remains unclear and a possibility exists that he could&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":3469,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[13],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3468"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3468"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3468\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3468"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3468"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3468"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
