Minnesota is coming off a heartbreaking loss to the Wings at home on Thursday, where they stormed back from a 21-point halftime deficit but came up five points short. Now they must quickly turnaround and play in Indiana. Moriah Jefferson (41.6% available) has now had three straight poor outings after a seven-game stretch where she averaged 16.1 PPG, 6.3 APG, 3.7 RPG, 2.1 3PG and 1.3 SPG in 30.1 MPG. She could potentially be up for a bounce-back effort Friday night.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/g.espncdn.com\/lm-static\/wfba\/images\/promo-cards\/wfba-1320x528_01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Experience the 2022 WNBA season like never before with the first full-featured fantasy league game dedicated to a professional women&#8217;s sport.

Victoria Vivians (52.3% available) came back from the All-Star Game fresh, scoring 17 points with four assists, three steals, two rebounds and one 3-pointer on Wednesday. The 17 points were the most she&#8217;d scored since May 27, and the four assists the most since June 15.<em> &#8212; Andre Snellings<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Best bet: Lynx -3.5<\/p>\n<p>The Lynx face the challenge of the back-to-back games, but they should be supremely motivated to get a victory. Minnesota is in the playoff hunt but a couple games back and need this win. They&#8217;re facing a Fever squad that has lost seven straight games by an average of 16.3 PPG. <em>&#8212; Snellings<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/wnba\/500\/conn.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/wnba\/500\/atl.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/> Connecticut Sun at Atlanta Dream<br \/><em>7 p.m., Gateway Center Arena, Atlanta<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Line: Sun (-8.0)<br \/>Money line: Sun (-350), Dream (+275)<br \/>Total: 154.5 points<br \/>BPI Win%: Sun (64.9%)<\/p>\n<p>Ruled Out: Rhyne Howard<\/p>\n<p>Fantasy Need to Know: The Sun came back from the All Star break with their dominant frontline rested. Jonquel Jones, Dewanna Bonner, Alyssa Thomas and Brionna Jones combined to score 63 of Connecticut&#8217;s 89 points Wednesday night. Natisha Hiedeman (87.0% available) was the leading scorer in the backcourt with 11 points, three 3-pointers and two assists.<\/p>\n<p>The Dream struggled in their last outing against the Chicago Sky. Rhyne Howard managed only seven points, shooting 3-for-10 from the floor and apparently suffered a shoulder injury that will keep her sidelined tonight. Kristy Wallace (96.0% available) is likely to start in her place and could be a solid streaming option. Cheyenne Parker returned to the starting lineup after coming off the bench Atlanta&#8217;s last game before the All-Star break. She turned in a strong 14-point, 6-rebound effort that should make fantasy managers comfortable with placing her in starting lineups as well.<em> &#8212; Andre Snellings<\/em><\/p>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p>Best bet: Sun -8.0<\/p>\n<p>The Dream have struggled of late, losing nine of their last 12 games with their five most recent losses all by double figures. In addition, Rhyne Howard has been their best player this season, and her absence will be difficult for them to overcome.<em> &#8212; Snellings<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Each day of the WNBA season, our team of fantasy and betting experts breaks down every game on the slate, making note of everything from injuries and lineup changes to recent trends and more.All odds are provided by Caesars Sportsbook.
