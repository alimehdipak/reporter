Ives said the immediate rollout of those devices shouldn\u2019t be affected since they have already been shipped.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>However, an extended lockdown would affect production of both the iPhone SE and Apple\u2019s flagship iPhone 13, the analyst said.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUltimately Apple doesn\u2019t have a demand problem, they have a supply problem that just got worse,\u201d he said.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/china-90.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Shenzhen lockdown\" \/>Authorities locked down the Chinese city of Shenzhen for at least a week. Future Publishing    <\/p>\n<p>Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company\u2019s shares were trading down 1.6% early Friday at $152.23 even as the S&amp;P 500 index was up 0.2%.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, another lockdown in the northeastern Chinese region of Changchun is creating problems for at least two major automakers.<\/p>\n<p>A Toyota plant in the region that produces RAV4 SUVs was shut down for an indefinite period of time starting on Monday, spokesperson Shiori Hashimoto told The Post.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/china-91.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"China lockdown\" \/>Toyota and Volkswagen plants in the northeastern Chinese region of Changchun are closed.

She said the company expects the shutdown to last until at least Wednesday.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>An ongoing chip shortage in 2020 and 2021 snarled production at auto plants and sent vehicle prices soaring, contributing to overall inflation. A continuing shortage of new cars could help keep inflation high in 2022.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The new wave of lockdowns also sent shockwaves through Chinese tech stocks. Alibaba plunged 9%, while Tencent shares fell 5.2% on Monday.
