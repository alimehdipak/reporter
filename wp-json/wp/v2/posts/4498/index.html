Here&#8217;s everything you need to know about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Causes: What triggers toothache?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toothache is a common pain that can develop in any area of the mouth. There are many potential causes, including tooth decay, gum disease, and sinusitis. Other possible causes include a bruise or fracture in the jawbone, infection of the tooth root or pulp, and exposure to hot foods or liquids. In some cases, toothache may be a sign of an underlying health problem. If you think you may have a tooth problem, consult your dentist for an exam.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Symptoms: What are the classic signs and symptoms of toothache?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toothache is a common symptom that can occur for many different reasons. The symptoms of toothache can vary depending on the type of toothache, but typically they will include pain and tenderness in either the front or back teeth. Other symptoms may include a decrease in appetite, nausea and vomiting, difficulty chewing or swallowing, and a decreased sense of taste.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Examination and diagnosis: How do doctors determine if someone has toothache?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toothache can be a very frustrating experience, and can be caused by many different things. Sometimes, it&#8217;s easy to determine what is causing the pain; other times, it may be more difficult. In most cases, however, doctors will use a variety of methods to determine the root cause of the toothache. Here are some common methods:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> History: Toothaches often occur when there is something wrong with the teeth themselves &#8211; for example, if there is an infection or a fracture. Doctors will ask about any recent injuries or infections in the mouth and look for any signs that something might be wrong with the teeth.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Examination: After ruling out any medical causes of the toothache, doctors will usually perform an examination to see if anything is causing it inside or outside of the mouth.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><b>Treatment: What are the most common treatments for toothache?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toothache is a common symptom, and there are many treatments available. The most common treatments are over-the-counter painkillers, ibuprofen, paracetamol, and ice packs. If the toothache is severe or lasts for more than a few days, an appointment to see a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chamberofcommerce.com\/united-states\/california\/san-jose\/dentist\/2012909998-at-dental-care\">dentist<\/a> may be necessary. In some cases, teeth can be removed if the pain is too great.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Prevention: How can you avoid toothache in the future?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prevention is key to avoiding toothache in the future. Here are a few tips:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Brush and floss regularly. Most toothaches are caused by bacteria getting trapped between teeth and gum lines. Improper brushing and flossing can remove these bacteria, preventing toothache.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Be mindful of your chewing habits. Chewing properly helps reduce the amount of stress on teeth and gums. Over-chewing can lead to toothache.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Eat a healthy diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables. A good diet will help reduce the risk of developing cavities, which can lead to toothache.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Don\u2019t smoke or use tobacco products.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Read more<\/b><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/chimney-repair-houston.business.site\/\">Chimney repair\u00a0<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Toothache is one of the most common symptoms people experience.
