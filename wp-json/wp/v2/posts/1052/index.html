The Nike collaboration is the first uniform campaign between MLB and NBA teams from the same market, but the Wizards will not debut their pink alternates until the 2022-2023 season.<\/p>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p>The Nationals will wear the cherry blossom uniforms during select games throughout the 2022 season, making their on-field debut on April 9 and April 10 against the New York Mets for the team&#8217;s home-opening weekend.<\/p>\n<p>While the Nationals mark the first team to unveil City Connect uniforms for the 2022 season, they will not be the last. The Houston Astros will debut their uniforms on April 20, the Kansas City Royals on April 30, the Colorado Rockies on June 4, the Los Angeles Angels on June 11, the Milwaukee Brewers on June 24 and the San Diego Padres on July 8.<\/p>\n<p>Major League Baseball hopes to build off the momentum from the City Connect success during the 2021 season.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We had high hopes and we probably underestimated the demand for the product,&#8221; said MLB chief revenue officer Noah Garden. &#8220;Coming out of the first year, there are some clubs that wish they went a little farther. Some of the clubs had been preparing for launch either this year or next year and got a little more aggressive.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/mlb\/story\/_\/id\/33616399\/\" \/>Washington Nationals<\/p>\n<p>Garden said the biggest takeaway from the inaugural season with the uniform designs was the importance of tying design to stories that resonate with local fan bases.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It goes a long way,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Baseball is a tremendous local sport with fan bases rabid locally, but to take that connection from your local fandom and also apply it to the city you&#8217;re from in an iconic way, we had hope [for success], but it was not anticipated.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Garden sees the Nationals&#8217; uniform as a start to bolder designs in 2022.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a departure,&#8221; Garden said. &#8220;We&#8217;re looking to reach that younger, more diverse audience in creating that &#8216;wow&#8217; moment. But a wow moment that fans can be proud of, bringing together fandoms and cities.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>City Connect uniforms are back for the 2022 Major League Baseball season.
