And as an Indian person, I was always looking to steal something from the British. So, I thought, \u2018Why not this?\u2019 I went to Robert and Michelle King, who I do \u2018Evil\u2019 with. I told them about the show. My wife and I had been watching it \u2014\u00a0 for us, it\u2019s a respite for the insanity of the world. Robert and Michelle fell in love with it, and Robert said, \u2018Why don\u2019t we make the American version?\u2019 \u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Airing Saturdays at 8:30 p.m. on The CW, the series is hosted and executive-produced by Mandvi (\u201cThe Daily Show With Jon Stewart,\u201d \u201cEvil,\u201d) and produced by the Kings.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/would-i-lie-to-you-10.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Aasif Mandvi smiling and sitting at a desk. \" \/>Aasif Mandvi hosting celebrity tall-tale show, \u201cWould I Lie To You?\u201d The CW    <\/p>\n<p>In each episode, celebrity guests such as Brooke Shields, Amber Ruffin, Laura Benanti, Michael Ian Black, Adam Pally and Richard Kind are split into two \u201cteams\u201d led by Matt Walsh (\u201cVeep\u201d) and Sabrina Jalees (\u201cSearch Party\u201d). Each celebrity takes turns reading out a scenario on a note card, and the other team must guess if they are telling the truth about something they once experienced, or telling a fib.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/would-i-lie-to-you-9.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Richard King smiles and points. \" \/>Richard Kind is one of the celeb guests who tells an outlandish story on \u201cWould I Lie To You?\u201d The CW    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/would-i-lie-to-you-7.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Dulce Sloan waves her arms while looking confused. \" \/>Dulc\u00e9 Sloan is one of the celeb guests on \u201cWould I Lie To You?\u201d The CW    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cAll the stories are amazing,\u201d said Mandvi. \u201cThere\u2019s a pre-interview, but they\u2019ve never seen the actual story until they read it on air, and they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re about to read. When you have someone like Richard Kind telling a story about giving Paul Newman a piggy back ride, that sounds insane and crazy. I\u2019m always hesitant to call this a game show, because at the end of the day, the points don\u2019t matter. It\u2019s really a fun panel show. The whole thing is an excuse for people to tell hilarious shaggy dog tales.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Mandvi is also known for HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Brink,\u201d \u201cYounger,\u201d \u201cA Series of Unfortunate Events,\u201d and \u201cBlue Bloods,\u201d among others.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been very fortunate in that I\u2019ve gotten to do a wide variety of things in my career, I\u2019ve gotten to toggle back and forth between the dramatic stuff and comedic stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m shooting \u2018Evil\u2019 now, and this [show] is a complete departure. It\u2019s a whole other side of me as a performer, as an artist. It allows me to stretch and flex both sides of my acting, comedic and dramatic.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/would-i-lie-to-you-3.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Shalewa Sharpe, Sabrina Jalees, and Rachel Feinstein sit in a row at a panel. \" \/>Shalewa Sharpe, Sabrina Jalees, and Rachel Feinstein are a celeb team on one episode.
