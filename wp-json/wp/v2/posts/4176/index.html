Bush \u2014 and it seems as though they can now add Rowling to their star-studded list.<\/p>\n<p>The multi-millionaire author \u2014 who seemingly didn\u2019t know she was being recorded \u2014 was under the impression that Zelensky called to thank her for her charity work in the country.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this year, Rowling announced she would match donations up to $1.2 million after her Lumos Foundation launched an emergency appeal to help vulnerable children and families in Ukraine.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>Fully thinking she was speaking to the president of the war-torn country, Rowling appeared invested in the conversation as the pranksters asked increasingly bizarre questions throughout the interview.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>During the increasingly-awkward 12-minute call, the impersonators asked Rowling about her thoughts on imposing sanctions on Russian actor Aleksandr Kuznetsov, who starred in the most recent\u00a0\u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d film.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFantastic Beasts\u00a0has been a very interesting experience.
