Although it differs significantly from a royal crown or tiara, dental crowns have their own honorable duty to fulfill.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides providing cover for deep-rooted cavities or tooth decay, dental crowns help to strengthen your teeth. They provide a strong baseline that supports the basic alignment of your mouth, resulting in overall improved dental hygiene.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Why Should I Get A Crown?\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main function of crowns is to keep your teeth away from harm. They&#8217;re hassle-free and offer aid in restoring the shape and size of damaged teeth. Although dental advice should be best taken by your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thewyco.com\/general\/how-much-is-oral-surgery-12-03-2021\">dentist<\/a>, if you have any of the following traits, it is most likely you will be recommended to get a crown:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enamel Wear\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tooth Decay<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Root Canal<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scaled or Shaved Down Teeth<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Internal Cracks\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Worn Implants<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gaping Cavities<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><b>Does Getting A Crown Hurt?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When done right, crowns are supposed to be absolutely pain-free. There are special anesthetics administered before any procedure that may follow, be it big or small. From numbing jelly to shots for your gums, dental crowns barely hurt at all!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While later on, you might experience discomfort or soreness, it&#8217;s only your mouth getting used to the feel of your newly crowned tooth.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>What is the process of getting a Crown?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The procedure of getting a crown might be a little lengthy, but it wraps up within two spaced-out visits. The first visit to your dentist is a consultation, where your teeth are examined for cavities, infections, or any additional process that may need to be focused on. During the first consultation, your dentist is most likely to copy the shape of your tooth by having it impressed upon a molding putty. This allows for a temporary crown to hold you up until the original procedure. The second visit though is where the crowning usually takes place. With a little glide and gentle press, your custom-made crown is fitted to your tooth, just like a new dress!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>What Types of Crowns are There?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dental crowns come in various forms, similar to actual headwear! People usually get crowns for either aesthetic appeal or to protect their <a href=\"https:\/\/blogbuzzer.weebly.com\/blog\/what-to-eat-after-wisdom-teeth-removal\">teeth<\/a>, amongst various other reasons. Here&#8217;s a list of different types of crowns you can get:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Porcelain<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ceramic (EMAX)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gold<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zirconia\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Silver<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stainless Steel<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resin<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><b>Aftercare<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make sure your journey of getting crowned stays free of pain, you should make sure to follow the instructions given by your dentist. Within the first twenty-four hours of your new dental caps, try to stick to soft foods. Any sort of hard, crunchy, crispy, sticky, or textured food can mess with the sensitivity of your teeth. Even while flossing, pay extra attention to your gums so as to not offset the placement of the crown.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Conclusion<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dental crowns are not only pain-free but they also enhance your smile and add to the overall appearance of your teeth.
