SSPL via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>Telescopes have a long and storied past. According to the American Institute of Physics, centuries of developments in lens technology and the study of optics contributed to the creation of the telescope.<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0first known telescope\u00a0was made in the Netherlands in the early 17th century. A patent was filed in October 1608 for a tube containing a concave and convex lens. Spectacle maker Hans Lippershey is often credited for the invention, which allowed for \u201cseeing faraway things as though nearby\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Then in 1609, the telescope was used to\u00a0study the night sky\u00a0for the very first time, according to NASA. Italian Galileo Galilei built his own telescope that, while small and only capable of providing a fuzzy resolution, gave the astronomer a chance to see the moon\u2019s craters and mountains, along with the Milky Way galaxy.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBefore Galileo, there had been some understanding that the Earth was at the center of the universe,\u201d Odom said. \u201cBut by using that telescope, Galileo is able to answer those questions with a precision that had eluded humanity before.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In the centuries since Galileo, telescopes have significantly grown in size and capabilities, with advanced telescopes now in observatories scattered across the globe.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe can use these great telescopes to look beyond the Solar System, which I think brings a whole new spectrum of questions together,\u201d Odom said.<\/p>\n<h2>Above it all<\/h2>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"678\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/how-telescopes-became-our-window-into-the-universe-06.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Perry Walker, a retired Air Force officer and amateur astronomer, adjusts the telescope in his self-made observatory before viewing the skies from his home near Daniel, WY, about 60 miles north of the Jonah oil and gas fields.

Denver Post via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>Advancements in telescope technology have propelled our understanding of space.<\/p>\n<p>But unlike traditional tube telescopes that \u2014 as Lippershey\u2019s patent described \u2014 allow users to see faraway objects up close, advanced telescopes allow users to \u201csee\u201d faraway objects by detecting information that\u2019s too far away and invisible to the human eye.<\/p>\n<p>The naked eye can only see a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is the full range of energy in the universe. While the electromagnetic spectrum includes a number of frequencies, such as those of X-rays and gamma rays, the frequency humans are able to see includes visible light and colors. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>But for telescopes in observatories to see what the human eye cannot, they need to have a clear view of the electromagnetic energy in space. And while placing observatories far away from city lights, on remote islands or high on mountaintops helps provide that view, the best view comes from going into space.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe think about our large ground-based observatories that look into space. It\u2019s kind of like being at the bottom of a pool and looking up,\u201d Odom said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe water is occluding what you\u2019d see, and the atmosphere performs a similar function to occlude the electromagnetic spectrum, as things like X-rays, gamma rays will bounce off,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBy getting above the atmosphere, we can look at these with a clear lens.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The first space telescopes<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"737\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/how-telescopes-became-our-window-into-the-universe-10.jpeg?w=1024\" alt=\"The Spitzer Space Telescope, one of NASA's Great Observatories, whizzes in front of a brilliant, infrared view of the Milky Way galaxy's plane in this artistic depiction. \" \/>The Spitzer Space Telescope, one of NASA\u2019s Great Observatories, whizzes in front of a brilliant, infrared view of the Milky Way galaxy\u2019s plane in this artistic depiction. NASA    <\/p>\n<p>Space telescopes were gamechangers in the field of astronomy.<\/p>\n<p>In 1968, NASA launched its first successful space telescope. Called the Orbiting Astronomical Observatory (OAO) 2, or affectionately known as \u201cStargazer\u201d, it was NASA\u2019s first observatory in the stars, giving scientists a view of the electromagnetic spectrum never before seen in space.<\/p>\n<p>OAO 2 ushered in a new era of space exploration. It helped start an initiative called America\u2019s Great Observatories, which involved the construction and launch of other and more advanced space telescopes.<\/p>\n<p>One of which was the Hubble Space Telescope. According to Odom, plans for Hubble were first proposed by astronomer Lyman Spitzer nearly 50 years before Hubble was launched in 1990.<\/p>\n<p>Later known as the \u201cFather of Hubble\u201c, Spitzer led a National Academy of Science Ad Hoc Committee on the Large Space Telescope starting in the 1960s, and then he helped lobby the U.S. Congress to obtain federal funding for what would be the Hubble Space Telescope. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>As Hubble had a \u201cfather\u201d, it too had a \u201cmother\u201c: NASA\u2019s first Chief Astronomer Nancy Grace Roman.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cShe was a network builder, she was somebody who was a collaborator,\u201d Odom said. According to Odom, Roman was at the very heart of NASA\u2019s astronomy program and due to her collaborative efforts, she was able to build support for the funding and construction of Hubble.<\/p>\n<p>On April 25, 1990, Hubble was launched into space, where is still remains operable to this day.<\/p>\n<p>Because of Hubble\u2019s location above the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, it can see with a clarity unlike any telescope that came before it. According to NASA, Hubble can see objects in space with an angular size of 0.05 arcseconds, which is similar to seeing a pair of fireflies in Tokyo that are less than 10 feet apart from Washington, D.C.<\/p>\n<h2>Challenging the status quo<\/h2>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"806\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/how-telescopes-became-our-window-into-the-universe-09.jpeg?w=806\" alt=\"Lyman Spitzer, Jr. at his desk.
