Some people who are undergoing chemotherapy also have teeth removed as the body cannot keep the mouth healthy because it\u2019s focusing on fighting cancer. Teeth are extracted during this time in order to help keep your mouth healthy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may also be having teeth extracted because you\u2019re getting your wisdom teeth removed.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who performs a tooth extraction?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A <a href=\"https:\/\/newsdigg.net\/how-to-make-an-appointment-with-temple-dentist\/\">dentist<\/a> or an oral surgeon will conduct a tooth extraction pending the severity and underlying reason for the extraction. Typically, an oral surgeon will do the extraction if there is more than one tooth being pulled and if the underlying reason is something severe such as chemo. Teeth extraction is often a quick, outpatient procedure. You may undergo anesthesia, but some dentists will only apply a local anesthetic to the area. It depends on the patient.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the teeth being removed are impacted, below the gums, or severely broken, you may need more extensive surgery and will likely see an oral surgeon as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Preparing for a tooth extraction<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily, tooth extraction procedures do not require much pre-op care. Your only job is to keep your mouth clean and possibly take antibiotics a few days prior to reduce the risk of infection. Pending the severity of your extraction, your dentist\/oral surgeon may ask you not to eat the night before or day of surgery, but this is dependent on the patient.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll need to inform your dentist\/oral surgeon if you have any of the following conditions as they pose health risks after surgery:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diabetes<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thyroid disease<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hypertension<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A congenital heart defect<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any artificial joint or bone<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">replacements in the head or jaw<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An impaired immune system<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Liver disease<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prone to excessive bleeding<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the risks and recovery time?<\/span><\/h2>\n<h4><strong>Risks:<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The risks during and post tooth extraction are rare, but they include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Infection \u2013 fever, chills, excessive pain<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cough<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swelling of the surgical site<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prolonged bleeding that lasts more than 12 hours<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chest pain and shortness of breath<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lack of blood clotting<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recovery time:<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recovery time depends on the severity of the procedure needing to be had.
