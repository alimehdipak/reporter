Robinson, has finished after three days, a source told ESPN&#8217;s Dan Graziano on Thursday.<\/p>\n<p>Watson&#8217;s hearing began Tuesday morning and ended Thursday evening.<\/p>\n<p>Watson has been accused in civil lawsuits by 25 women of actions ranging from sexual assault to inappropriate behavior during massage sessions. The NFL has been pushing for a suspension of at least a year, according to Graziano, who reported that both sides engaged in multiple attempts to reach a settlement while the hearing was still happening, but remain unable to agree.<\/p>\n<p>According to Graziano, Robinson asked for post-hearing briefs, which will be due the week of July 11.<\/p>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p>There is no set timeline for Robinson&#8217;s decision. A source told Graziano that Robinson is expected &#8220;to take her time.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>If either the union or league appeals the decision, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell or his designee &#8220;will issue a written decision that will constitute full, final and complete disposition of the dispute,&#8221; per terms of Article 46 in the collective bargaining agreement.<\/p>\n<p>One of the 25 lawsuits was dropped after the judge ruled the petition had to be amended with the plaintiff&#8217;s name. Watson and 20 of the other plaintiffs agreed to settle their lawsuits last week.<\/p>\n<p>On Monday, one of the four active civil suits was amended to name the Houston Texans as a defendant. That day, attorney Tony Buzbee, who at one time represented all 25 women, said in a statement that &#8220;the overwhelming evidence collected indicating that the Houston Texans enabled Watson&#8217;s behavior is incredibly damning.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Two grand juries in Texas declined to pursue criminal charges against Watson earlier this year. Watson has maintained his innocence.<\/p>\n<p>The Texans traded Watson to the Browns in March after the first grand jury announced it would not indict him.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Deshaun Watson&#8217;s hearing before the NFL and NFL Players Association&#8217;s jointly appointed disciplinary officer, Sue L.
