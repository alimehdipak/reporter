For this reason, BPD patients tend to be more impulsive, reckless and insecure, and thus have difficulty maintaining close relationships, according to National Institute of Mental Health. <\/p>\n<p>Those diagnosed with the condition often struggle with substance abuse and are prone to angry outbursts, self-harm and threatening suicide. Relatedly, those with histrionic personality disorder tend to have a penchant for the dramatic while exhibiting attention-seeking behavior. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/Depp_Heard_Dr_Shannon_Curry5.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Dr. Shannon Curry\" \/>REUTERS    <\/p>\n<p>Not to be confused with mood disorders, which are characterized by patients\u2019 individual emotional patterns (e.g., bipolar disorder or clinical depression), personality disorders describe people who have a harmful and counterproductive relationship with society. <\/p>\n<p>As the \u201cAquaman\u201d star\u2019s lawyers continued to question Curry\u2019s opinion of their client\u2019s mental health status, they also suggested that Depp, 58, had provoked Heard\u2019s alleged violent reactions by \u201cgaslighting,\u201d a tactic of manipulation frequently employed by narcissists.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/Depp_Heard_Dr_Shannon_Curry2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Dr. Shannon Curry\" \/>REUTERS    <\/p>\n<p>Both BPD and HPD fall into a subcategory of personality disorders all characterized by a disregard for consequences. Also in this group: antisocial personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder \u2014 the latter of which surfaced in headlines earlier Tuesday after shock jockey Howard Stern accused Depp of being a \u201chuge narcissist\u201d after watching the plaintiff\u2019s \u201coveracting\u201d on the stand earlier this week. Generally, a narcissist is defined as someone with a grossly inflated sense of self-worth.<\/p>\n<p>While Stern is no psychologist, it doesn\u2019t take a scientist to spot the parallels between events of the embattled relationship \u2014 the arguments, accusations, addictions and alleged violence \u2014 and key symptoms indicative of both BPD and narcissism. Moreover, those with either disorder are prone to rush into relationships out of their deep desire for a new partner\u2019s admiration, and end them just as quickly, as soon as that initial shine fades \u2014 all of which makes the pairing a potentially volatile combo.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/Depp_Heard_Lawsuit2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Amber Heard in Fairfax, VA court\" \/>AP    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/Depp_Heard_Lawsuit6.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Johnny Depp in Fairfax, VA court\" \/>AP        <\/p>\n<p>Though Curry\u2019s assessment is not an official diagnosis, Heard may share that with SNL comic Pete Davidson, who has been open about his struggles with borderline personality disorder, and the relief he felt upon being diagnosed, finally able to name the problem. <\/p>\n<p><em>If you or someone you know is at risk of hurting themselves, call the\u00a0National Suicide Prevention Lifeline\u00a0toll-free at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).
