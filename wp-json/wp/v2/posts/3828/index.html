I mean the whole way he took command, great collaborating as an offensive staff with him to kind of work in and nuance some of the things we do to kind of suit him and his style.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There were some questions about Ryan when the Colts acquired him from the Atlanta Falcons in March.<\/p>\n<p>One of the biggest ones was how much arm strength the 37-year-old had left. It didn\u2019t take long to realize he still has plenty of arm strength and accuracy, which was a weakness for Wentz. His ability to put perfect or near-perfect ball placement to his targets was a topic often talked about during workouts.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith Matt, that ball is out,\u201d tight end Mo Alie-Cox told reporters. \u201cLike, you come out your break, you gotta be ready. \u2019Cause it\u2019s not this slow, turn your head. Like, turn your head [and] the ball\u2019s going to be on you. But it\u2019s always going to be on point.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ryan\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is loaded with plenty of individual career success: 59,735 pass yards, 367 touchdowns, four Pro Bowls and 2016 NFL MVP.<\/p>\n<p>But joining a new team is foreign to Ryan after he spent the first 14 years of his career with the Falcons. So there was some adapting for the quarterback, as he had to get familiar with his new teammates and a coach in Reich who calls the plays and spent 13 years as an NFL quarterback.<\/p>\n<p>For Reich, adjusting to a new quarterback is nothing new, because he has had a different Week 1 starter each season since he was hired by the Colts in 2018. Ryan had only three head coaches in his 14 seasons with the Falcons.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve really enjoyed spending time with [Reich] in the meeting room, getting a feel for his philosophy as a coach and the things that he believes in,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cGetting to know him as a person, you\u2019re not going to find a better person than him. I really feel like we\u2019ve made a lot of good strides in the last two months in terms of getting on the same page and communicating.<\/p>\n<p><img data-src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0614\/r1025156_576x324_16-9.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0614\/r1025156_576x324_16-9.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Lamar Jackson&#8217;s contract situation<br \/>\u2022 DAL patient re-signing players like TE Schultz<br \/>\u2022 Can Rams pay up for stars and still win?<br \/>\u2022 Colts excited about rookie Jelani Woods<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think we\u2019ve done a good job of that, and we\u2019re going to have to continue to push that envelope as we get to training camp. It\u2019s different when you\u2019re in-game and there\u2019s wins and losses attached to it. It\u2019s different. &#8230; I think we\u2019re off to a really good start.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Colts upgraded their defense with the additions of defensive coordinator Gus Bradley and senior defensive assistant John Fox to the staff, along with cornerback Stephon Gilmore and pass-rusher Yannick Ngakoue to go with holdovers Darius Leonard and DeForest Buckner.<\/p>\n<p>But no matter how you look at it, the key to the Colts\u2019 success will hinge on how productive Ryan is at helping the Colts get back to the playoffs for just the third time since 2014 after coming up short in 2021.<\/p>\n<p>And it\u2019s not just about the stats either. That\u2019s because Wentz was productive last season on paper, throwing 27 touchdowns with just seven interceptions. But he didn\u2019t lead in the locker room, was too erratic at times throwing the ball and failed to come through late in the season when the Colts needed him to step up his play.<\/p>\n<p>Ryan, in the eyes of those inside the organization, is an improvement in all those areas over Wentz.<\/p>\n<p>Only time will tell if they are right.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, though, Ryan will spend part of the next six weeks or so before training camp throwing to his pass-catchers in small groups to help get them up to full speed when the team gets back together in late July.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou have to learn the offense. You have to know what you\u2019re talking about. You have to be able to speak their language,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing I said from the start is that you\u2019ve got to help me here, too.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>INDIANAPOLIS &#8212; Yet another offseason of workouts with a new quarterback came and went for the Indianapolis Colts last week, this time with Matt Ryan under center.This quarterback change &#8212; the fifth in as many years for the Colts &#8212; had a different feel than the one last season with Carson Wentz.It was the same&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":3829,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[13],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3828"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3828"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3828\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3828"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3828"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3828"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
