Needless to say, this complicates her dating life, especially when she sees her own future and that of a complete stranger overlapping.<\/p>\n<p>Rittenhouse, 33, answered some questions about \u201cMaggie\u201d for The Post via e-mail.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2>What attracted you to this show?\u00a0<\/h2>\n<p>The idea of playing a psychic seemed kind of fun, but honestly, it\u2019s less interesting to me than telling this relatively straightforward story about the balancing act between trying to do everything right\/trying to control all the variables in life and recognizing that we miss the experience of life if we can\u2019t just be in it \u2014 mistakes and all.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/maggie-hulu-2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Maggie (Rebecca Rittenhouse) with Ben Ben (David Del Rio) stand across from each other smiling. \" \/>Maggie (Rebecca Rittenhouse) with Ben (David Del Rio).HULU    <\/p>\n<h2>Did you do anything, in particular, to prepare for the role?<\/h2>\n<p>I talked to my family friend who is a psychic and reads tarot [cards], but honestly, Maggie being psychic isn\u2019t what the show is really about. It\u2019s really about the challenges of living your life in the moment and making the best decisions you can with the information you\u2019ve got (even when you think you know what\u2019s going to happen) because Maggie often doesn\u2019t see the whole picture. Her experience is universal in that way.<\/p>\n<h2>What parts of Maggie\u2019s life or personality do you find to be the most relatable?<\/h2>\n<p>Maggie\u2019s dating experience. She often uses her vision as an excuse to close herself off [since] she assumes she knows everything about a situation based on what she sees. She can even write people off based on silly things, but the reality is that she both wants a relationship and is scared of one, because she\u2019s afraid of getting hurt. I think we can all relate to that.\u00a0I also think her relationship with her parents can be super-relatable. She has a gift and it\u2019s kind of unbelievable, and the self-acceptance, as well as the acceptance and support from her parents, is definitely a journey.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/maggie-rebecca-rittenhouse-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Psychic Maggie (Rebecca Rittenhouse) with pals, Amy (Angelique Cabral), Jessie (Chloe Bridges) and Dave (Leonardo Nam) sit around a dinner table smiling. \" \/>Psychic Maggie (Rebecca Rittenhouse) with pals, Amy (Angelique Cabral), Jessie (Chloe Bridges), Dave (Leonardo Nam) and Ben (David Del Rio).HULU    <\/p>\n<h2>When you were thinking about how to play Maggie, did you draw inspiration from anything in particular?\u00a0<\/h2>\n<p>I think psychics, mediums, and mystics are often portrayed as odd and kooky, so I wanted Maggie to feel extremely grounded. She didn\u2019t choose to be psychic, and I think she\u2019s trying to move through the world with some sense of normalcy. I wanted to portray her as someone who is trying to accept and celebrate what\u2019s special about her without totally letting it define her.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2>What was the most enjoyable part of the role?\u00a0<\/h2>\n<p>Everyone is so funny and joyful. For whatever reason, my scenes with Ray Ford were always shot so quickly, probably because they were so fun and enjoyable \u2014 like a ping pong match.\u00a0I also absolutely loved working on Maggie\u2019s costumes\/hair and makeup. We didn\u2019t want her to look like she dressed the part of a psychic in a stereotypical way, but we definitely wanted her to have a sartorial identity. In one episode, Maggie gets invited to this super-exclusive party for psychics and mystics and she ends up feeling like an outcast. I decided to wear a totally different hairstyle from Maggie\u2019s norm in that episode because I wanted to lean into the idea that she was maybe trying too hard to fit in \u2026 and it doesn\u2019t go well.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/maggie-hulu-3.jpg?w=1024\" \/>Maggie (Rebecca Rittenhouse) is a psychic trying to date in \u201cMaggie.\u201d HULU        <\/p>\n<h2>Do you believe that psychics like Maggie can really exist?<\/h2>\n<p>Absolutely!
