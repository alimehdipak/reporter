The car&#8217;s roll-hoop was destroyed by the impact, meaning the Alfa Romeo was sliding along the floor on the Halo.<\/p>\n<p>This weekend&#8217;s Austrian Grand Prix gives Zhou an immediate chance to return to racing, something he said is important for getting his head in the right place and shaking off any lingering anxiety.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Already on Sunday I watched the race back. I didn&#8217;t feel sick watching it or have that feeling.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I feel like I was able to digest a bit myself, so I was happy mentally just having one day off and then went back into checking my physical condition. For me it wasn&#8217;t a concern.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Obviously there are times you do something and you need a bit of mental help, but this time I didn&#8217;t feel it was needed.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Zhou added: &#8220;Sunday night I was texting all my engineers asking, is my seat OK? For drivers the seat is very important. It&#8217;s been very comfortable so far, but it can be different even if they try to do the same.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton said Zhou&#8217;s accident should act as another wake-up call over the ongoing dangers of the sport.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There are still areas for improvement [in safety],&#8221; he said. &#8220;Jeez, the car getting stuck behind the barrier and the driver getting stuck in the car, we&#8217;ve got to make sure that doesn&#8217;t happen again.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;But sometimes these experiences are what open up our eyes to how much more we can improve and we will continue to do that. It&#8217;s amazing to see today how safe these cars are that you can get out and walk away, and I&#8217;m glad the drivers are safe. But It&#8217;s also a reminder to the people watching that this is a dangerous sport. We take real risks out there at crazy speeds.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Often people tune in and even people there that have known the sport for ages, sometimes take it for granted. We&#8217;re not just cruising around on a safety bumper kart. We&#8217;re exposed in a couple of areas and we&#8217;ve not got to take that for granted.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SPIELBERG, Austria &#8212; Zhou Guanyu was worried he would be trapped upside down in a burning car after his huge crash at the British Grand Prix last week.Zhou was flipped upside down and over a tyre barrier, where his Alfa Romeo then got stuck in a small gap next to a wall.1 RelatedThe Chinese driver,&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":4328,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[13],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4327"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4327"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4327\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4327"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4327"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4327"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
