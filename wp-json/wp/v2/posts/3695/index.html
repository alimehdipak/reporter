Lewan said he got a call about hosting the cup and immediately thought of crazy things that he could do when he got his hands on it.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The Stanley Cup [handlers] itself called me and said, &#8216;Hey, can I come to your house,'&#8221; Lewan said. &#8220;I was so excited. I had this idea about taking pictures with it, cuddling with it in bed, doing a whole bunch of stupid things with it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Those visions came to life when Lewan and his daughters,Wynne and Willow, put a puppy, a chicken, and a rabbit in the Stanley Cup. Lewan joked that his daughter Willow even got in the cup.<\/p>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p>Even though he&#8217;s a professional football player, Lewan seems to be more fond of the Stanley Cup than any other championship trophy.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the coolest trophy,&#8221; Lewan said. &#8220;The Lombardi is dope, but this [Stanley Cup] has the names etched in. You start etching the names in the Lombardi it would look cooler.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Lewan has developed a relationship with the Nashville Predators thanks to the days when he chugged beers off of a catfish at their games. He has developed into a hype man for the Predators who don&#8217;t hesitate to put Lewan on the big screen when he&#8217;s at their games to get the crowd going.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>incredibly humbling when the @NHL reached out and asked if I wanted THE Stanley cup at my house.<\/p>\n<p>As a kid I waited in line for 45 min with my dad just to take a picture with it before a coyotes game. <\/p>\n<p>Now all because I chugged a beer off a catfish it&#8217;s at my house. <\/p>\n<p>Grateful. pic.twitter.com\/cwL6WpK17B<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Taylor Lewan (@TaylorLewan77) May 13, 2022<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jun 7, 2022Turron DavenportESPN Close Covered Eagles for USA Today Covered the Ravens for Baltimore Times Played college football at Cheyney UniversityNASHVILLE, Tenn. &#8212; Tennessee Titans left tackle Taylor Lewan had the rare opportunity to play host to the Stanley Cup in May when he got a visit from the prized trophy.
