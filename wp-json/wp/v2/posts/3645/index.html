Not rated. On Netfflix.<\/p>\n<p>The latest contender for the title is \u201cInterceptor,\u201d a \u201cJAG\u201d episode from hell that dares to be both about the imminent annihilation of every American city by 16 stolen Russian nuclear missiles \u2026 and #MeToo. What a mix!<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFast &amp; Furious\u201d franchise actress Elsa Pataky plays JJ Collins, an Army captain who\u2019s sent to serve at her former base \u2014 a ship off Alaska that\u2019s meant to intercept missiles headed for the US \u2014 on the same day some rogues steal a bunch of the deadly weapons.<\/p>\n<p>We are told it takes just 24 minutes for a launched nuke to destroy its target in the US. Besting that impressive time, \u201cInterceptor\u201d destroyed my brain in only three.<\/p>\n<p>The threat of disaster comes, not from war-hungry Russians, but treasonous American Army traitors. Says one: \u201cI took an oath to the old America \u2014 not this one.\u201d Er, what?<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/Interceptor_DSC8082R-copy.jpg?w=1024\" \/>Elsa Pataky plays JJ Collins, a nondescript Army badass, in \u201cInterceptor.\u201d Netflix    <\/p>\n<p>#MeToo comes into play because a few years earlier, JJ was harassed by a three-star general, and when she tried to expose him she became a pariah despite her superhero-like abilities. The movie appears to say that if the #MeToo movement succeeds, Tampa will be saved from nuclear ruin.<\/p>\n<p>Say you did not click \u201cplay\u201d in hopes of a gripping plot, fleshed-out characters and a decent twist. Fine. But you\u2019ll also be disappointed with the action sequences.<\/p>\n<p>Pataky\u2019s character engages in yawn-worthy hand-to-hand combat with the intruders (Luke Bracey\u2019s performance as the main baddie gets four snores), if not believable exchanges of dialogue, as she tries to protect the interceptors from being controlled. A man sizzling in sulfuric acid and a guy\u2019s head\u00a0being chopped off by a chain straddle the boring line between reasonable quality and campy badness.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/Interceptor_DSC2800R-copy.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"The actors are often separated by walls and the effect is cheap and uninvolving. \" \/>The actors are often separated by walls and the effect is cheap and uninvolving. Brook Rushton\/Netflix    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cInterceptor\u201d also looks horrendous.<\/p>\n<p>For much of the movie JJ is locked away in a control room by herself, and an emergency video feed airs her travails all over the world. This is when we most keenly feel Netflix\u2019s quality-be-damned, \u201cWe are the Borg. Resistance is futile\u201d mentality. Tossing one person in a room for a while saves money (this thing cost a few pennies and pocket lint) and the natural isolation of the story allowed the studio to keep churning out duds during the pandemic. This is director Matthew Reilly\u2019s first film. If I were him, I\u2019d consider leaving it off my CV.<\/p>\n<p>Like our high New York taxes not fixing enough potholes, crummy movies like this one make us question exactly what our subscription dollars are being used for. Was it for a new gym at Netflix?
