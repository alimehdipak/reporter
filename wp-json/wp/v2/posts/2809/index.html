They were asked to rate the women on a myriad of characteristics, including\u00a0their physical attractiveness, sexual attractiveness, dominance, strength, warmth, enthusiasm, trustworthiness, nurturance, masculinity, femininity, social competence, affectionateness, friendliness, overall good mate potential, short-term mate potential, long-term mate potential, parenting ability, health, intelligence, success and status.<\/p>\n<p>The woman in high heels was perceived as being more sexually attractive, physically attractive, feminine and of higher status by the majority of those surveyed.<\/p>\n<p>But when it comes to perception of socioeconomics, male and female opinions differed.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/women-heels-work-study-03.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Woman walking in high heels\" \/>The study found that women in heels were perceived as being of higher status.Shutterstock    <\/p>\n<p>In particular, women rated other women as having a higher status regardless of the shoe. Meanwhile, men rated women as having higher short- and long-term mating potential than women did, regardless of the shoe. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhile women\u2019s fashion constantly evolves, this research aligns well with previous research that men perceive women in high heels as more attractive than those in flat shoes,\u201d the report read.<\/p>\n<p>However, wearing high heels did not have women interpreted as more dominant, strong, warm, enthusiastic, trustworthy, nurturing, socially competent, healthy, intelligent, affectionate, friendly or successful.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/heels-32.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"The study concluded that the increased perception of attractiveness may have to do with a change in the wearer's lumbar (spinal) curve, which gives their breast and buttocks a lift to appear perkier.\" \/>The study concluded that the increased perception of attractiveness might have to do with changing the wearer\u2019s lumbar (spinal) curve, which gives their breast and buttocks a lift to appear perkier.Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>Unlike some other articles of women\u2019s clothing and accessories, the researchers claimed high heels do not seem to objectify and sexualize women. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThese findings indicate that high heels do not signal any personality traits, or cues to health or intelligence,\u201d the report read. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cSexualized women are perceived to be less mentally capable, less competent and less deserving of moral status,\u201d researchers explained. \u201cThese decreases were not found in the current study, which leads us to conclude that high heels are not sexualized as compared to other forms of sexy or revealing clothing.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>The study concluded that the increased perception of attractiveness might have to do with changing the wearer\u2019s lumbar (spinal) curve, which gives their breast and buttocks a lift to appear perkier.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>High heels might be a step above the rest.
