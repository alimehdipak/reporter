Junior Naomi Rogge scored the game winner for the Bulldogs at the 18:15 mark of the second overtime frame. Emma Soderberg made 46 saves in net to secure the victory.<\/p>\n<p>Ohio State took down No. 5 Yale 2-1 in Friday&#8217;s second semifinal, which was delayed over an hour by the Minnesota-Duluth vs. Northeastern game going to double-overtime. The Buckeyes had never earned the top seed in the tournament and have now advanced to the program&#8217;s first national championship game.<\/p>\n<p>Friday was the first-ever Frozen Four appearance for Yale, following a 2-1 overtime victory against No. 4 Colgate in the quarterfinals.<\/p>\n<p>After a scoreless first period between Ohio State and Yale, the teams traded goals in the second. Bulldogs defender Tabea Botthof made it 1-0, followed shortly by Ohio State&#8217;s Paetyn Levin tying the game. Buckeyes winger Jennifer Gardiner made it 2-1 from there. The junior forward had four game-winning goals for Ohio State in the regular season.<\/p>\n<p>The Buckeyes ranked No. 1 in offense this season, averaging 4.7 goals per game. Yale&#8217;s defense had been its bread and butter, averaging a second-best 1.51 goals-against average.<\/p>\n<p>Friday&#8217;s first semifinal marked the second time UMD had toppled a higher-seed program in this year&#8217;s bracket. UMD previously defeated Harvard 4-0 in the tournament&#8217;s first round, and pulled the upset over No. 2 Minnesota with a 2-1 quarterfinal victory to reach the semis.<\/p>\n<p>Minnesota-Duluth heads to its first title game appearance since 2010.<\/p>\n<p>The matchup between UMD and Northeastern was familiar for both sides. They faced each other in last season&#8217;s semifinal, and that game required overtime as well. It was Northeastern coming out on top then, and the Huskies were in control of this year&#8217;s game early on as well.<\/p>\n<p>Northeastern&#8217;s freshman winger Skylar Irving opened scoring in the second period, putting the Huskies up on a rebound chance offered by Aerin Frankel. That was Irving&#8217;s second of the tournament, after she potted one against Wisconsin in the quarters.<\/p>\n<p>That goal stood until midway through the third period, when the Huskies struggled to clear the zone and UMD senior forward Taylor Anderson capitalized to tie the game at 1.<\/p>\n<p>From there, it was all about the goaltending. Frankel made a key stop on UMD&#8217;s Gabby Hughes with seconds remaining in the first overtime to get the Huskies through, and Soderberg was excellent again holding down the Bulldogs&#8217; crease on their run to the national championship.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The women&#8217;s Frozen Four national championship game is set, with No. 1 Ohio State taking on Minnesota-Duluth on Sunday at 4 p.m. ET.UMD upset No. 3 Northeastern in Friday&#8217;s first semifinal, downing the Huskies 2-1 in double-overtime.
