Yet the word \u201cmafia\u201d isn\u2019t said once in the nearly-three hour long film. That wasn\u2019t by accident. <\/p>\n<p>The omission of the word was just one of a host of concessions that the film\u2019s producers had to make to the actual mafia in order to get the movie made. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cHow these two titanic forces came together is one of the most astounding stories in the annals of film,\u201d writes author Mark Seal in his book \u201cLeave the Gun, Take the Cannoli.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>That story has been spun into a new scripted series, \u201cThe Offer,\u201d premiering Thursday on<br \/>Paramount+. It tells the story of the making of \u201cThe Godfather\u201d from the perspective<br \/>of the film\u2019s producer, Al Ruddy, a former Rand Corporation computer programmer who found success in Hollywood after successfully pitching the idea for the show \u201cHogan\u2019s Heroes.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI spent about two to three weeks interviewing Al Ruddy,\u201d said Michael Tolkin, creator and writer of the series. \u201cBasically his story was the research.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/the-offer-01.jpg?w=1024\" \/>The new Paramount+ series \u201cThe Offer\u201d (above) tells the tale of how \u201cThe Godfather\u201d was made.PARAMOUNT+    <\/p>\n<p>Joe Colombo was the leader of the Colombo crime family, one of the \u201cFive Families\u201d of the New York mob in the early 1970s. He was also the head of the Italian American Civil Rights League, which campaigned against Italian American stereotyping, and particularly against the use of the word \u201cmafia.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>The League\u2019s influence was so powerful, they convinced the Justice Department and the New York State Police to stop using the word \u201cmafia\u201d in press releases. They mobilized tens of thousands of people to rallies and marches in New York City. And they organized a benefit concert at Madison Square Garden with Frank Sinatra to raise over a half million dollars, all of which, according to Ruddy, was used to try to stop the production of \u201cThe Godfather.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>In \u201cThe Offer,\u201d Colombo and the League\u2019s antagonism of the film comes at the request of Frank Sinatra himself, who believes the character Johnny Fontane is based on him. In fact, Sinatra did famously confront Mario Puzo, the author of the bestselling 1969 book the film was based on, at Chasen\u2019s restaurant in Los Angeles, where he called Puzo a pimp and threatened to \u201cbeat the hell out of him.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/frank-sinatra.jpg?w=682\" \/>In \u201cThe Offer,\u201d Colombo and the Italian American Civil Rights League\u2019s antagonism of the film comes at the request of Frank Sinatra himself, who believes the character Johnny Fontane is based on him.Alamy    <\/p>\n<p>Puzo denied that Fontane was based on Sinatra, but well before the publication of the novel, Sinatra had plenty of other reasons to put Puzo in his crosshairs. <\/p>\n<p>The author had written a critical essay about Sinatra and the Italian American Civil Rights League in the New York Times Magazine, arguing that it was ridiculous to claim that organized crime in America wasn\u2019t controlled by Italian Americans. He also described the League\u2019s activism as \u201csheer madness\u201d and compared Sinatra to a mafia leader. <\/p>\n<p>Sinatra was roiled for years by rumors that his friendship to gangsters like Chicago mob boss Sam Giancana linked him to the mafia. Many of these rumors closely mirror events from \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d such as Vito Corleone convincing a band leader to let Johnny Fontane out of his contract by \u201cmaking him an offer he couldn\u2019t refuse\u201d \u2014 a similar story has been told about Sinatra and big-band leader Tommy Dorsey. There is also the scene where a movie producer find a horse\u2019s head in his bed, as a way to pressure him to cast Johnny Fontane in a war movie; Sinatra\u2019s big break in Hollywood came from his role in \u201cFrom Here to Eternity\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Puzo has admitted he took inspiration from the Dorsey story, but he also claimed he knew very little about the mob before writing the book, and based it all on research rather than real life experience.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/al-ruddy-1.jpg?w=682\" alt=\"Before making peace with the Italian-American community \u2014 including the Colombo crime family \u2014 producer Al Ruddy received death threats and was warned by authorities that he was being followed. \" \/>Before making peace with the Italian-American community \u2014\u00a0including the Colombo crime family \u2014 producer Al Ruddy received death threats and was warned by authorities that he was being followed. Bettmann Archive    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI never met a real honest-to-god-gangster,\u201d he wrote in his 1972 autobiography \u201cThe Godfather Papers and Other Confessions.\u201d He even based the character of Vito Corleone, played in the film by Marlon Brando, on his mother. The result was a story that was more fantasy than fact. <\/p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019The Godfather\u2019 elevated the mob to the level of myth,\u201d Seal told The Post, \u201clifting it above the grim realities by telling the story of not merely their crimes but their families.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Still, the League fought the production publicly, and the mob fought the production behind the scenes. <\/p>\n<p>The film was denounced by New York Congressman Mario Biaggi. Petitions circulated through the Italian American community urging a boycott of the film, and many businesses and homeowners in the New York City Italian neighborhoods where the movie was largely filmed, refused to allow the filmmakers to shoot on their property. The Teamsters threatened to stop all transportation and deliveries for the production.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/marlon-brando-the-godfather-02.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Author Mario Puzo says he based the character of Vito Corleone, played in the film by Marlon Brando, on his mother.\" \/>Author Mario Puzo says he based the character of Vito Corleone, played in the film by Marlon Brando, on his mother.Everett Collection    <\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Ruddy and Robert Evans, the head of Paramount Pictures, received death threats, Ruddy was warned by law enforcement he was being followed, and Betty McCartt, Ruddy\u2019s assistant, had her car windshield shot out. The perpetrators left a note saying they didn\u2019t want the film to be made.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually Ruddy met privately with Colombo and struck a deal: Ruddy would remove all mentions of the words \u201cmafia\u201d and \u201cla cosa nostra\u201d from the script; he would give jobs and parts in the film to League members; and Paramount would donate the proceeds from the premier to the League. <\/p>\n<p>While Ruddy never made good on the last promise, the other two were easy. For. one thing, the word \u201cmafia\u201d only appeared in the script once, so it was easy to get rid of. And the producers and the director were more than happy to invite more Italian Americans, especially ones who understood the mafia, to participate in the production.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn the making of \u2018The Godfather,\u2019 the worlds of the moviemakers and the mob certainly crossed paths,\u201d said Seal, \u201cand the movie is all the better for that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/marlon-brando-lenny-montana.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Real-life Colombo family soldier Lenny Montana (right) was cast in the role of fictional Corleone family hitman Luca Brasi.\" \/>Real-life Colombo family soldier Lenny Montana (right) was cast in the role of fictional Corleone family hitman Luca Brasi.Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>The actors benefitted from having mob guys like Carmine \u201cthe Snake\u201d Persico and Andrew \u201cMush\u201d Russo on set to school them in the culture and traditions of the underworld. Although the decision to cast real-life Colombo family soldier Lenny Montana in the role of fictional Corleone family hitman Luca Brasi may not have been the wisest.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAfter Lenny Montana had been cast as Luca Brasi, he was hired by a certain mobster to beat up Al Ruddy,\u201d said \u201cThe Offer\u201d showrunner Nikki Toscano. Montana showed up at Ruddy\u2019s doorstep and attacked him, leaving him beaten and bloodied, then showed up for filming the next day. <\/p>\n<p>All was forgiven, however, and Montana filmed one of the most iconic scenes of the movie, where he\u2019s the one beaten and bloodied. Art imitates life, it seems.<\/p>\n<p>After Ruddy\u2019s deal with Colombo became public, Ruddy was fired from the movie. \u201cColombo put Al in a compromising position,\u201d says Tolkin, \u201cand that really was a crisis.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/joseph-russo.jpg?w=682\" alt=\"The actors benefitted from having mob guy Andrew \u201cMush\u201d Russo on set to school them in the culture and traditions of the underworld.\" \/>The actors benefitted from having mob guy Andrew \u201cMush\u201d Russo on set to school them in the culture and traditions of the underworld.Spencer Burnett    <\/p>\n<p>Ironically, Colombo and the League again organized the unions and the Italian American community again \u2014 only this time to get Ruddy reinstated. It worked, and Ruddy was put back on the film. <\/p>\n<p>It also cemented an unusual bond between Ruddy and Colombo, one that is explored in depth in \u201cThe Offer.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTo have a producer develop such a personal relationship with the guy who was one of the heads of the Five Families is what drew me to the project in the first place,\u201d said Toscano.<\/p>\n<p>Ruddy\u2019s friendship with Colombo helped grease the wheels for the production. League captains visited local residents and urged them to cooperate with the crew. When a homeowner in Staten Island refused to allow the film to shoot on their property, Ruddy called Colombo, who intimidated the homeowner into changing their mind, according to Seal\u2019s book.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/joe-colombo-sr-01.jpg?w=682\" \/>Colombo family crime boss Joe Colombo (center) first tried to stop production on the \u201cThe Godftaher\u201d \u2014\u00a0then turned over and helped it get made.AP    <\/p>\n<p>Ruddy defended his deal with the mob in a 1972 interview in Ladies Home Journal by saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone would have been physically hurt. But the picture simply could not have been made without their approval.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>There wasn\u2019t a happy ending for Ruddy, though. Sixty six days into filming \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d Joe Colombo was gunned down during a League rally in Columbus Circle. He survived the shooting, but was paralyzed and in a partial coma for the next seven years until he died from cardiac arrest. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Godfather\u201d was released while Colombo was still in the hospital, but Al Ruddy kept a promise he made to Colombo to make sure \u201cthe boys\u201d would be able to attend the premier. When Paramount refused to allow the mobsters involved in the production to attend, Ruddy snuck out a print of the film and held a private screening for them. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere must have been a hundred limousines out front,\u201d Ruddy told Seal. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/Francis-Ford-Coppola-oscars-07.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Director Francis Ford Coppola accepted one of the film's three Academy Awards including Best Picture.\" \/>Director Francis Ford Coppola accepted one of the film\u2019s three Academy Awards, including Best Picture.AP    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Godfather\u201d broke box office records, won three Academy Awards including Best Picture, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made.<\/p>\n<p>The fictional Corleone family, who was never based on actual mobsters, has become the cultural archetype for a mafia family; so much so that mafia members today look to the film for inspiration, rather than the other way around. <\/p>\n<p>When Jeffery Godlberg interviewed Sammy \u201cthe Bull\u201d Gravano for the New York Times in 2000, he asked him if \u201cThe Godfather\u201d had any influence on the notorious mafia hitman\u2019s life. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I killed 19 people,\u201d Gravano said, <\/p>\n<p>When Goldberg asked Gravano what that had to do with \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d Gravano replied \u201dI only did, like, one murder before I saw the movie.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cThe Godfather,\u201d which turns 50 this year, is easily the most famous mafia movie of all time.
