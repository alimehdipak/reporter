At the Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 W 65th Street.<\/p>\n<p>The set is the real star of \u201cThe Skin of Our Teeth,\u201d Thornton Wilder\u2019s geezer of a play that opened Monday night on Broadway.<\/p>\n<p>Up at Lincoln Center\u2019s Vivian Beaumont Theater, designer Adam Rigg\u2019s spectacular scenery for the revival is as mammoth as the woolly mammoth that stomps around the characters\u2019 living room along with an adorable brachiosaurus. The supersize environs liven up a 1942 comedy that, at over three hours long, can feel rather prehistoric itself.<\/p>\n<p>In three sporadically funny acts, Wilder\u2019s Antrobus family glibly lives through the history of the planet \u2014 both scientific and biblical: the Mesozoic Era, the Ice Age, the Garden of Eden, Noah\u2019s Ark and a couple of World Wars. It\u2019s a comedy for a PhD.<\/p>\n<p>Even with a pinky-out \u201cI won a Pulitzer\u201d attitude, the show can be amusing in spots. Lileana Blain-Cruz\u2019s energetic staging is reminiscent of the Marvel miniseries \u201cWandaVision,\u201d in that the same nuclear family of characters \u2014 a husband and wife, two kids and a scheming maid \u2014 experience different eras in sitcom style. Each act is prefaced by a \u201cNews of the World\u201d TV segment. And the mysterious housekeeper, Sabina (Gabby Beans), is Agatha all along.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The first act takes place in a \u201cLeave It To Beaver\u201d-esque living room (even though it\u2019s set a few thousand years before then) and the father (James Vincent Meredith) has just invented the wheel and the lever. The family and their neighbors attempt to protect themselves from the oncoming ice age.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/skin-of-our-teeth-broadway-2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"A woolly mammoth stomps around the Antrobus family's New Jersey home. \" \/>A brachiosaurus and woolly mammoth stomp around the Antrobus family\u2019s New Jersey home. Julieta Cervantes    <\/p>\n<p>The second act \u2014 the weirdest and most immobile \u2014 is a convention of mammals on the Atlantic City, New Jersey, boardwalk, the denizens of which behave like Sodom and Gomorrah (there is a giant slide!). Borrowing a page from a motel room drawer, the world is flooded at the end.<\/p>\n<p>And then the third section returns to the suburban home, which has been scorched by war, and is the kind of room where Samuel Beckett would want to sit and silently brood. Sans jokes, and pushing 11 p.m., the production loses steam here.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Skin of Our Teeth\u201d is trotted out every so often by theaters that wish to inform us that the writer of \u201cOur Town\u201d also wrote other plays, like Shakespeare festivals and \u201cThe Two Noble Kinsmen.\u201d The points Wilder makes \u2014 that family life is a universal constant and that peaceful periods are inevitably followed by some natural disaster or geopolitical strife \u2014 are roughly the same as those of \u201cOur Town,\u201d only less emotionally true and more self-indulgent and pretentious.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/skin-of-our-teeth-broadway-6.jpg?w=1024\" \/>\u201cThe Skin of Our Teeth\u201d takes a serious war-torn turn in Act 3. Julieta Cervantes    <\/p>\n<p>Those loyal Lincoln Center subscribers have their microscopes out in search of any speck of profundity in the show \u2014 but, beyond the obvious, there isn\u2019t much to spot. This staging tries to add in some modern meaning with new text. The excellent playwright Branden Jacobs Jenkins contributed material.<\/p>\n<p>Beans, who brings to mind Endora from \u201cBewitched,\u201d begins a smidge too campy, but turns out one of the season\u2019s funnier performances. Meredith and Roslyn Ruff, as Mr. and Mrs. Antrobus, ground the zaniness with moral authority. And, playing the Antrobus\u2019 son, Henry, Julian Robertson\u2019s PTSD-inflected performance in Act 3 is affecting.<\/p>\n<p>But golly, this set. \u201cOur Town,\u201d with its ladders and chairs, looks like a very poor cousin, indeed.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Theater review Three hours with two intermissions.
