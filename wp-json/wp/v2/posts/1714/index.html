The layout, appliances, and colors all play a role in creating a functional and attractive space. Here are some tips for redesigning your kitchen:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h2><b> Install a pullout pantry.<\/b><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Pantries with pull-out shelves are fantastic because it allows you to save space by looking at everything from a higher vantage point without having to shuffle items around or strain your knees and back. They are also great for storing your appliances like blenders, IntantPot, slow cookers, etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h2><b> Place your microwave at or below counter height.<\/b><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For your back and shoulders, it is more comfortable to have your microwave on the counter. Since heavy items can be rested below you, spills are less likely when removing hot food from the microwave. If you have the space, consider creating a base cabinet for the microwave so that it can be at counter height or below.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h2><b> Make corner cabinets accessible.<\/b><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To minimize any pain for people with back problems, consider corner cabinets that have enough storage to store many items. But when adding a corner cabinet, it\u2019s also important to take into consideration that the cabinet must include a lazy Susan (a drawer or shelf) and be as easy to use as possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<h2><b> Pick drawers over doors.<\/b><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Drawers allow you to see all your items in one place, eliminating the need to get on your knees and peer into your cabinet. Drawers make it easy to remove an item from your bottom cabinet or slide them out a bit. The traditional hanging doors won&#8217;t add any useful space that&#8217;ll make this option better since they take up space, as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>\n<h2><b> Keep the sink close to the stove.<\/b><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We can give you a layout plan for your kitchen, but it&#8217;s helpful to have an idea in mind of where to put the important appliances. Ideally, keep your stove near your sink, with a workspace in between. Since our bodies change with age, it&#8217;s hard to carry heavy pots full of water back and forth. If there are spills on the way, you&#8217;ll have a slip hazard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When looking for remodeling ideas for your <a href=\"https:\/\/kbizzalex.wixsite.com\/buzz\/post\/home-construction-remodeling-in-magnolia-texas\">kitchen<\/a>, take advantage of our expertise.
