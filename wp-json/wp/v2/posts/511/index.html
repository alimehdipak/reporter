Per NPD, women are increasingly trading in their waist cinchers and bodysuits for more easygoing tank tops and thongs.<\/p>\n<p>And when they do dress up, women of all sizes are more likely to accentuate their natural shapes, donning pieces with plunging necklines and drastic cutouts or made of yards of sheer fabric. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/Elizabeth-Olsen.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=682\" alt=\"Elizabeth Olsen, 33, was a vision of classic Hollywood glamour in her low cut maroon dress. \" \/>Elizabeth Olsen, 33, was a vision of classic Hollywood glamour in her low-cut maroon dress.
