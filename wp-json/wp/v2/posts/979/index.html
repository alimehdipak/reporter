That&#8217;s $80 million more than the previous NFL record for fully guaranteed money at signing.<\/p>\n<p>Now, the Ravens are looking to negotiate a contract extension with Jackson, who is entering his fifth-year option.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to answer that when I had a reaction to it. And it&#8217;s like, &#8216;Damn, I wish they hadn&#8217;t guaranteed the whole contract,'&#8221; Bisciotti said Tuesday at the NFL league meetings. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know that he should&#8217;ve been the first guy to get a fully guaranteed contract. To me, that&#8217;s something that is groundbreaking, and it&#8217;ll make negotiations harder with others.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p>Bisciotti then added, &#8220;But it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that we have to play that game, you know? We shall see. If I was in bogged-down negotiations with Lamar, then maybe I would have a quicker reaction to that news.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta previously said this offseason that the team has reached out to start contract talks with Jackson. But Jackson hasn&#8217;t shown any urgency to get a deal done.<\/p>\n<p>If the sides can&#8217;t reach a new contract by next offseason, the Ravens would have to place a franchise tag on him to keep him from becoming a free agent.<\/p>\n<p>Bisciotti called Jackson&#8217;s decision to wait &#8220;unique as hell because everybody expects you to say, &#8216;I&#8217;ve got to get mine now.'&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The kid is so obsessed with winning a Super Bowl, that I think deep down, he doesn&#8217;t think he&#8217;s worthy,&#8221; Bisciotti said in his first interview with reporters in four years. &#8220;I think he wants that to say, &#8216;Now, I deserve to be on top.&#8217; People can speculate any way they want. I don&#8217;t think he is turned on by money that much and he knows it&#8217;s coming one way or the other.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Bisciotti doesn&#8217;t foresee Baltimore signing Jackson to a contract extension before the start of the season &#8220;unless he has a change of heart and calls Eric and says, &#8216;I&#8217;m ready.'&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s like, Eric can&#8217;t keep calling him and say, &#8216;Hey Lamar, you really need to get in here and get this thing done.&#8217; That&#8217;s not a GM&#8217;s job,&#8221; Bisciotti said. &#8220;Kirk Cousins did it that way. What if Lamar says that? I&#8217;ll play on the fifth year, I&#8217;ll play on the franchise, I&#8217;ll play on another franchise and then you can sign me.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And that gives me three years to win the Super Bowl so you can make me a $60 million quarterback, because that&#8217;s where it will be four years from now. That might be the case, but I don&#8217;t talk to Lamar. It&#8217;s not my role. I don&#8217;t know the answer.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>PALM BEACH, Fla. &#8212; Baltimore Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti acknowledged Tuesday that Deshaun Watson&#8217;s record-setting contract could have ripple effects for quarterback deals going forward, including the one for Lamar Jackson.On March 18, Watson received a five-year, $230 million fully guaranteed contract from the Cleveland Browns after getting traded by the Houston Texans.
