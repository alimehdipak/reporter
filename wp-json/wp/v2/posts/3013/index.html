And then there was Ann Getty, the red-haired society swan who passed away at 79 in 2020. Married to oil heir Gordon Getty, she was aunt to trans model Nats Getty, grandmother (practically mother) to Ivy Getty, and daughter-in-law to tycoon J. Paul Getty, whose oil empire funded the family\u2019s massive fortune. She was also a fashion trendsetter.<\/p>\n<p>Ann had a famously cavalier way with her gems, wearing earrings as brooches and brooches all over her body, including at her hip. Now her collection of prized gems \u2014 created by jeweler Joel Arthur Rosenthal, aka JAR \u2014 are headed for auction at Christie\u2019s New York on June 8.<\/p>\n<p>Famously elusive and exclusive, Rosenthal insisted on personally vetting and approving each client before agreeing to sell to them. \u201cThe privilege of being able to buy Rosenthal\u2019s pieces is about having a bank account and discernment,\u201d said a source close to the Getty family. \u201cIf he didn\u2019t want you to have his piece, he would refuse to sell to you. He wanted to sell to clients who understood what he was doing.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"663\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/ann-getty-1985.jpg?w=663\" alt=\"Ann Getty\" \/>Back in the 1980s, Ann Getty was at the center of the social scene, from her home base in San Francisco to New York.

Drew Altizer Photography    <\/p>\n<p>Money and status helped with this \u201cunderstanding,\u201d but did not guarantee access. Ann \u2014 who sat on the boards of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the\u00a0New York Public Library \u2014 proved her worth by giving her JAR pieces the starring role in many of her outfits.<\/p>\n<p>To her husband\u2019s 76th birthday gala, she donned a red gown with three JAR Fleur Pompons brooches clipped to her breast. To the 2017 San Francisco Symphony, she rocked an enormous pink tulip brooch at her sternum, and to Gordon\u2019s 80th birthday bash at Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco, she fastened her circa 1989 leaf brooch to the shoulder of her blouse.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnn\u2019s style was bold, unapologetic, sophisticated, creative, and daring,\u201d Anna Getty, Ann\u2019s great-niece, told The Post. \u201c[Her style] was utterly her own.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>     \t  \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"589\" height=\"589\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/JAR-AGATE-DIAMOND-AND-SAPPHIRE-ZEBRA-BROOCH.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=589\" alt=\"A carved agate zebra brooch with diamonds and sapphires is expected to sell for between $50,000-70,000.\" \/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA carved agate zebra brooch with diamonds and sapphires is expected to sell for between $50,000-70,000. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChristie&#8217;s Images Limited 2022 \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"589\" height=\"589\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/JAR-COLORED-SAPPHIRE-AND-SPINEL-SHELL-BROOCH.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=589\" alt=\"A colored sapphire and spinel shell-shaped brooch from 1990 is worth up to $120,000.\" \/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA colored sapphire and spinel shell-shaped brooch from 1990 is worth up to $120,000.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChristie&#8217;s Images Limited 2022 \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"589\" height=\"589\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/JAR-MULTI-GEM-AND-DIAMOND-VITRAIL-FLEUR-DE-LYS-BROOCH.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=589\" alt=\"The Vitrail Fleur-de-Lys brooch is made with polished amethysts, pink tourmalines, garnets and round diamonds, and is expected to sell for anywhere between $80,000-$120,000.\" \/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Vitrail Fleur-de-Lys brooch is made with polished amethysts, pink tourmalines, garnets and round diamonds, and is expected to sell for anywhere between $80,000-$120,000.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChristie&#8217;s Images Limited 2022 \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"589\" height=\"589\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/JAR-MULTI-GEM-AND-DIAMOND-LEAF-BROOCH.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=589\" alt=\"The leaf brooch is decorated with 11.96 carats of emeralds, beryls, peridots, garnets, tourmalines and diamonds, and could go for as much as $700,000.\" \/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe leaf brooch is decorated with 11.96 carats of emeralds, beryls, peridots, garnets, tourmalines and diamonds, and could go for as much as $700,000.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChristie&#8217;s Images Limited 2022 \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t     <\/p>\n<p>Throughout much of the late 1980s and early 1990s, Ann purchased 12 pieces from JAR, a collection which is expected to fetch more than $1.5 million at auction, with proceeds going to the Ann Getty Trust.<\/p>\n<p>Ann\u2019s granddaughter Ivy, 27, who married her photographer boyfriend in an\u00a0over-the-top three day extravaganza\u00a0last year,has sported several of the pieces herself recently.
