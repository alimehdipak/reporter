Stroke and heart attack are life-threatening complications of heart disease. CDC data shows that in 2016, more than 640,000 people died from heart diseases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most heart diseases can be prevented, which is a positive thing. You can also manage your risk of heart disease with lifestyle changes if you already have it. Healthy eating, regular exercise, and other self-care habits can significantly reduce the risk of heart disease and major complications. Today, make these five changes and see results tomorrow.<\/p>\n\n<h2>1. Eat a healthy, balanced diet of whole foods<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the old saying says, you are what you eat. So make sure to stay away from processed foods, high-fat foods, and high-cholesterol foods. Make your diet high in fiber and low in salt. Eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as lean proteins such as chicken and fish. Reduce the amount of added sugar you consume as well to help manage your blood sugar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Maintain a healthy body weight<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You are more likely to suffer from several health conditions if you are overweight or obese, including hormonal imbalances, metabolic diseases, and heart disease. When these numbers are high, you&#8217;re at a much higher risk of developing heart disease. Losing just 5-10% of your body weight can help improve your blood pressure and blood cholesterol.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Be more active<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintaining a healthy weight and heart is easy with physical activity. Exercise for about 30 minutes every day. You can ride a bicycle or take your dog for a brisk walk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may sound like a lot, but you don\u2019t have to exercise for prolonged periods at a time. Just take a few minutes every day to do some exercise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Quit smoking and limit alcohol consumption<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Blood pressure is raised when you drink too much alcohol. The risk of heart disease increases when you smoke. To prevent these health complications, women should limit themselves to just one beverage per day and men to two per day.

Learn to manage stress<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Today&#8217;s stressful lifestyle is one factor that contributes to chronic disease such as heart disease, hypertension, and obesity. Manage stress and protect your heart health by engaging in relaxing activities like yoga or deep breathing.
