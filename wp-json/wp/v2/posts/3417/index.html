The 23-year-old Italy international has enjoyed a meteoric rise with the <i>Nerazzurri<\/i>, first under Antonio Conte and now with Simone Inzaghi in the dugout, and Inter demanding a transfer fee of \u20ac60m to sanction Bastoni&#8217;s departure could prove to be a bargain too good to pass up for the Red Devils.<\/p>\n<p><b>18.04 BST:<\/b> While it&#8217;s been reported for some time that Juventus forward and pending free agent <b>Paulo Dybala<\/b> would join Inter Milan this summer, Corriere dello Sport reports that the <i>Nerazzurri<\/i> have pressed pause on that move as a return of <b>Romelu Lukaku<\/b> becomes increasingly possible.

Sources told ESPN that De Jong would have to be persuaded to join United, particularly after they dropped out of the Champions League, but a move has not been ruled out.<\/p>\n<p>Intermediaries working on behalf of Barcelona have tried to find potential suitors for the 25-year-old, and although Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich have asked to be kept informed, United&#8217;s interest is the strongest. Sources told ESPN that Manchester City are distancing themselves from De Jong, instead choosing to focus on Leeds United&#8217;s Kalvin Phillips as a replacement for Fernandinho, who will leave the club this summer.<\/p>\n<p>United have also registered interest in Phillips, but sources said he would be reluctant to move to Old Trafford given Leeds&#8217; intense rivalry with United.<\/p>\n<p>Barcelona are already looking for replacements for De Jong, whose transfer fee is said to be around \u00a375 million. United are unlikely to meet those terms and would have to seek to agree a lower fee, but there is a belief Barcelona&#8217;s financial situation could leave room for compromise.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Daily Star reports that United are willing to make De Jong the club&#8217;s highest-paid player in order to tempt him to come to Old Trafford. The club will reportedly offer him a \u00a3395,000-a-week deal, which is more than the club&#8217;s current top earner, David de gea, and forward Cristiano Ronaldo.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/espnmediazone.com\/us\/files\/2018\/03\/App-Icon-Android-7.png&amp;w=126&amp;site=espnfc\" width=\"30\" \/>16.10 BST: Gareth Bale and Angel Di Maria have both been offered to Atletico Madrid as potential free transfers this summer, sources have confirmed to ESPN&#8217;s Alex Kirkland and Rodrigo Faez, but the LaLiga club have turned down the chance to sign either player.<\/p>\n<p>Bale, 32, will leave Real Madrid after nine years at the club when his contract expires in June, while Di Maria, 34, is leaving Paris Saint-Germain when his deal runs out.<\/p>\n<p>The Spanish radio station COPE first reported on Monday that Bale&#8217;s representatives had offered him to Atletico, saying the discussion had taken place in a meeting with the club&#8217;s sporting director Andrea Berta. Sources told ESPN that Atletico appreciated the offer but felt the finances involved in such a deal would make it difficult to justify, given Bale&#8217;s age. If they were to strengthen their attack, they would prefer to focus their efforts on a player who could contribute to the team over a longer period of time.<\/p>\n<p>Bale did not feature in Real Madrid&#8217;s Champions League final win over Liverpool in Paris on Saturday after an injury-disrupted season. Sources close to the player told ESPN that no decisions would be taken on his future until after he had featured for Wales in their June matches, which include a World Cup qualifying playoff final against Scotland or Ukraine. Bale and his family have been happy living in Madrid despite his reduced role in the team in recent years, and his family remained in the Spanish capital during his 2020-21 loan at Tottenham.<\/p>\n<p>Atletico have also been offered Di Maria, who played his final game for PSG last weekend, starting and scoring in a 5-0 win over Metz at the Parc des Princes. He has played 295 games for the Ligue 1 club since signing from Manchester United in 2015, scoring 92 goals.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m calm. There&#8217;s time, I have to think,&#8221; he told ESPN on Saturday. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t just my decision, I&#8217;ll always think about my family and then about me.

They finished sixth, with their lowest points tally in the Premier League era, and failed to qualify for next season&#8217;s Champions League.<\/p>\n<p>A statement from the Premier League club said: &#8220;We would like to thank Ralf Rangnick for his efforts as interim manager over the past six months.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;By mutual agreement, Ralf will now focus solely on his new role as manager of the Austria national team and will not therefore be taking up a consultancy role at Old Trafford.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We would like to wish Ralf the best of luck in this next chapter of his career.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Rangnick was set to remain at United in a consultancy role to help new coach Erik ten Hag.<\/p>\n<p>14.35 BST: Manchester United are interested in signing N&#8217;Golo Kante from Chelsea, according to the Guardian.<\/p>\n<p>Midfielder Kante&#8217;s contract expires next year and with United keen to strengthen their midfield this summer, new boss Erik ten Haag will test Chelsea see if they&#8217;re willing to negotiate.<\/p>\n<p>Kante remains a key player for Thomas Tuchel however, and the German boss has made no secret of wanting to continue working with the 31-year-old World Cup winner.<\/p>\n<p>Kante has experienced injury problems this season, which could be one reason the Blues might consider letting him leave. Tuchel has admitted his frustration at not always having Kante available due to injuries, but it would be a brave move for new Blues owner Todd Boehly to allow such a quality player join a major rival.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/espnmediazone.com\/us\/files\/2018\/03\/App-Icon-Android-7.png&amp;w=126&amp;site=espnfc\" width=\"30\" \/>13.44 BST: Paris Saint-Germain have made Neymar available for transfer this summer, sources told ESPN&#8217;s Julien Laurens, with the club seeking a new direction following Kylian Mbappe&#8217;s surprise contract extension.<\/p>\n<p>PSG&#8217;s stance marks another U-turn at the club, following on from Mbappe&#8217;s decision to stay when he looked certain to leave on a free transfer. Neymar signed a new contract at the club last year and it has three years to run, but PSG are hoping to offload him this summer.<\/p>\n<p>Mbappe&#8217;s new deal, which runs until 2025, marks a new era for the club, with sporting director Leonardo expected to leave his position soon, to be replaced by Luis Campos &#8212; an Mbappe ally, following their successful spell at Monaco together.<\/p>\n<p>Campos was at Monaco when Mbappe burst onto the scene and won the Ligue 1 title in 2017, as well as reaching the Champions League semifinals. The 57-year-old has a reputation for unearthing top talent and securing large transfer fees for hidden gems, with Mbappe one of many notable successes. Campos joined Monaco in 2013, and four years later, the club had won their first title in 17 years. He will be officially announced as PSG&#8217;s new director in the coming days but is already at work shaping the squad, according to sources, with a focus on younger players.<\/p>\n<p>Neymar, 30, has been in Qatar with some of PSG&#8217;s sponsors and said this week that he wants to stay at PSG, but the Ligue 1 champions want to generate transfer funds to shape their squad. The Brazil international joined PSG for a world record \u20ac222m from Barcelona in 2017 but has featured in only 50% of the club&#8217;s matches since joining, amid a recurring run of injuries.<\/p>\n<p>Neymar&#8217;s sizable salary, which costs PSG around \u20ac35m a year, may prove a stumbling block in the event of any interested clubs coming forward to make an offer, but Chelsea have a long-standing interest in the forward.<\/p>\n<p>12.57 BST: Liverpool defender Nat Phillips could be joining one of the Premier League&#8217;s newly promoted sides for next season, according to The Sun.<\/p>\n<p>Phillips, 21, spend the second half of the 2021-22 season on loan at Bournemouth, helping them secure their return to the top flight. The Cherries now want to make his stay at the club permanent.<\/p>\n<p>However, Fulham are also interested in signing the Wales international to boost their own hopes of Premier League survival beyond the 2022-23 campaign.<\/p>\n<p>The Sun reports that Liverpool will seek a \u00a315m fee for Phillips.<\/p>\n<p>12.11 BST: Erik ten Hag has prioritised the signings of Ajax defender Jurrien Timber and Benfica striker Darwin Nunez, the Daily Mirror reports.<\/p>\n<p>Timber, 20, was part of Ten Hag&#8217;s Ajax team which won the 2021-22 Eredivisie title, and the Netherlands international has been identified as the player to bolster United&#8217;s options at centre-back. The Mirror reports that Ajax could be willing to make a transfer happen for a fee of around \u00a335m.<\/p>\n<p>Ten hag also wants United chiefs John Murtough and Darren Fletcher to push for the signing of Nunez. The Uruguay international has established himself as one of the most promising young strikers in Europe this season, but Benfica are likely to want at least \u00a380m for a player who scored 32 goals in 40 games for club and country this term.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/espnmediazone.com\/us\/files\/2018\/03\/App-Icon-Android-7.png&amp;w=126&amp;site=espnfc\" width=\"30\" \/>11.22 BST: Barcelona will tell more than 10 players that they are free to leave the club this summer as Xavi Hernandez plans to overhaul the squad following a trophyless season at Camp Nou, sources told ESPN&#8217;s Sam Marsden and Moises Llorens.<\/p>\n<p>However, sources add it will not be easy to relocate many of the unwanted players due to their reluctance to leave and their high salaries.<\/p>\n<p>Xavi has already confirmed conversations with Riqui Puig, Oscar Mingueza, Martin Braithwaite and Samuel Umtiti in which he informed them they are not part of his long-term plans. Clement Lenglet, Ferran Jutgla, loanees Luuk de Jong and Adama Traore and those returning from loans elsewhere, such as Francisco Trincao and Miralem Pjanic, are also likely to be invited to leave.<\/p>\n<p>There is also uncertainty surrounding the futures of Ousmane Dembele and Dani Alves, who are both out of contract next month, while sources add that Barca&#8217;s financial situation could force them to listen to big offers for Memphis Depay and Frenkie de Jong.<\/p>\n<p>Despite Barca&#8217;s desire to ring the changes, though, they are already encountering hurdles. Both Braithwaite and Pjanic have spoken of their desire to fulfill the final two years of their contracts, while the high salaries earned by players like Lenglet are making finding a suitor difficult.<\/p>\n<p>10.35 BST: Marcelo will leave Real Madrid this summer, the defender confirmed after winning a record-breaking 25th trophy at the club in their 1-0 Champions League final victory over Liverpool.<\/p>\n<p>The veteran defender was an unused substitute in Madrid&#8217;s win in Paris, but lifted the trophy &#8212; his fifth Champions League, having been involved in 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018 &#8212; as club captain.<\/p>\n<p>Marcelo, 34, had said earlier this week that he wanted to stay at the Bernabeu with his contract due to expire next month, but admitted after the game that he would be leaving Madrid after 15 years.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an incredible emotion because it&#8217;s my last game at Real Madrid,&#8221; he told journalists in the mixed zone at the Stade de France. &#8220;Leaving with a Champions League is a huge joy. It isn&#8217;t a sad day.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The left-back became the most decorated player in Real Madrid&#8217;s history when he overtook legendary winger Paco Gento&#8217;s 23 trophies as the club won LaLiga last month. His trophy haul now stands at five Champions Leagues, four Club World Cups, three European Super Cups, six league titles, two Copa del Reys and five Spanish Supercopas.<\/p>\n<p>Marcelo had been widely expected to move on this summer &#8212; having lost his first-team place to Ferland Mendy in recent seasons &#8212; but said in the aftermath of Madrid&#8217;s league title celebrations that he wanted to continue.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You talk about things,&#8221; he said on Saturday. &#8220;We&#8217;ve spoken and we&#8217;ve decided it&#8217;s best like that.

Sport believes Mane will leave Liverpool and head to Bayern in a move worth \u20ac30 million. Once that&#8217;s confirmed, Bayern won&#8217;t stand in Lewandowski&#8217;s way, and the Polish 33-year-old is believed to have already agreed a deal at Camp Nou.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Leicester City are interested in Manchester United midfielder James Garner, according to the Mirror. The Foxes have been impressed by Garner&#8217;s loan spell at Nottingham Forest, with the 21-year-old playing a key part in helping Forest reach Sunday&#8217;s Championship play-off final. Garner&#8217;s long-term future at Old Trafford is unclear, with Leeds United and Southampton are also monitoring the situation.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Villarreal are hoping to make Giovani Lo Celso&#8217;s loan move to Spain a permanent one, but Tottenham Hotspur are asking for a fee of \u20ac20m, according to Fabrizio Romano. The Italian journalist says that Villarreal boss Unai Emery is desperate to keep the Argentine midfielder, who helped <i>Los Che<\/i> reach the Champions League semifinal. It&#8217;s seems that Lo Celso doesn&#8217;t appear to be in Spurs boss Antonio Conte&#8217;s plans for next season.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; West Ham United and Southampton are battling it out with Ajax Amsterdam for FC Salzburg striker Junior Adamu, according to the Daily Mail. The Austrian international, 20, who has also been targeted by Hertha Berlin and RB Leipzig, has been valued at around \u00a312m. Adamu can play as a winger or striker and he&#8217;s scored nine goals this season, including one against Bayern Munich in the Champions League. Quick and skilful, he is contracted until 2025.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Tottenham look to have succeeded in their quest to bring Internazionale&#8217;s Ivan Perisic, according to Fabrizio Romano. The Italian journalist says a two-year deal has been agreed between the two clubs, with a medical due to take place early next week before everything is signed and sealed. Tottenham had made the 33-year-old Inter midfielder a top priority, and his arrival could be key to the aforementioned Conte to extend his stay in London.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; New Burnley boss Vincent Kompany is keen to be reunited with Taylor Harwood-Bellis, according to the Sun. The former Manchester City skipper took the 21-year-old defender to Anderlecht on loan, and now he wants to make him a permanent addition at Turf Moor. Kompany is hoping his relationship with his former club will help facilitate the move, but he faces competition from Celtic and Brentford.
