The tattoo, by Hungarian artist Balazs Bercsenyi, is exceptionally detailed and full of different astrological designs.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a deep and meaningful story and connection to absolutely each element of this art piece, and I&#8217;ll share a little more about that one day,&#8221; Rodgers said in his Instagram caption.<\/p>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p>From what we can see of the design, several elements appear to relate to astrological symbols. At the top, there&#8217;s the Sagittarius zodiac sign (Rodgers himself is a Sagittarius, having been born on Dec. 2, 1983) and two lions that could call to mind the sign of Leo. A single open eye adds an aura of mystery to the whole thing, among several constellations. The signs of Aquarius and Scorpio are also present.<\/p>\n<p>This season will be Rodgers&#8217; 18th in the NFL, all of them spent with the Pack.
