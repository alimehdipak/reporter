His playoffs, however, were hampered by first a torn ligament in his right shooting thumb that he suffered in Game 3 of Philadelphia&#8217;s first round series against the Toronto Raptors, and then a facial fracture and concussion he suffered in Game 6 after being hit in the head with an inadvertent elbow by Toronto Raptors forward Pascal Siakam.<\/p>\n<p>Those injuries caused Embiid to miss the first two games of the Miami series, and forced him to play wearing a mask upon his return in Game 3.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>May 19, 2022Tim BontempsESPN Philadelphia&#8217;s City Council decided to give Joel Embiid an MVP award Thursday morning.But rather than the NBA&#8217;s Most Valuable Player award that the superstar center for the Philadelphia 76ers hoped to win this year &#8212; he wound up finishing second behind Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic &#8212; he&#8217;ll have to be&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":3170,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[13],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3169"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3169"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3169\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":7502,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3169\/revisions\/7502"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3169"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3169"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3169"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
