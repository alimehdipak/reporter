As I strutted past the long line outside the Museum of Natural History, several men, women and kids shot me quizzical stares.<\/p>\n<p>And one construction worker practically gave himself whiplash checking out the garment\u2019s backside \u2014\u00a0printed with the image of a shapely bare booty seemingly modeled after a Kardashian\u2019s \u2014\u00a0as I crossed the street. Who needs a BBL when you can fake it with fashion?<\/p>\n<p>    <!--If the slideshow is embedded in another post type add the inline wrapper --> \t    <\/p>\n<p>It probably helped that the boobs, crotch and butt screened across the dress more or less matched up with my own bits; on Shein\u2019s website, one petite shopper complained that the design\u2019s \u201ctitties were literally near [her] belly button,\u201d and the \u201cvagina was touching [her] knees,\u201d calling the effect \u201cjust so embarrassing and not cute.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Still, I was somewhat surprised more people didn\u2019t stop and stare at my optical illusion of an outfit; while a few folks sneaked peeks on the subway, most just had their faces buried in their phones. I guess it\u2019s true what they say: New Yorkers really have seen it all.<\/p>\n<p>    <!--If the slideshow is embedded in another post type add the inline wrapper --> \t    <\/p>\n<p>Or perhaps it\u2019s just that the trompe l\u2019oeil naked dress isn\u2019t quite as shocking as its truly nude predecessor; I certainly felt more confident out and about in mine than I would have in something seriously sheer.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe I\u2019ll even try it out again for my next night out \u2014 after all, wearing a dress screen-printed with a perfect body is definitely easier than working out.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" alt=\"naked dress\" src=\"https:\/\/pagesix.com\/2022\/07\/15\/\" \/>That\u2019s a wrap!Gabriela Milian<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There\u2019s a new \u201cnaked\u201d dress in town \u2014 and instead of the see-through, sparkly styles we\u2019ve seen on red carpets for years, this season\u2019s take is completely covered up.
