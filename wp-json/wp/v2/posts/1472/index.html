Long white sofas wrapped around coffee tables artfully arranged with oversized candles, books about motorcycles, sleek miniature cars and \u2014 as the centerpiece \u2014 a giant bowl of M&amp;M\u2019s (classic milk chocolate, what else would you expect?).<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"731\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/ralph-lauren-Janelle-Monae.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=731\" alt=\"Janelle Monae at Ralph Lauren\" \/>Janelle MonaeCourtesy of the Designer    <\/p>\n<p>New York powerhouses like Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour and Mayor Eric Adams held court in one corner of the room, while famous friends-of-the-brand Jessica Chastain and Janelle Mon\u00e1e sparkled in another. In between were more glittering faces: Zoey Deutch (in bright pink), Lily Collins (in classic black-and-white suiting), TikTok star Nic Kaufmann (in a double-breasted olive suit) and influencer Ivy Getty (channeling groovy vibes in a Western shirt).<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/ralph-lauren-lily-collins.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=683\" alt=\"Lily Collins at Ralph Lauren\" \/>Lily CollinsCourtesy of the designer    <\/p>\n<p>The runway was dominated by classic Ralph Lauren looks, mostly in shades of black and white with pops of red. Gigi Hadid opened the show in preppy perfection: a logo sweater styled with a popped collar underneath, anchored by a pair of two-tone spectator heels. Lucky Blue Smith followed suit in an impeccably tailored suit (followed by more impeccably tailored suits). <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/ralph-lauren-lucky-blue.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=683\" alt=\"Lucky Blue walks Ralph Lauren\" \/>Lucky Blue SmithCourtesy of the designer    <\/p>\n<p>There was also a nod to apr\u00e8s-ski elegance: puffer coats were paired with bow ties, Fair Isle knits glammed up with sequined gowns and ball skirts. An Art Deco dress that glimmered with the New York City skyline paid homage to Lauren\u2019s hometown. The rest of the eveningwear remained mostly sleek (see Shalom Harlow\u2019s sheer column dress; Tyson Beckford\u2019s black-tie moment or Bella Hadid\u2019s asymmetrical white gown), save for an off-shoulder, full-skirted midi dress worn by Laetitia Casta.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/ralph-lauren-Vittoria-Cerreti.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=683\" alt=\"Vittoria\" \/>Vittoria CerettiCourtesy of the designer    <\/p>\n<p>The finale wowed with a true New York moment, as model Vittoria Ceretti strutted out in a pantsuit and bow tie, topped with a bomber jacket and baseball cap, both adorned with the NY Yankees logo. Last night\u2019s return to the runway was a sartorial home run indeed.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ralph Lauren\u00a0personifies all-American classic style with a modern twist.\u00a0 It\u2019s an ethos the man behind the legendary fashion brand has lived and breathed throughout his 50-plus years at the forefront of American&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":1473,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[7],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1472"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1472"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1472\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1472"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1472"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1472"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
