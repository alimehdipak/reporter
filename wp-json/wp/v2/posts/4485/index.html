The most refreshing thing about this show is that it\u2019s exploring the idea that the future could be better,\u201d Monaghan, 45, told The Post.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMoonhaven,\u201d streaming on AMC+, is set in a version of the future in which Earth is dying and there\u2019s a utopian community on the moon. Paul (Monaghan) is a detective, but his job is very different from what it looks like on Earth. Since an AI system enables him and his partner Arlo (Kadeem Hardison) to determine the cause and culprit of a crime, their jobs are more akin to new-agey therapists as they console people about how to respond to a crime.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/moonhaven-dominic-monaghan-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Paul (Dominic Monaghan, right) and Arlo (Kadeem Hardison, left) stand in a field looking serious wearing tunics.  \" \/>Paul (Dominic Monaghan, right) and Arlo (Kadeem Hardison, left) are detectives on the moon.

Szymon Lazewski\/AMC+    <\/p>\n<p>Their idyllic existence gets shaken up when Paul and Arlo are tasked with solving their first murder, right before the community\u2019s phased migration back to Earth. To complicate matters, this overlaps with the arrival of a trio from the home planet: Bella Sway (Emma McDonald), a cargo pilot and smuggler; Earth diplomat Indira Mare (Amara Karan); and her bodyguard Tomm (Joe Manganiello), all of whom bring attitudes that are more skeptical and cynical than the \u201clunar\u201d people are used to. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe character I play is relatively naive \u2014 he\u2019s quite an innocent man, idealistic. So, I just stayed in a kind of childlike headspace, thinking that humans were going to not lie and were going to be good and do the right thing,\u201d Monaghan said. \u201cThose are the elements of Paul that makes him unique when you compare him to the Earthers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/moonhaven-dominic-monaghan-7.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Paul (Dominic Monaghan) and Bella (Emma McDonald) stand in a field looking grim wearing tunics. \" \/>Paul (Dominic Monaghan) and Bella (Emma McDonald) in \u201cMoonhaven.\u201d Szymon Lazewski\/AMC    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/moonhaven-dominic-monaghan-5.jpg?w=1024\" \/>Paul (Dominic Monaghan) and Bella (Emma McDonald) in \u201cMoonhaven.\u201d Szymon Lazewski\/AMC    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cMoonhaven\u201d is the latest in Monaghan\u2019s career of sci-fi and fantasy fare; he\u2019s also been in \u201cStar Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker\u201d and \u201cX Men Origins: Wolverine,\u201d and he\u2019s currently also starring in the Audible podcast series \u201cMoriarty: The Devil\u2019s Game,\u201d in which he plays the Sherlock Holmes villain.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing necessarily that I won\u2019t do, it\u2019s just all about characters, that\u2019s what drives me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m always looking to do something new.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/moonhaven-dominic-monaghan-6.jpg?w=683\" \/>Paul (Dominic Monaghan) is a detective on the moon on \u201cMoonhaven.\u201d Szymon Lazewski\/AMC+    <\/p>\n<p>Most genre projects come with enthusiastic fan bases, and Monaghan said he\u2019s used to that by now.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere was a point where \u2018Lord of the Rings\u2019 was the biggest film of any given year that it was out. So, for three years in a row, I was lucky enough to be in the biggest film in the world, and then in 2004 when \u2018Lost\u2019 came out, I was lucky enough to be in the biggest film of the year, and the biggest TV show on the planet,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that point, things get hectic. It\u2019s difficult then to be going to supermarkets and out and about. I still did it, but it definitely got crazy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d franchise is returning to the spotlight soon, with the Sept. 2 premiere of the Prime Video series \u201cThe Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s great. It\u2019s fun to see new life being breathed into that incredible series of books written by Professor Tolkien,\u201d Monaghan said. \u201cI\u2019m interested to see what people do. Obviously, Amazon is not shy of money, and they\u2019ve put a lot of money into this particular project. Fingers crossed it ends up being something that finds a new audience.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"680\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/dominic-monaghan-lotr-2.jpg?w=680\" \/>Dominic Monaghan as Merry the hobbit in \u201cThe Lord of The Rings: The Return of the King.\u201d \u00a9New Line Cinema\/Courtesy Evere        <\/p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t think it will change the level of interest in the films, however.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think those movies are kind of timeless \u2026 multiple times a day people will tell me they just finished watching those films, and how much it moved them, or how important it was to their family. So, I don\u2019t know if the interest has ever truly waned. But maybe it will pick up with the Amazon project. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing a few conventions with [\u2018Rings\u2019 co-stars] Elijah [Wood] and Sean [Astin] and Billy [Boyd] recently, and when the four of us go out for dinner \u2026 you find people losing their marbles, which is fun. I would be the same. If I saw Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, C-3PO and Chewbacca having dinner, I would be geeking out, too.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dominic Monaghan has played a hobbit in \u201cThe Lord of the Rings,\u201d a castaway in \u201cLost\u201d and, in his latest series, \u201cMoonhaven,\u201d a detective solving a crime on the moon.\u00a0 \u201cI like&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":4486,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[5],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4485"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/6"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4485"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4485\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":6284,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4485\/revisions\/6284"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4485"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4485"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4485"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
