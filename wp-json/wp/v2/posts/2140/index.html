Additionally, sources told ESPN that the letter notes that former Yankees pitching coach Larry Rothschild called the replay room to ask about pitch identification, which is against the rules.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;At that time, use of the replay room to decode signs was not expressly prohibited by MLB rules as long as the information was not communicated electronically to the dugout,&#8221; MLB said in a statement Tuesday.<\/p>\n<p>The letter to Cashman did not suggest any real-time conveyance of signs from the dugout to the hitters during their at-bats &#8212; the threshold established in the Astros&#8217; case &#8212; or violations after Manfred&#8217;s memo in September 2017.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;As the facts of the letter again show, the Yankees were not penalized for sign stealing but were penalized for improper use of the telephone in the replay room,&#8221; the Yankees said in a statement Tuesday. &#8220;&#8230; At that point in time, sign stealing was utilized as a competitive tool by numerous teams throughout Major League Baseball and only became illegal after the Commissioner&#8217;s specific delineation of the rules on September 15, 2017.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Yankees were fined $100,000 by Major League Baseball, and the money was allocated for Hurricane Irma relief.<\/p>\n<p>That the Yankees fought to keep the letter under court-ordered seal in recent years raised eyebrows and fed conspiracy theories about what&#8217;s in it &#8212; to the degree that some baseball officials have been befuddled by the team&#8217;s handling of the issue, believing it would have been better to simply release the letter and move on.<\/p>\n<p>In their statement Tuesday, the Yankees said they fought the release of the letter &#8220;to prevent the incorrect equating of events that occurred&#8221; and that the $100,000 fine that was imposed on the team was &#8220;<em>before <\/em>MLB&#8217;s new regulations and standards were issued.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In its investigation of the Astros, MLB determined that with the use of a television monitor, hitters were informed of the identity of the forthcoming pitch during their at-bats, in real time &#8212; extensive, systematic violations that would lead to the suspensions and dismissals of general manager Jeff Luhnow, manager A.J.
