And making everybody happy. Because that\u2019s what it\u2019s about. That\u2019s how they keep their jobs on the business side. That\u2019s how DA stays the head coach. And that\u2019s how I stay the quarterback.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou&#8217;ve been around me, I&#8217;m a very optimistic dude. Everything happens for a reason in my book. It&#8217;s all a part of God&#8217;s plan for me, and I embrace that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Allen echoed Winston&#8217;s comments on Tuesday morning.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cJameis understands how our business operates,\u201d Allen said. \u201cHe and I had a couple of good &#8212; call it tough &#8212; conversations. And I thought it was a good process.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Allen declined to go into extensive detail about the Saints\u2019 pursuit of Watson, but he did state that there was an &#8220;interest on our part.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We did our due diligence, we did our homework and he ended up going somewhere else,\u201d Allen said. \u201cSo we moved forward from there and went full speed ahead with Jameis, and we\u2019re excited about that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Winston, who was speaking to the New Orleans media for the first time since last season, said his injury rehab is ahead of schedule and he is \u201cgoing to be back well before training camp.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He also admitted he was surprised when former Saints coach Sean Payton decided to step away in January, which also weighed on his decision.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nfl\/500\/nor.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\" \/> What you need to know about the New Orleans Saints:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Saints&#8217; free-agent signings \u00bb<br \/>\u2022 Tracker: Latest signings and news \u00bb<br \/>\u2022 Grading big moves \u00bb |  Top 100 FAs \u00bb<br \/>\u2022 Free-agency coverage \u00bb |  More NFL \u00bb<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you lose Sean Payton, one of the best playcallers to ever coach this game, that is probably the biggest thing that I had to really sit with this offseason, because I came to the saints for Sean and [former quarterback Drew Brees], and neither one of those people are here,\u201d Winston said. \u201c[But] definitely knowing that DA has been a part of this organization for a long time [as the Saints\u2019 defensive coordinator], I know that he has what it takes to be a successful head coach.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, we&#8217;re tied together. So I got faith in DA.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Winston also pointed out that offensive coordinator Pete Carmichael Jr. and quarterbacks coach Ronald Curry remain in their roles. That \u201ccontinuity\u201d is a big reason why he is excited about returning to the Saints for a third consecutive season.<\/p>\n<p>And Winston said he is especially looking forward to working with former All-Pro receiver  Michael Thomas, who missed all of last season with an ankle injury. The Saints\u2019 passing offense finished last in the NFL last season in large part because of his and Thomas&#8217; injuries and others across the offensive line. But Winston said Thomas&#8217; return should help change things \u201cdrastically.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Winston has shown a great deal of humility since his original team, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, decided to part ways with him in 2020 and he signed a minimal contract to learn under Payton and Brees.<img data-src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2021\/1213\/nfl_mcshay-mock-draft_16x9_608x342.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2021\/1213\/nfl_mcshay-mock-draft_16x9_608x342.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Ranks:<\/b> Kiper \u00bb | McShay \u00bb | Positions \u00bb<br \/>\u2022 <b>Mocks:<\/b> Kiper \u00bb | McShay \u00bb | Reid \u00bb<br \/>\u2022 Stacking the QBs \u00bb | Intriguing teams \u00bb<br \/>\u2022 Full draft order \u00bb | First Draft podcast \u00bb<br \/>\u2022 <b>More coverage \u00bb | Full rankings \u00bb<\/b><\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>However, he was especially vocal Monday about the level of confidence he has in himself &#8212; and that he wanted to see what type of interest was out there from other teams in free agency this year.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI can do everything your favorite quarterback can do,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>The former Heisman Trophy winner and 2015 No. 1 overall draft pick went 5-2 as New Orleans\u2019 starter last season before his injury, setting a career high with a passer rating of 102.8. He averaged 186 passing yards in his six complete games and completed 59% of his passes. Winston threw 14 touchdown passes with three interceptions, proving he could overcome the turnover issue that plagued him in Tampa Bay.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn conversations with other teams or with the Saints &#8230; I was curious to see, \u2018If you want me to lead this team, what do you think about me? What do you believe that I can accomplish with this team? And are you willing to grow with me and allow this team to get built around me as the quarterback?\u2019\u201d Winston said. \u201cBecause we know that two of the most important pieces to this whole chess\/football team is the head coach and the quarterback.
