In this blog, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gatewayfamilydentalca.com\/\">dentist in Bakersfield, California<\/a> will talk about wisdom teeth, why &amp; how they are removed, and how to recover quickly following their removal.<\/p>\n<h2>What are wisdom teeth?<\/h2>\n<p>Wisdom teeth are also known as your third molars. They are the last set of teeth to erupt, commonly popping out during your late teens or early adulthood. Many people consuming modern diets have jaws too small to accommodate these sets, therefore, experiencing gum swelling or pain when wisdom teeth try to erupt.<\/p>\n<h2>Why are they called wisdom teeth?<\/h2>\n<p>Many physical changes occur in your lifetime, including your mouth. Wisdom teeth usually happen between the ages of 17 and 21. They are called wisdom teeth because they erupt at a more mature age compared to other teeth.<\/p>\n<h2>Why are wisdom teeth removed?<\/h2>\n<p>Not everyone needs to have their wisdom teeth removed. You won\u2019t need wisdom teeth removal when your teeth are correctly placed in your mouth. But that\u2019s not the case for most people. Wisdom teeth sometimes grow only partially (impaction), leading to gum infection and pain.<br \/>\nWhen your dentist diagnoses this issue, they will recommend you to remove them right away.<\/p>\n<p>Following are some reasons why wisdom teeth are removed:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gum infection<\/li>\n<li>Tooth decay<\/li>\n<li>Crowded teeth<\/li>\n<li>Pain sensation<\/li>\n<li>Cyst formation<\/li>\n<li>Prosthetic concerns<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What are the symptoms of problematic wisdom teeth?<\/h2>\n<p>Here are the symptoms of wisdom teeth that need to be removed:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jaw stiffness or pain near the area<\/li>\n<li>Irritation when a tooth comes in<\/li>\n<li>Tooth growing at an awkward angle<\/li>\n<li>Crowding of other teeth<\/li>\n<li>Swelling in gum tissues<\/li>\n<li>Tooth decay<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>How can your dentist help?<\/h2>\n<p>Your dentist can help you in the following ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Carry out an X-ray to determine the position of your wisdom teeth<\/li>\n<li>Teach effective ways to clean around the erupting wisdom teeth<\/li>\n<li>Recommend effective mouthwashes, dental cleaning tools, and antibiotics if needed<\/li>\n<li>Perform wisdom teeth extraction when required<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Can you take wisdom teeth out with braces on?<\/h2>\n<p>Yes, you can have your wisdom teeth removed even if you have braces. The surgery won\u2019t affect your orthodontic treatment. Moreover, your braces won\u2019t impact your recovery from wisdom teeth extraction.<\/p>\n<h2>Is it necessary to remove wisdom teeth if I have braces on?<\/h2>\n<p>That\u2019s a common question that needs to be addressed. The short answer is no. You don\u2019t need to remove your wisdom teeth if you have braces. It\u2019s a common misconception that wisdom teeth push all other teeth when they erupt.<\/p>\n<h2>How are wisdom teeth removed?<\/h2>\n<p>If your dentist identifies your wisdom teeth causing complications to your dental health, they will suggest a wisdom teeth removal procedure. Depending on the severity of the case, your dentist will remove them under local anesthetic or general anesthetic.<\/p>\n<p>Some cases involve an oral surgery to remove wisdom teeth when their degree of impaction is severe. In other cases, removing a wisdom tooth is a simple procedure that can be completed in a single visit.<\/p>\n<h2>What should you eat after having your wisdom teeth removed?<\/h2>\n<p>Once you undergo the procedure, your dentist will recommend you to eat soft and protein-rich foods for the first few days. Yogurt, cottage cheese, apple sauce, and fruit smoothies are great options to increase vitamin intake.<\/p>\n<p>Your mouth may remain numb for a while, depending on the anesthetic used. So you need to avoid chewy or hot foods or drinks until you no longer feel numbness.<\/p>\n<p>You should also avoid spicy, hard, sticky, and crunchy foods as they can irritate the surgical site and delay healing.<\/p>\n<h2>Recover quickly from wisdom tooth surgery<\/h2>\n<p>The recovery following your surgery might take several days. If you feel discomfort or swelling, you can use ice packs or perform salt-water rinses to manage pain and inflammation. Over-the-counter pain medications can also help reduce pain. Make sure to avoid smoking and consuming alcohol for swift healing. Call your dentist if you notice pus discharge or experience fever or severe pain.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"CDt4Ke zfr3Q\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/view\/kbizz\/gateway\"><span class=\" puwcIf\">Gateway Family Dentistry<\/span><\/a><\/h2>\n<p class=\"CDt4Ke zfr3Q\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https:\/\/g.page\/gatewaydentist\">13029 Stockdale Hwy #100, Bakersfield, CA 93314<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"CDt4Ke zfr3Q\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"tel:661-829-7905\">661-829-7905<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you\u2019re looking for a wisdom teeth ultimate guide, you\u2019re at the right place.
