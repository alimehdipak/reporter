Veneers are small porcelain pieces that fit onto your teeth, perfecting their appearance. In recent years, an alternative to veneers, known as \u201clumineers,\u201d has become extremely popular in cosmetic dentistry. But which one is better? Here are the differences between veneers and lumineers and how you can decide which one is better for you.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Veneers vs. Lumineers: Application<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h3><strong>Veneers<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The best thing about veneers is they can improve nearly every aspect of your smile. Veneers can provide a relaxed way to permanently align and whiten your teeth. They can also restore chipped or cracked teeth. Before the application process begins, your <a href=\"https:\/\/blogbuzzers.wordpress.com\/2021\/01\/06\/is-root-canal-dangerous-or-just-misconceptions\/\">dentist<\/a> will remove around 0.2mm to 0.5mm of your enamel and bond veneer onto your teeth to give you an attractive appearance. The smooth surface will create a natural-looking appearance and ensure your teeth don\u2019t look bulky.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Lumineers<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Lumineers are ultra-thin, durable, and robust. Your teeth do not require preparation work, such as reshaping, drilling, or enamel removal. The procedure requires only two dental visits. Lumineers are placed directly over the tooth to give you an attractive smile. Your original teeth won\u2019t need any damage or enamel removal. Therefore, in terms of application, lumineers are better than veneers. Veneers vs. Lumineers: Material<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Veneers<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Veneers are made from dental porcelain and composite. Composite veneers are placed directly over your teeth. On the other hand, porcelain veneers are fabricated indirectly by dental technicians. These are bonded to the <a href=\"https:\/\/blogbuzzers.jimdofree.com\/2021\/01\/13\/what-to-do-for-pain-after-teeth-whitening\/\">teeth<\/a> with resin material. Veneers are monochromatic in color. Thus, they can easily match your natural teeth.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Lumineers<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Lumineers are ultra-thin; their thickness ranges from 0.2mm to 0.5mm. They\u2019re made from carinate porcelain and need little-to-no tooth reduction or sedation. Lumineers are a less invasive procedure as compared to traditional veneers.
