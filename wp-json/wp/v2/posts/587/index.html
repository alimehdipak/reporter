He believes some music artists will express their thoughts on Ukraine along with other meaningful topics that are \u201cclose to their hearts.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of those interesting balances in life we try to achieve, which is acknowledging what\u2019s happening in the world whilst allowing yourself the grace to celebrate some of the moments that are also going on,\u201d said the comedian and host of \u201cThe Daily Show with Trevor Noah\u201d on Comedy Central.<\/p>\n<p>Noah said most of his show\u2019s coverage has focused on Ukraine, so he\u2019s looking forward to an entertaining night at the Grammys \u2014 a place where world issues can be acknowledged as well.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s also important for us to be able to take a break from everything,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the ultimate quandary we face. Is it important to highlight issues around the world? Definitely. It\u2019s also important to celebrate things that are happening in the world.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Noah returns for his second hosting stint at the Grammys, which airs live on CBS and Paramount+. The ceremony shifted from Los Angeles to Las Vegas because of the rising COVID-19 cases and the omicron variant in January, with organizers citing \u201ctoo many risks\u201d to hosting the performance-filled show at the time.<\/p>\n<p>Last year, the Grammys had a music festival vibe with parts of the show held outdoors in an intimate in-person setting with music artists mixed with pre-taped performances. But for the upcoming ceremony, Noah anticipates a hybrid model that includes fans at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think the live element does bring in an energy but then you do sacrifice a little bit of that intimacy,\u201d said Noah, who took a careful approach hosting \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d from his New York apartment during the pandemic last year but could not pass up the offer to host his first Grammys in person.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBut it\u2019s nice to have fans cheering for their favorite artist,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see the performances because one of the biggest reasons the Grammys is my favorite award show is that it is a live music festival.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/trevor-noah-grammy-awards-2022-2-copy.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=682\" \/>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to have fans cheering for their favorite artist,\u201d Noah said of the gig.

Justin Bieber, Doja Cat and H.E.R. are tied for the second-most nominations with eight apiece.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a celebration of an industry coming back to life,\u201d Noah said. \u201cI think a lot of the artists will enjoy Vegas. Nobody lives there. There\u2019s an element of this (show) that\u2019s like a music camp. I think it\u2019s going to bring a different energy, and I\u2019m excited to be a part of it.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>LOS ANGELES \u2014 The Grammy Awards is a festive vibe celebrating music\u2019s best, but host Trevor Noah says the show may touch on some serious topics such as the ongoing crisis in&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":588,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[5],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/587"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/6"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=587"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/587\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=587"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=587"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=587"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
