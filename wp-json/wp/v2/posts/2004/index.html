There\u2019s always a role in society or human behavior for that,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>At the present moment, astronauts cannot afford to be intoxicated or inebriated in space, Hadfield said, but as space tourism grows, so might the feasibility of recreational drug use in the cosmos.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOn the space station, if there\u2019s an emergency, you are the fire department. You can\u2019t have intoxicated yourself or inebriated yourself or whatever, just because if something goes wrong, then you\u2019ll die,\u201d Hadfield said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOnce the population gets large enough, once you get to a stable enough situation, people are gonna want, you know, a drink. People are gonna want some pot,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>Last year, Hadfield even joined the board of advisers\u00a0for BioHarvest, a biotech company that focuses on plant cell growth at an industrial scale via liquid bioreactors.<\/p>\n<p>Hadfield told Futurism that the company, which is currently focusing on providing future astronauts with zero gravity-enhanced nutrients, has worked with cannabis plants for years.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/Astronaut-embed.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"or drunk in space for safety reasons, but as space tourism grows, people may be able to enjoy marijuana and alcohol. \" \/>Astronauts cant be high or drunk in space for safety reasons, but as space tourism grows, people may be able to enjoy marijuana and alcohol.
