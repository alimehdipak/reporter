With 4:45 left in the period, he immediately asked for a timeout and went to the locker room after appearing to tweak his right hamstring as he was jumping to challenge a Jaxson Hayes dunk in transition.<\/p>\n<p>The first-round series is 1-1 entering Game 3 on Friday in New Orleans.<\/p>\n<p>Booker has had hamstring issues for the past two seasons. In November, he strained his left hamstring on a play similar to the one Tuesday and missed seven games. Last year during the NBA Finals, he suffered a hamstring injury in Game 3 but played through it and kept it a secret at the time. During the 2020-21 regular season, he also had a left hamstring injury and missed four games.<\/p>\n<p>Williams said the experience of having to play at times this season without Booker, point guard Chris Paul and center Deandre Ayton does help.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Everybody has missed games except Mikal [Bridges],&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been able to navigate those situations well this year. We know we can do it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Suns were 8-6 in games without Booker this season.<\/p>\n<p>Paul said the Suns&#8217; season has been about next man up, and he credited Booker for making the trip to New Orleans when he could have stayed in Phoenix.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think he understands how important he is to our team,&#8221; Paul said. &#8220;He lets us see everything he sees on the court and we&#8217;ll go from there.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Added Ayton: &#8220;We need him. Just having that talk out there. Him pointing out things we normally don&#8217;t see. From his perspective, seeing how the offense flows, seeing what the defense is giving us. Just keeping that energy and making sure we&#8217;re always together, especially when we&#8217;re on the road.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the playoffs and it&#8217;s gonna be loud. We&#8217;ll need everybody. It&#8217;s definitely going to be a relief to see him even though he&#8217;s out for a little bit.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Suns began the week as the clear-cut title favorites at +220, but after the Game 2 loss and Booker&#8217;s injury, Phoenix is now co-favorites along with the Golden State Warriors.
