It was very light and silly and very funny. [For] the very last question, a woman stood up \u2014 she was shaking a little bit \u2014 and she said she watches the show with her niece, which is now her nephew. She had a quiver in her voice and she told us how important Isaac\u2019s story had been to her and her family to come together and speak about something so incredibly important and delicate in the development of a young person\u2019s life, such as transitioning. It felt safe to do that with a show that is also so kind and funny.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBrandon and I literally started crying on the stage,\u201d she said. \u201cWe walked off and looked at each other and said, \u2018This is why the show works. It\u2019s raucous and ridiculous and silly and then it punches you in the gut.&#8217;\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/CBS-Ghosts-12.jpg?w=1024\" \/>The apparitions in \u201cGhosts\u201d (from left): Brandon Scott Jones, Asher Grodman, Rebecca Wisocky, Devan Chandler, Richie Moriarty, Sheila Carrasco, Roman Zaragoza and Danielle Pinnock.CBS    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cGhosts\u201d is guilty of all of the above as it wraps its maiden season Thursday (April 21) at 9 p.m. as the season\u2019s most-watched new comedy. (It was renewed in January for Season 2.) Based on the eponymous British series, it revolves around Samantha (Rose McIver) and her husband Jay (Utkarsh Ambudkar), who move into an inherited country house \u2014 which they share with eight ghosts that only Samantha can see: Hetty, Isaac, Trevor (Asher Grodman), Pete (Richie Moriarty), Alberta (Danielle Pinnock), Flower (Sheila Carrasco), Thorfinn (Devan Chandler) and Sasappis (Rom\u00e1n Zaragoza).<\/p>\n<p>Although Wisocky\u2019s TV resume dates back to 1996, Hetty is only her second role as a series regular (she played Evelyn Powell on Lifetime\u2019s \u201cDevious Maids\u201d from 2013-2016).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNone of us know why we\u2019re stuck in purgatory, but all of us have realized that we\u2019re willing and capable of change,\u201d Wisocky said of her fellow ghosts. \u201cI think that happened when Samantha could suddenly interact with us, which created a little renaissance in the house, a feeling that change was possible.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAll of us never really fully lived in life, and only in death are we figuring out what we got wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cBut having the experiences of being around people and points of view that we would never have seen or experienced or even thought about in our own time \u2014 I think that\u2019s what so lovely about it.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/CBS-Ghosts-8.jpg?w=1024\" \/>Utkarsh Ambudkar and Rose McIver as Jay and Samantha, who is able to see the \u201cGhosts.\u201dCBS    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe writers have been really smart about keeping the show light and fast and smart and silly and funny, but there\u2019s also historical accuracy that\u2019s provocative in terms of what these characters have been wrestling with \u2014 and what they\u2019ve been blind to.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Part of the show\u2019s success is the onscreen chemistry between the entire ensemble, which has carried over into their real lives.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt sounds really cliche but we all really dig each other. We hang out. Everyone was over at my house last week,\u201d Wisocky said. \u201cI\u2019m very close with Brandon and very close with the girls \u2014 we call ourselves \u2018The Lady Ghost Society\u2019 and we\u2019ve been pitching [the writers] all kind of book clubs for the ladies to get into, but the writers don\u2019t need our help.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur fans have been so involved and it\u2019s been so exciting\u00a0to see way the show has ignited this passion and investment for us and for the characters,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a GIF of Hetty saying something in the show, and one of our fans titled it, \u2018It\u2019s not just a haunted house, it\u2019s a haunted home.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI thought that was freakin\u2019 genius and says it all.
