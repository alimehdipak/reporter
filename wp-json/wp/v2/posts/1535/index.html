When tornadoes touch down, we brace for news of property damage, injuries, and loss of life, but the high-speed wind storms wreak environmental havoc, too.Jul 18, 2019<\/p>\n<h2>What effects do tornadoes have?<\/h2>\n<p>Every year in the United States, tornadoes do about 400 million dollars in damage and <b>kill about 70 people on average<\/b>. Extremely high winds tear homes and businesses apart. Winds can also destroy bridges, flip trains, send cars and trucks flying, tear the bark off trees, and suck all the water from a riverbed.<\/p>\n<h2>What are the negative effects of a tornado?<\/h2>\n<p>The impact of a tornado results in both direct and indirect losses to the local economy. Direct losses result from the destruction of assets from the initial impact of the tornado and include the <b>loss of human lives, roads, power, phone lines, crops, factories, homes, and natural resources<\/b>.<\/p>\n<p>However, the areas where tornadoes strike are greatly impacted. <b>Trees and plants can be uprooted, and diseases in the soil are spread<\/b>. Wildlife loses their lives or habitat. Be that as it may, the effects of tornadoes on the environment may not be all negative.<\/p>\n<h2>What effects does tornadoes have on animals?<\/h2>\n<p>The aftermath of a tornado is pure destruction. It <b>kills animals which affect the food chain<\/b>. Animals can kill other animals because they need the food to survive because they need energy to live or else they die. Tornadoes can destroy farms so there is no food to survive.<\/p>\n<h2>How do tornadoes affect businesses?<\/h2>\n<p>Twisters can <b>inflict financial damage on a community<\/b> in any number of ways, from crop damage to structural problems as well as insurance losses and lost revenue due to unforeseen downtime. \u2026<\/p>\n<h2>What is Tornado causes and effects?<\/h2>\n<p>Tornadoes are cause by <b>the thunderstorms being extremely large, unstable and with wind shear in the lower region of the atmosphere<\/b>. \u2026 Firstly, when the thunderstorm approaches, the wind direction, speed changes in the upper area of the atmosphere and causes an invisible horizontal spinning effect in the lower region.<\/p>\n<h2>What kind of damage can a tornado do to buildings and nature?<\/h2>\n<p>A tornado is a violent rotating column of air extending from a thunderstorm to the ground. The most violent tornadoes are capable of tremendous destruction with wind speeds of up to 300 mph. They can <b>destroy large buildings<\/b>, uproot trees and hurl vehicles hundreds of yards. They can also drive straw into trees.<\/p>\n<h2>Can a human survive a tornado?<\/h2>\n<p>Although the most violent tornadoes can level and blow away almost any house and those within it, extremely violent EF5 tornadoes (those with wind speeds of 200MPH or more) are rare. Most tornadoes are much weaker. <b>You can survive a tornado if you follow safety precautions<\/b>.<\/p>\n<h2>What are some fun facts about tornadoes?<\/h2>\n<p><b>Tornado Fun Facts<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tornadoes are formed from thunderstorms.<\/li>\n<li>Tornadoes are made of air.<\/li>\n<li>Tornadoes are measured with the Fujita Scale.<\/li>\n<li>Tornadoes have very high winds.<\/li>\n<li>Most tornadoes occur in Tornado Alley.<\/li>\n<li>Tornadoes can be created over water.<\/li>\n<li>A tornado has other names.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What are 5 Survival Tips for tornadoes?<\/h2>\n<p><b>Here\u2019s how you can survive a twister with 5 simple tornado safety tips.<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have Multiple Ways of Receiving the Tornado Warning.

Rising air from the ground pushes up on the swirling air and tips it over. The funnel of swirling air begins to suck up more warm air from the ground. \u2026 When the funnel touches the ground it becomes a tornado.<\/p>\n<h2>Why tornadoes are caused?<\/h2>\n<p>Tornadoes develop from <b>severe thunderstorms in warm, moist, unstable air along and ahead of cold fronts<\/b>. Such thunderstorms also may generate large hail and damaging winds. When intense springtime storm systems produce large, persistent areas that support tornado development, major outbreaks can occur.<\/p>\n<h2>What is a tornado where it is formed what damage does it cause?<\/h2>\n<p>Enhanced Fujita Scale and Damage Extent<\/p>\n<p>Tornadoes <b>get their ratings from the strength of their winds<\/b>, which can also determine the damages they cause. The Fujita scale gets its name from the scientist who introduced it in 1971, Tetsuya Fujita.<\/p>\n<h2>Has anyone survived the eye of a tornado?<\/h2>\n<p>Missouri \u2013 <b>Matt Suter<\/b> was 19 years old when he had an experience that he will never forget. He survived after being swept up inside a tornado. \u2026 More than a dozen tornadoes spawned from the supercell thunderstorms that day, claiming the lives of two people. But Matt was lucky.<\/p>\n<h2>Whats it like inside a tornado?<\/h2>\n<p>\u201c<b>The air is remarkably smooth inside<\/b>,\u201d said Timmer. \u201cMy ears popped from the low pressure.\u201d The air flowing into the circulation of a tornado is \u201csmooth\u201d convectively, meaning the air is stable, and on the path deemed by the circulatory flow of the storm.<\/p>\n<h2>Can you breathe in a tornado?<\/h2>\n<p>Researchers estimate that the density of the air would be 20% lower than what\u2019s found at high altitudes. To put this in perspective, breathing in a tornado would be <b>equivalent to breathing at an altitude of 8,000 m<\/b> (26,246.72 ft). At that level, you generally need assistance to be able to breathe.<\/p>\n<h2>Has Antarctica ever had a tornado?<\/h2>\n<p>Tornadoes have touched down on <b>every continent except Antarctica<\/b>. \u2026 A tornado occurrence in Antarctica isn\u2019t impossible, however, according to NOAA\u2019s National Centers for Environmental Information. \u201cFor tornadoes to form, there needs to be a moist, warm climate,\u201d said Lavin.<\/p>\n<h2>How fast can a tornado go?<\/h2>\n<p>They can move slowly, appearing nearly stationary, to as <b>fast as 60 mph<\/b>. The size and shape of a tornado does not necessarily say anything about the tornado\u2019s strength or it\u2019s capability to inflict damage.<br \/>\n\u2026<br \/>\nTornado Classification.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Weak<\/th>\n<th>EF0, EF1<\/th>\n<th>Wind speeds of <b>65 to 110 mph<\/b><\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Violent<\/td>\n<td>EF4, EF5<\/td>\n<td>Wind speeds of 166 to 200 mph or more<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h2>How do tornadoes survive for kids?<\/h2>\n<p><b>DURING A TORNADO:<\/b><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to a basement.<\/li>\n<li>If you do not have a basement, go to an interior room without windows on the lowest floor such as a bathroom or closet.<\/li>\n<li>If you can, get under a sturdy piece of furniture, like a table.<\/li>\n<li>If you live in a mobile home get out. \u2026<\/li>\n<li>Get out of automobiles.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>What happens if you get sucked into a tornado?<\/h2>\n<p>Being sucked up by a tornado would result <b>in probable death<\/b>. Originally Answered: What happened if a tornado hit a person? A Tornado will not hit a person, but will pick them up with other debris which can hit you either on the ground or while being carried by the Tornado.<\/p>\n<h2>Can you survive a tornado in a car?<\/h2>\n<p><b>There is no safe option when caught in a tornado<\/b> in a car, just slightly less-dangerous ones. If the tornado is visible, far away, and the traffic is light, you may be able to drive out of its path by moving at right angles to the tornado. \u2026 Stay in the car with the seat belt on.<\/p>\n<h2>Can tornadoes be stopped?<\/h2>\n<p>Can tornadoes be stopped? \u2026 <b>No one has tried to disrupt the tornado<\/b> because the methods to do so could likely cause even more damage than the tornado. Detonating a nuclear bomb, for example, to disrupt a tornado would be even more deadly and destructive than the tornado itself.<\/p>\n<h2>What is an F5 tornado?<\/h2>\n<p>This is a list of tornadoes which have been officially or unofficially labeled as F5, EF5, or an equivalent rating, <b>the highest possible ratings on the various tornado intensity scales<\/b>. \u2026 F5 tornadoes were estimated to have had maximum winds between 261 mph (420 km\/h) and 318 mph (512 km\/h).<\/p>\n<h2>How are tornadoes named?<\/h2>\n<p>They began in 1953 <b>using American female names<\/b>. Apparently they were running out of female names, so in 1978 they began using male names. In 1998 they began using foreign names. \u2026 Over 1,000 tornadoes will hit the United States each year.<\/p>\n<h2>What are the 3 types of tornadoes?<\/h2>\n<p><b>There are different types of tornadoes: wedges, elephant trunks, waterspouts, ropes.<\/b> <b>Here\u2019s how to tell them apart<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Supercell tornadoes.

Tornadoes touch down all over the world, though most often in the United States. A tornado is often a funnel cloud\u2014a rotating column of air\u2014 that stretches from a storm to the ground. To be a tornado it must touch the ground.<\/p>\n<h2>Can a tornado form without clouds?<\/h2>\n<p><b>Tornadoes can occur without funnel clouds<\/b>, as shown in this example from NSSL. \u2026 Most likely, the pressure drop and lift in the tornado vortex was too weak to cool and condense a visible funnel; and\/or the air below cloud base was too dry.<\/p>\n<h2>What are the five warning signs that a tornado may occur?<\/h2>\n<p><b>Regardless of the time of year, you need to be prepared, and that involves being able to tell when a tornado is going to develop.<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dark, Greenish Sky. \u2026<\/li>\n<li>High Frequencies of In-Cloud Lightning. \u2026<\/li>\n<li>Calm After a Thunderstorm. \u2026<\/li>\n<li>Funnel-Shaped Cloud. \u2026<\/li>\n<li>Continuous Rumble. \u2026<\/li>\n<li>Falling Debris. \u2026<\/li>\n<li>Tornado Watch vs. \u2026<\/li>\n<li>Help From Earth Networks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>How are tornadoes and hurricanes alike?<\/h2>\n<p>Perhaps the only similarity between tornadoes and hurricanes is that <b>they both contain strong rotating winds that can cause damage<\/b>. \u2026 Also, strong tornadoes usually occur over land, while hurricanes almost always form over the ocean.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How Do Tornadoes Effect The Environment?
