It&#8217;s funny, in the tournament everything is put into one game. It&#8217;s not the NBA where you play a five-game series or best-of-seven; it&#8217;s one game. You can get defined by that. &#8230; But the Mountain West has been phenomenal this year.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I just think that&#8217;s the flavor of the week,&#8221; San Diego State coach Brian Dutcher said of the idea that the conference had somehow failed to live up to its promise. &#8220;Last year was the Big Ten, right now it&#8217;s the Mountain West and tomorrow after the games it might be someone else.
