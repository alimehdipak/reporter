I saw him at Aria and he was betting $200,000 a spin at roulette.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>In fact, the musician puts enough money into action \u2014 via betting sports and gambling in the pit \u2014 said Krackomberger, that \u201chis play is worthy of $100,000 in promotional chips to walk in the door.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Drake is no doubt basking in the glory of his $1 million wager that Israel Adesanya would win his UFC fight last Saturday night. But don\u2019t feel too bad for the house. Adesanya was such a favorite that, according to odds offered by FanDuel, the sky-high bet paid a relatively modest $222,000 even though Drake would have surrendered a cool million if he lost.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/israel-adesanya-04.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Drake bet $1 million on Israel Adesanya (left) to win his UFC fight on Saturday night.\" \/>Drake bet $1 million on Israel Adesanya (left) to win his UFC fight on Saturday night.Getty Images    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/charles-leclerc-03.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Drake lost $250,000 on the Spanish Grand Prix in May 2022, wagering that Charles Leclerc would win it all.\" \/>Drake lost $250,000 on the Spanish Grand Prix in May 2022, wagering that Charles Leclerc would win it all.Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>But with a net worth of some $150 million, Drake \u2014 who keeps fans abreast of his gambling capers via posts on Instagram where he goes by @champagnepapi \u2014 can clearly afford to spew big bucks. This past May, he dropped more than $250,000 on the Spanish Grand Prix, wagering that Charles Leclerc would take it all. But the Formula 1 racer from Monaco lost power on the 27th lap \u2014\u00a0and Drake lost his bucks.<\/p>\n<p>He had better luck at the Super Bowl, betting $393,000 that the Rams would win. Then he blew $314,000 on a mixed-sports parlay bet in which he had the Nets, the Bluejays and and the Mavericks all in line to win, but it fell apart early when the Nets lost to the Celtics. But Drake hit big by betting $159,000 on the Warriors to win the 2022 Western conference. When they did, that earned him $800,000.<\/p>\n<p>Considering that this past May, Drake claimed to have cashed for more than $2.6 million on a parlay bet that had him picking winners for the Stanley Cup and NBA playoffs, it\u2019s easy to see him as a winner for this year. But those are only the bets that he wants us to see. And it doesn\u2019t include the $20 million he dropped, playing roulette on Twitch; although, the gambling was being done via Stake.com, a gambling site with which Drake has a sponsorship deal.<\/p>\n<p>As Krackomberger told The Post, \u201cEveryone loves bragging about sports bets, even if they are losing players in the end. They like showing wins and bad-beats [bets that they came close to winning but lost]. It\u2019s part of the human psyche and Drake\u2019s as susceptible to it as anyone.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Drake is a high-flying chart-topper among casino bosses.
