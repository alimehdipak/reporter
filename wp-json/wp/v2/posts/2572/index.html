Contract talks between the 29-year-old attacking midfielder and Manchester United were shelved in January, and amid reports of interest from AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain, West Ham United, Newcastle United Fulham all appear better placed to sign the England international.<\/p>\n<p><b>21.27 BST:<\/b> Juventus will need to make an offer with a transfer fee in the region of \u20ac30m for Sassuolo to allow <b>Giacomo Raspadori<\/b> to leave, reports Tuttosport. The <i>Bianconeri<\/i> are said to have the 22-year-old forward high on their shortlist as they look to make a number of signings in the summer, with Massimiliano Allegri looking to add a number of Italy internationals to his squad. The Serie A side are also keen on AS Roma midfielder <b>Nicolo Zaniolo<\/b>.<\/p>\n<p><b>20.54 BST:<\/b> Newcastle United are looking to prioritise a move for Everton forward <b>Dominic Calvert-Lewin<\/b>, writes Ekrem Konur. Eddie Howe&#8217;s side have been adding to their shortlist in recent weeks as they look to acquire a striker in the summer, and after it was reported recently that a deal for Benfica front man Darwin Nunez would be difficult to agree, it looks as though they have now set their sights on the 25-year-old England international.<\/p>\n<p><b>20.21 BST: Marcos Alonso<\/b> is ready to leave Chelsea in the summer, according to Fabrizio Romano, with the 31-year-old hopeful of returning to Spain. Barcelona reportedly have him on their shortlist as they look to add depth to the left-back position, and contact has already been initiated with the Blues over a potential move when the transfer window opens.<\/p>\n<p><b>19.48 BST:<\/b> Lazio are interested in signing Genoa defender <b>Johan Vasquez<\/b>, reports Gazzetta dello Sport. The <i>Biancocelesti<\/i> are looking to reinforce their defensive options in the summer as they prepare to part ways with a number of players, and they have identified the 23-year-old Mexico international as a potential solution.<\/p>\n<p><b>19.15 BST: Armando Broja<\/b> and <b>Levi Colwill<\/b> are expected to remain at Chelsea in the summer until the club&#8217;s future becomes more clear, according to the Sun.<\/p>\n<p>Broja, 20, has attracted interest from Premier League clubs after impressing during his loan spell with Southampton, but with Blues boss Thomas Tuchel unable to make any transfer moves before the club&#8217;s ownership situation is resolved, the Albania international striker could now be used in the squad next season. That looks to be the same for 19-year-old centre-back Colwill, who has been a standout performer in his loan spell for Championship club Huddersfield Town.<\/p>\n<p><b>18.37 BST: Paul Pogba<\/b> would prefer a move to Paris Saint-Germain over Real Madrid, writes Mundo Deportivo.

The 22-year-old midfielder has impressed in his 29 Ligue 1 games this season, and it is expected that he will sign a four-year extension at the Groupama Stadium despite previous links with Arsenal.<\/p>\n<p><b>17.00 BST: Takumi Minamino<\/b> could be set to leave Liverpool in the summer, writes Nicolo Schira. Despite impressive form in cup competitions that saw him contribute to five goals in five games, the 27-year-old forward has played just 89 minutes of Premier League football this season, having come on as a substitute in 10 matches. The Japan international was linked with a move away from the club during the January transfer window, although a transfer never materialised.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/i\/espn\/misc_logos\/500-dark\/transfers.png\" width=\"30\" \/><b>16.01 BST:<\/b> The Chicago Fire have announced the signing of twice-capped United States forward <b>Chris Mueller<\/b> from Scottish club Hibernian on a free transfer.

However, Dybala&#8217;s agent Jorge Antun has denied those reports and said: &#8220;The player is focused exclusively on the end of the season, on the tournament and on the Coppa Italia final.

I wouldn&#8217;t even call it wingers.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Two strikers and modern strikers, that do not necessarily have to be wingers. If you look into international football, there aren&#8217;t many top teams who still play with two strikers. Most play with either three strikers or a false No. 9.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/soccer\/blog-transfer-talk\/story\/4657908\/\" \/>play<\/p>\n<p>1:06<\/p>\n<p>Shaka Hislop discusses if Monday&#8217;s win over Brentford was Cristiano Ronaldo&#8217;s last game at Old Trafford with Manchester United.<\/p>\n<h2>PAPER GOSSIP (by Adam Brown)<\/h2>\n<p>&#8211; Cristiano Ronaldo is considering a summer move away from Manchester United with the Red Devils&#8217; failure to secure Champions League for next season all but certain, according to The Sun.

Nkunku has been linked with a whole host of top teams, including Manchester United, PSG, Bayern Munich and AC Milan, so he won&#8217;t be short of options should he depart.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Tottenham Hotspur have been given encouragement as \u20ac60m-rated centre-back Pau Torres has decided now is the time to leave Villarreal, according to The Daily Mail.
