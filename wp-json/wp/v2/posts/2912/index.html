While contemporaries such as Drake have had more hits, Lamar has earned mad respect as the most important rapper of his generation.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>On his ambitious new double LP \u2014 evenly split into two parts with nine tracks each \u2014 Lamar reflects on both the power and the pressures of his position. \u201cHeavy is the head that chose to wear the crown\/To whom is given much is required now,\u201d he raps on \u201cCrown.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Later, on the fame rumination \u201cSavior,\u201d he makes it clear\u00a0that he wasn\u2019t trying to strike a Jesus pose with that crown of thorns on the album cover: \u201cKendrick made you think about it, but he is not your savior.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Still, there is no doubt that, from \u201cGood Kid\u201d to 2015\u2019s \u201cTo Pimp a Butterfly\u201d to 2017\u2019s \u201cDamn\u201d to now \u201cMr. Morale\u201d\u00a0\u2014 not to mention 2018\u2019s \u201cBlack Panther\u201d soundtrack \u2014 Lamar has been the truth-telling voice and consciousness of hip-hop.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/mr-morale-the-big-steppers.jpeg?w=1024\" alt=\"Lamar wears a crown of thorns on the cover of his new album.\" \/>Lamar wears a crown of thorns on the cover of his new album.Image via pgLang\/Top Dawg Entert    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne of the most fascinating things about Lamar as this cultural icon is essentially he can do no wrong,\u201d Christopher Driscoll, co-author of 2019\u2019s \u201cKendrick Lamar and the Making of Black Meaning,\u201d told The Post. \u201cIt\u2019s worth us marking just how powerful his art is for so many people.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, even though it\u2019s been five years \u2014 an eternity in hip-hop \u2014 since his last studio album, Lamar remains at the top of the game on \u201cMr. Morale.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/kendrick-lamar-3.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"It's been 5 years since his last album dropped, but Lamar remains at the top of his game.\" \/>It\u2019s been 5 years since his last album dropped, but Lamar remains at the top of his game.AFP via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe is at the top of the heap as far as lyricists, as far as just emcees in general,\u201d said Driscoll. \u201cThere\u2019s no one better right now, and everybody knows it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After Lamar brought the Compton streets to gritty life on \u201cGood Kid,\u201d he was quickly anointed as the more soulful, spiritual heir to the Dr. Dre throne. In fact, that connection and evolution was showcased when K-Dot performed during this year\u2019s Super Bowl halftime show as part of what was essentially an all-star tribute to Dre.<\/p>\n<p>But it was with \u201cTo Pimp a Butterfly\u201d that Lamar took on even greater significance thanks to \u201cAlright,\u201d which became the anthem that the Black Lives Matter movement didn\u2019t even know it needed yet. \u201cThe folks on the ground, marching and doing things like that, find themselves with an anthem \u2026 that is just a product of his genius and his vulnerability,\u201d said Driscoll.<\/p>\n<p>And while Lamar famously rapped about being \u201cHumble\u201d on \u201cDamn,\u201d that album earned him bragging rights as the first rapper to win a Pulitzer Prize for music. Just as another Pulitzer Prize winner, Bob Dylan, did in the \u201960s, Lamar became the artist that reflected the times and the social change that needed to happen.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHis work is healing a lot of really deep wounds within the black community, within the broader American community and within the hip-hop community,\u201d said Driscoll, who is one of the academics who has even taught college courses on Lamar.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s no surprise that \u201cMr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers\u201d instantly became the most important album of 2022 \u2014 the kind that you will dissect in all of its lyrical detail as it gets in deeper and deeper with music that ranges from lushly soulful to hauntingly moody. Whether he\u2019s reflecting on the pandemic on \u201cN95\u201d and \u201cCount Me Out\u201d or black family issues on \u201cFather Time\u201d and \u201cMother I Sober,\u201d Lamar\u2019s voice matters.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a voice that Lamar uses to make a statement in support of the trans community on one of the album\u2019s highlights, \u201cAuntie Diaries.\u201d Against a chill, electro-infused groove, he raps about two trans family members who taught him to choose \u201chumanity over religion.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Given the homophobic history in hip-hop, it\u2019s a revelation \u2014 and a reminder of exactly why we need Lamar.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On the cover of his new album, \u201cMr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers\u201d \u2014 which dropped from the hip-hop heavens on Friday \u2014 Kendrick Lamar wears a crown of thorns while holding&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":2913,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[5],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2912"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/6"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2912"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2912\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2912"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2912"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2912"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
