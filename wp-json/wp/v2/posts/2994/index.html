Benedict\u2019s reagent starts out aqua-blue. As it is heated in the presence of reducing sugars, it turns yellow to orange. The \u201chotter\u201d the final color of the reagent, the higher the concentration of reducing sugar.<\/p>\n<h3>Which sugar gives positive Benedict\u2019s test?<\/h3>\n<p>The reducing sugars that show positive results with benedict\u2019s solution are glucose, fructose, maltose etc. The correct option is D i.e. sucrose. Additional Information: Sucrose is a disaccharide composed of two monosaccharide molecules that are glucose and fructose.<\/p>\n<p>What is Benedict test for glucose?<\/p>\n<p>Benedict\u2019s Test is used to test for simple carbohydrates. The Benedict\u2019s test identifies reducing sugars (monosaccharide\u2019s and some disaccharides), which have free ketone or aldehyde functional groups. Benedict\u2019s solution can be used to test for the presence of glucose in urine.<\/p>\n<p>Why is Benedict not exclusive to glucose?<\/p>\n<p>The Benedict test isn\u2019t specific for glucose; it just tells you if an aldehyde is present. So it will also give a positive test for other reducing sugars. In short, any sugar* (*mono- or disaccharide) with a hemiacetal will also give a positive test, since these sugars are in equilibrium with an open-chain aldehyde.<\/p>\n<p>Is Benedict test positive for fructose?<\/p>\n<p>Because both the Tollens\u2019 and Benedict\u2019s reagents are basic solutions, ketoses (such as fructose) also give positive tests due to an equilibrium that exists between ketoses and aldoses in a reaction known as tautomerism.<\/p>\n<h3>Does lactose give a positive Benedict test?<\/h3>\n<p>Lactose, D-ribose, and D-glyceraldehyde would give a positive Benedict\u2019s test. To be a reducing sugar, a disaccharide must contain an anomeric carbon atom that can open up to form an aldehyde functional group, as shown in this disaccharide (answers will vary).<\/p>\n<p>Which compound does not give Benedict Test?<\/p>\n<p>C6H5CHO is an aromatic aldehyde. It will not give Benedict test. Only aliphatic aldehyde give Benedict\u2019s test.<\/p>\n<p>Why sucrose gives a negative Benedict Test?<\/p>\n<p>Sucrose contains two sugars (fructose and glucose) joined by their glycosidic bond in such a way as to prevent the glucose isomerizing to aldehyde, or the fructose to \u03b1-hydroxy-ketone form. Sucrose is thus a non-reducing sugar, which does not react with Benedict\u2019s reagent.<\/p>\n<p>Which sugar is not a reducing sugar?<\/p>\n<p>Sucrose is a non-reducing sugar because<\/p>\n<p>The two monosaccharide units are held together by a glycosidic linkage between C1 of \u03b1-glucose and C2 of \u03b2-fructose. Since the reducing groups of glucose and fructose are involved in glycosidic bond formation, sucrose is a non-reducing sugar.<\/p>\n<h3>Why is Benedict Test semi quantitative?<\/h3>\n<p>As color of the obtained precipitate can be used to infer the quantity of sugar present in the solution, the test is semi-quantitative.<\/p>\n<p>What colour is glucose?<\/p>\n<p>Glucose forms white or colorless solids that are highly soluble in water and acetic acid but poorly soluble in methanol and ethanol.<\/p>\n<p>What type of sugar is lactose?<\/p>\n<p>Lactose is a sugar found in milk. It is a disaccharide made up of glucose and galactose units. It is broken down into the two parts by an enzyme called lactase. Once broken down, the simple sugars can be absorbed into the bloodstream.<\/p>\n<p>Is lactose a reducing sugar?<\/p>\n<p>For the same reason lactose is a reducing sugar. The free aldehyde formed by ring opening can react with Benedict\u2019s solution. Thus, a solution of lactose contains both the \u03b1 and \u03b2 anomer at the \u201creducing end\u201d of the disaccharide. Although the aglycone can be either \u03b1 or \u03b2, the glycosidic bond is always \u03b2 in lactose.<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In lab, we used Benedict\u2019s reagent to test for one particular reducing sugar: glucose.
