Hmmmm it\u2019s kind of nice I think?\u201d she wrote in text for the video as she shows her face with and without the filter.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWho cares might as well,\u201d she continued, as the clip cut to her with bleach applied to her brows.<\/p>\n<p>At first, she said, \u201cNo,\u201d declaring that she didn\u2019t like her new look, but she changed her mind once she applied makeup.<\/p>\n<p>Users in her comments said the look is a \u201cslay,\u201d while others asked how she achieved the ultimate blond brow.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOnly person I\u2019ve seen it look good on,\u201d one person wrote.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was scared for you at first but you rock that,\u201d complimented another.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNO BC ITS SO GOOD ACTUALLY I JUST DID THE SAMEEE THING,\u201d someone else excitedly wrote.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"580\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/bleach-tiktok-05.jpg?w=580\" alt=\"TikToker dyes eyebrows despite fans telling her it looks bad\" \/>Another user decided to dye her brows even though her followers urged her not to.@mikayla__matt    <\/p>\n<p>The brave blond look comes after ultra-thin, 1990s brows became all the rage earlier this year among A-listers \u2014 although the fashion veterans still recovering warned against irreversible over-plucking.<\/p>\n<p>At least hair dye is reversible?<\/p>\n<p>Other TikTokers have hopped on and mulled over the trend, whether playing around with the filter or mildly entertaining the thought of bleaching their own brows.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe urge to bleach my brows every time TikTok comes out with a new light eyebrow filter,\u201d the text read on one video posted by @zeececilia, which garnered 71,700 views.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"580\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/bleach-tiktok-07.jpg?w=580\" alt=\"TikToker dyes eyebrows brown\" \/>One user dyed her jet-black brows to a light brown instead of bleach blonde.@gemmagarc1a    <\/p>\n<p>But some didn\u2019t even pause to reconsider.<\/p>\n<p>TikToker @gemmagarc1a used box dye to drastically change her jet black brows to a light brown hue, while user @mikayla__matt dyed hers out of \u201cspite\u201d when her followers said she\u2019d look unappealing with bleached brows after trying out the filter.<\/p>\n<p>For user @soda.maillet, she wasn\u2019t so sure she\u2019d look good with the bleached brows since the TikTok filter alters users\u2019 facial structures.<\/p>\n<p>But eventually, she gave in.<\/p>\n<p>In a clip with over 342,100 views, she reached for a box of bleach and got to work.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s really cute,\u201d she admitted in a follow-up video. \u201cI think they suit my skin color nicer.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"580\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/bleach-tiktok-03.jpg?w=580\" alt=\"TikToker dyeing goes wrong\" \/>But not everyone\u2019s dyeing experience went smoothly. One user hated her yellow-tinted brows.@ellajajaja    <\/p>\n<p>In the clips, users mostly used at-home box dye or men\u2019s beard dye to change their brows\u2019 hue. While beard dye is meant for the face, putting bleach in contact with fine eyebrow hairs and delicate facial skin could cause an issue.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIngredients used to bleach the hair [that include] high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide can cause serious burns,\u201d Michelle Henry, a New York dermatologist, told Allure in 2019.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, one survey conducted by King Saud University in Saudi Arabia showed that eyebrow bleaching could lead to redness, itching and scaling of the skin, which appeared in more than 50% of the participants. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf the solution is too strong, brows and hair can be damaged,\u201d Henry also told Allure. \u201cSignificant burns can also cause permanent hair loss. Even when done appropriately, the process can dry and damage the hair, making it more prone to breakage.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But not everyone prefers blonds. User @ellajajaja made the mistake of believing she might look good with a bleached brow, but instead they ended up looking like straw.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is your sign to NOT bleach your brows because this filter \u2018looks good on you,&#8217;\u201d the text on her TikTok warned. The reveal clip, which earned 1.6 million views, was preceded by another with nearly 368,700 views, in which she showed her new look to her friends.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cElla, they look so bad dye them back,\u201d one girl in the video said, agreeing with the others who simply said, \u201cNo.\u201d (Save for one person, who said she was \u201cslaying.\u201d)<\/p>\n<p>Despite users in the comments telling her to tone them to be less yellow, she caved and used men\u2019s beard dye to turn them back to brown \u2014 yet somehow they looked better than before.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo this is my sign to bleach my eyebrows and dye them their original color?
