We know, from an opening flashback, that it was love at first sight when they met in a local bar as young adults, and nothing has changed: they still dote on each other \u2014 Franklin nursing Irene, a retired English teacher, as she recovers from a fall, and Irene worrying about Franklin\u2019s health, particularly his increasing lapses of memory (which leave him frustrated, but droll about his situation). They still mourn the death of their son, Michael, and often retreat to his room for solace.<\/p>\n<p>And \u2026 they\u2019re keeping a huge secret: the ramshackle, cluttered shed in their backyard leads to an underground chamber that transports them to a rocky planet light years away from Earth \u2014 where they sit and watch the wonders of space out of a huge window from the comfort of their easy chairs \u2026 and maybe have a cup of coffee or read a magazine. There\u2019s a door to the \u201cother side,\u201d but they never use it, not after Franklin once opened it and put some mice outside (it didn\u2019t end well for the critters).<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/night-sky-prime-video-10.jpg?w=1024\" \/>JK Simmons and Sissy Spacek in a scene from the Prime Video sci-fi series \u201cNight Sky.\u201dChuck Hodes\/Prime Video    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/night-sky-prime-video-2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Photo of Adam Bartley as Franklin and Irene's the nosy neighbor, Byron, who suspects something amiss.

She pays Franklin a surprise visit and tells him it\u2019s time for them to move to an assisted-living facility (not happening, he says). The situation takes a turn when Irene discovers an unconscious bearded young man, Jude (Chai Hansen), lying on the ground on the \u201cother side\u201d of the chamber. <\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in a remote town in Argentina, we meet the Calderons, mother Stella (Julieta Zylberberg) and her 15-year-old daughter, Toni (Rocio Herndanez), who can\u2019t understand why her mother is so devoted to their backyard church. There are good reasons for that, both godly otherworldly: Stella is hiding the fact that the church, like the York\u2019s shed in Illinois, has an underground chamber holding its own otherworldly secrets.<\/p>\n<p>And where does Jude fit into the puzzle?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNight Sky\u201d is an absorbing series with an interesting premise that marches to its own drummer in terms of its pacing and its plot revelations courtesy of writer\/co-producer Holden Miller (son of comedian Dennis Miller and Ali Espley). Spacek and Simmons are terrific and have nice onscreen chemistry; you can believe that Irene and Franklin are truly devoted to each other, whatever the circumstances, and they\u2019ll be put through their paces as the series ventures further into what lies beneath \u2014 or, in this case, what\u2019s \u201cout there\u201d in the universe.<\/p>\n<p>Check it out.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You can\u2019t go wrong with a project headlined by Oscar winners Sissy Spacek and JK Simmons \u2014 and they deliver the goods in \u201cNight Sky,\u201d a gripping, eight-episode sci-fi series premiering May&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":3055,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[5],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3054"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/6"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3054"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3054\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3054"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3054"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3054"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
