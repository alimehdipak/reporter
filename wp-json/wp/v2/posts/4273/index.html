The woman said Miller, who was wearing flip-flops, told her that they got the injuries from a fight. As she walked away \u2014 the woman claimed \u2014 she turned and joked, \u201cBut just so you know, I could take you in a fight.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Miller reportedly responded, \u201cYou really want to fight?\u201d and the woman told Miller to meet her in the smoking area in two minutes. Miller eventually met the woman outside of the bar \u2014 where the joke allegedly got physical. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s just fun and games \u2014 but then it wasn\u2019t,\u201d the woman said. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cAll of a sudden, [they\u2019re] on top of me, choking me, still screaming in my face if I want to fight. My friend who\u2019s filming sees [they\u2019re] obviously not joking and it\u2019s actually serious, so he stops filming, and pushes [Miller] off me as [they\u2019re] still trying to fight me,\u201d she recalled. \u201cTwo guy friends of mine are actually holding [Miller] back as [Miller\u2019s] screaming, \u2018This is what you wanted!

The pair had not seen each other since they reportedly had consensual sex in 2020. <\/p>\n<p>Nadia said Miller was \u201csuper nice and super polite\u201d until they started rolling a cigarette, which she told them they needed to take outside. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat just set them off,\u201d she claimed. \u201cI asked them to leave about 20 times, maybe more. They started insulting me. I\u2019m a \u2018transphobic piece of s \u2013 \u2013 t.\u2019 I\u2019m a \u2018Nazi.\u2019 <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt became so, so stressful for me,\u201d recalled Nadia, who also said she had informed Miller that she is a descendant of Holocaust survivors. \u201cThey were going around my house, looking at everything, touching everything, spreading tobacco leaves on the floor. It felt disgusting and very intrusive.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/ezra-miller-mugshot-hawaii-02.jpg?w=819\" alt=\"Ezra Miller mugshot\" \/>Ezra Miller\u2019s mugshot was taken after their March arrest for disorderly conduct and harassment after an incident at a bar in Hilo, Hawaii.Hawaii Police Department \/ BACKG    <\/p>\n<p>After about 30 minutes, she said Miller finally left once she called the police. While she didn\u2019t think the actor would sexually assault her that night, she believed they \u201ccould somehow attack me physically.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI totally felt unsafe,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>In April, Nadia filed a criminal complaint about the incident, according to Variety. Investigators were looking into a charge of trespassing against Miller, but the German state prosecutor\u2019s office in Berlin\u00a0said it had stopped its search since Miller had left the country.<\/p>\n<p>The Post has reached out for comment from representatives for Miller. <\/p>\n<p>In March, Miller was arrested at a bar in Hawaii for disorderly conduct and harassment. Less than four weeks later, they were arrested in the Aloha State for second-degree assault.<\/p>\n<p>Miller has since been accused of grooming a number of youngsters, including Gibson Iron Eyes, who reportedly changed their name and uses she\/they pronouns.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking to The Post\u00a0earlier this month, Gibson\u2019s mom, Sara Jumping Eagle, said Miller has \u201cbrainwashed\u201d her child.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not letting Tokata or the other girls bathe or wear makeup,\u201d Jumping Eagle claimed, referring to the child by their birth name.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey have to ask his permission. It\u2019s an R. Kelly-type situation and it\u2019s very scary,\u201d she added, referring to the singer turned convicted sex offender.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, a mother and nonbinary child from Massachusetts also got a protection order against the star after the family\u00a0claimed the actor menaced them.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this month, Rolling Stone also published another report alleging that Miller is housing a mother and her young children at their Vermont farm. The kids\u2019 father is reportedly worried for their safety, while the mother claims Miller is keeping them safe because, she says, the dad is abusive.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt seems to be a pattern,\u201d Nadia told Variety about the worldwide allegations against Miller. \u201cThey jet-set abuse.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/ezra-miller.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Ezra Miller on red carpet\" \/>Ezra Miller has a slew of abuse and misconduct allegations leveled against them.
