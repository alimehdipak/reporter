The 2021 season was especially trying, however, as Kershaw fought soreness around his left elbow and forearm that forced him to miss most of the second half and kept him from participating in the postseason.<\/p>\n<p>The Dodgers are cautiously optimistic that Kershaw, 33, will be at full health but will know more once he goes through a physical examination.<\/p>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p>If healthy, Kershaw slots near the top of a rotation that is also headlined by Walker Buehler and Julio Urias. Tony Gonsolin, David Price and Andrew Heaney, signed to a one-year deal in November, make up the rest of the staff, with uncertainty still lingering around Trevor Bauer, who was placed back on administrative leave now that the lockout has ended.<\/p>\n<p>Kershaw was arguably the greatest pitcher of the 2010s, averaging 16 wins and 200 innings while posting a 2.31 ERA and recording five times as many strikeouts as walks from 2010 to 2019. Injuries, most notably to his back, continually limited him, ultimately dropping his fastball velocity into the lower 90s. But Kershaw still frequently sported some of the lowest ERAs in the sport.<\/p>\n<p><img data-src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2021\/1123\/r941462_608x342_16-9.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2021\/1123\/r941462_608x342_16-9.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The hot stove has been relit!
