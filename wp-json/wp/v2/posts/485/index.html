It is why this population was one of the first to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. However, while clinical trials showed vaccination could prevent infection or lessen the risk of severe illness in healthy individuals, it was unclear if those considered immunocompromised would have a similar response. Moffitt Cancer Center researchers quickly put together one of the largest observational studies to date to answer that question. Their results were published today in <em>JAMA Oncology.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The study, led by Drs. Anna R. Giuliano, Shari Pilon-Thomas and Jeffrey E. Lancet, followed 515 patients with varying cancers. The goal was to evaluate if patients had an immune response to the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine and if that response differed by diagnosis and treatment.<\/p>\n<p>Patients provided blood samples before their first and second doses of the vaccine and again one month later. Each sample was tested for COVID-19 antibodies. For comparison, antibody levels were measured for 18 healthy adults receiving the mRNA-1273 vaccine.<\/p>\n<p>The results showed that most cancer patients had seroconverted, meaning they developed antibodies after receiving the vaccine. Overall, 71.3% of patients seroconverted after the first dose, 90.3% after the second. There were, however, differences among cancer types. Patients with blood cancers had lower seroconversion rates when compared to those with solid tumors, 84.7% versus 98.1%.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Although we did see higher seroconversion rates among solid tumor patients, it is important to point out the antibody titers were lower than seen in healthy adults. Unfortunately, we don&#8217;t know how much antibody a person needs to provide full protection against the virus,&#8221; said Giuliano, founding director of the Center for Immunization and Infection Research in Cancer at Moffitt.<\/p>\n<p>Blood cancer patients with lymphoid disease, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, had the lowest seroconversion rates. And patients with those diseases who were on active treatment fared even worse.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This finding was to be expected. Lymphoid disease affects B cells, which your immune system needs to make antibodies. If a patient&#8217;s B cells are suppressed, either through the disease process itself or treatment, chances are low they would be able to make antibodies,&#8221; said Lancet, chair of the Malignant Hematology Department at Moffitt.<\/p>\n<p>Lancet said certain treatments also had an impact on seroconversion. Patients who received anti-CD20 antibodies within six months of vaccination had no immune response. And those treated with BTK inhibitors, Venetoclax and CD19 targeted CAR T-cell therapy had the lowest seroconversion rates.<\/p>\n<p>The researchers are continuing to follow study participants, taking blood samples at six, 12 and 24 months. The team has also launched a companion study evaluating immune response in cancer patients following a third dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine.<\/p>\n<p>Their work is supported by the National Cancer Institute (P30CA076292), the state of Florida (MOD17) and the Investigator-Initiated Studies Program of Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp.<\/p>\n<p> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedaily.com\/releases\/2022\/03\/220310143730.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cancer patients who have compromised immune systems due to their disease or therapy remain at high risk for COVID-19 infection.
