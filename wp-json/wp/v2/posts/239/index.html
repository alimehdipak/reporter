mission have been cleared to roll out to the launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.<\/p>\n<p>NASA\u2019s\u00a02022 mission to the moon is called Artemis 1.<\/p>\n<p>It will be testing out hardware so that NASA can land the first woman and the first person of color on the moon by 2025.<\/p>\n<p>That crewed mission is being referred to as Artemis 3 and a lot has to happen before it can take place.<\/p>\n<p>Before Artemis 1 can launch, NASA wants to test all the components.<\/p>\n<p>All the major pieces should all be at the launch pad on March 17.<\/p>\n<p>Artemis 1 isn\u2019t a crewed mission but it needs to loop around the moon to test three key components.<\/p>\n<p>These are NASA\u2019s Space Launch System (SLS), its Orion spacecraft, and the European Service Module (ESM).<\/p>\n<p>The Orion spacecraft and the ESM should get within 62 miles of the lunar surface and then travel 40,000 miles beyond this.<\/p>\n<p>It will take about three weeks for it to complete the mission and land in the Pacific Ocean off San Diego.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\"

for the wet dress rehearsal to see how we\u2019re doing \u2026 we\u2019ll set the launch date at that point.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe continue to evaluate the May launch window, but we recognize that there\u2019s a lot of work in front of us and we need to make sure we get through that testing and evaluation activity before we set a launch commitment date.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\"

Vehicle Assembly Building and a launch date will finally be set.<\/p>\n<p>This could be almost any time in May, June or early July.<\/p>\n<p>It all depends on weather conditions and where the moon is
