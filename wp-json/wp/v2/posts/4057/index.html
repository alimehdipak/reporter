I also find my ideas need time to naturally develop. When I\u2019m trying too hard to think of ideas I get a creative block. Instead of pushing too hard to find the next project, giving myself the space to allow ideas to grow often creates the best outcome.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So instead of idea-cramming just before Valentine\u2019s Day or other holidays, Francesca saves ideas throughout the year as they come to her. \u201cI use list apps on my phone. I use these to take pictures or save links, describe my initial thoughts or ideas and set reminders for when I think it might be useful. This works really well for me, but you might like to set up your own way of keeping your inspiration saved for later.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Find inspiration in your passions<\/h3>\n<p>Kathy Cano-Murillo, aka <a href=\"https:\/\/craftychica.com\/\">The Crafty Chica<\/a>, started blogging 20 years ago as a way to share scenes from her life as an entertainment reporter, craft maker, band wife and mom. Over time, the blog became less of a diary, and more of a hub for Kathy to share her Latinocentric craft tutorials. A third-generation Mexican American, Kathy takes pride in representing and connecting with her heritage through her art, and inspiring other creative people from all cultures to do the same.<\/p>\n<p>Now a full-time creator, Kathy has authored 12 books; created multiple product lines; hosts craft retreats; and works for hire as a consultant, brand ambassador and storytelling coach.
