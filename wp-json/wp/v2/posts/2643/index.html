Inductees are recognized for their popularity and influence on the video game industry or pop culture over time.<\/p>\n<p>The Ms. Pac-Man arcade game was released in 1981 as Midway\u2019s follow-up to Pac-Man, which\u00a0entered the hall as part of the inaugural class in 2015.\u00a0The Pac-Man sequel reimagined the main character to acknowledge the original game\u2019s female fans, according to the hall. After selling 125,000 cabinets within the first five years, it became one of the best-selling arcade games of all time.<\/p>\n<p>There was nothing inherently gendered about early video games, said Julia Novakovic, senior archivist at the hall. But \u201cby offering the first widely recognized female video game character,\u201d she said, \u201cMs. Pac-Man represented a turn in the cultural conversation about women\u2019s place in the arcade, as well as in society at large.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/ms-pac-man-02.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Ms. Pac-Man\" \/>Video Game Hall of Fame senior archivist Julia Novakovic called Ms. Pac-Man \u201cthe first widely recognized female video game character.\u201dMediaNews Group via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>The Class of 2022 was chosen from a field of finalists that also included Assassin\u2019s Creed, Candy Crush Saga, Minesweeper, NBA Jam, PaRappa the Rapper, Resident Evil, Rogue, and Words with Friends. It is the eighth class to be inducted since the World Video Game Hall of Fame was established at The Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, New York.<\/p>\n<p>Konami\u2019s Dance Dance Revolution, first seen in arcades in Japan in 1998, was recognized for helping to pave the way for other music-centered games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band. The fast-paced game put players on a dance floor with a screen in front to direct their moves.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMusic has been an integral part of human life since prehistoric times, so it comes as no surprise that DDR enjoyed a unique popularity that spanned ages, genders, and regions,\u201d said video game curator Lindsey Kurano.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/ddr.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Dance Dance Revolution\" \/>Konami\u2019s Dance Dance Revolution was also inducted and lauded for helping pave the way for other music-themed games.Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>A home version of the game followed on the Sony PlayStation in 1999.<\/p>\n<p>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, also first released in 1998, came out for the Nintendo 64 gaming console and defined what a 3D action video game could be, Hall of Fame officials said. The award-winning game sold more than 7.6 million copies worldwide and continues to be recognized by some players and critics as one of the best video games ever made.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEven today, developers throughout the world credit The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time as influencing the way they create games,\u201d digital games curator Andrew Borman said. \u201cThe game\u2019s sprawling 3D world, fluid combat, complex puzzles and time-shifting story combined to inspire a wonder in players that they have never forgotten.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization, released in 1991, was recognized as an influential simulation and strategy game. The game, which invited players to develop their own empires, launched a series of successor games, including the most recent Civilization: Beyond Earth and Civilization VI.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/zelda.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Legend of Zelda\" \/>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time was inducted as well. Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe addictive nature of the game, which creator Sid Meier himself called the \u2018one more turn\u2019 quality, and its nearly unlimited choices that prevented repetitive gameplay, earned Civilization recognition from Computer Gaming World as the best video game of all time in 1996,\u201d said Jon-Paul Dyson, director of The Strong\u2019s International Center for the History of Electronic games. \u201cAltogether \u2014 and given the extraordinarily long periods of play the game afforded \u2014 players have engaged with the Civilization series for more than a billion hours.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Anyone can nominate a game for the World Video Game Hall of Fame.
