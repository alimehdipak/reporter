Laura\u2019s murderer is finally revealed as her father Leland Palmer (Ray Wise) who has been possessed by Bob ever since he was a kid. Leland kills himself in jail, which then frees Bob to find another host.<\/p>\n<p>In Part 18, he also repeats his instructions to Cooper when he returns to the Black Lodge. Due to time alterations following Part 17, it is said that Leland committed suicide on February 24, 1990, one year after his daughter\u2019s disappearance (she was never confirmed to have been murdered in the changed timeline).<\/p>\n<p>Wise went on to explain that three versions of Maddy\u2019s death were actually shot. One with BOB, who was played by Frank Silva, as the killer, one with Ben Horne, and one with Leland. But Leland was the real killer. \u201cI was momentarily shattered by it, because I didn\u2019t want to leave town,\u201d Wise added.<\/p>\n<p>He took Laura and Ronette to a train car, where he murdered Laura, begging BOB to not make him do it. He wrapped her body in plastic and sent her along the river. He then went to the Black Lodge, where Mike demanded his garmonbozia. BOB pulled the blood from Leland\u2019s shirt and threw it on the ground.<\/p>\n<p>His death scene suggests that he was completely unaware of the things BOB made him do, yet in the train car in FWWM he says \u201cI always thought you knew it was me\u201d, followed by BOB then saying \u201cI never knew you knew it was me\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>WHY DOES LELAND\u2019S HAIR TURN WHITE OVERNIGHT IF HE\u2019S NOT POSSESSED BY A DEMON? At the start of the second season, Leland\u2019s hair suddenly turns white. His final act as a sentient human was killing Jacques Renault, and his white hair is supposed to signal that his demonic transformation is complete.<\/p>\n<p>He taunted Leland, asking \u201cdo you wanna play with fire, little boy?\u201d BOB told Leland that he wanted to play, and then \u201copened\u201d Leland and went inside him.<\/p>\n<p>There is no secrecy involved which eradicates the shame real-world Laura experiences. Emboldened, doppelg\u00e4nger Laura charges toward Cooper as she unleashes a set of wailing screams indicating she is running full throttle toward acknowledging what Laura has endured.<\/p>\n<p>Doppelgangers were evil counterparts of individuals, originating from the Black Lodge. During his time in the Black Lodge, Dale Cooper encountered doppelgangers of Laura Palmer, Leland Palmer, the arm, Annie Blackburn, Maddy Ferguson, Caroline Earle, and himself.<\/p>\n<p>The doppelganger of Agent Dale Cooper, also known as Mr. C, is a major antagonist in Twin Peaks and the main antagonist of the 2017 revival series of the same name. He is a Black Lodge entity created by Killer BOB, who used the doppelganger to escape the lodge and go on the run for the next 25-years.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEpisode 14\u201d, also known as \u201cLonely Souls\u201d, is the seventh episode of the second season of the American mystery television series Twin Peaks.<\/p>\n<p>Many viewers tuned out after discovering in the middle of season 2 that Laura\u2019s father, Leland Palmer, killed Laura while he was possessed by the evil spirit known as Killer BOB.<\/p>\n<p>The show began with the discovery of the body of a murdered teenage prom queen, Laura Palmer (played by Sheryl Lee), in the small town of Twin Peaks, Washington, near the Canadian border and revolved around the ensuing murder investigation led by Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan), an idiosyncratic FBI special agent sent to<\/p>\n<p>Set and filmed in the outskirts of greater Seattle, the world of Twin Peaks remains largely intact, surprisingly accessible and still majestically creepy. A visitor lies next to the log at Kiana Lodge where the body of high school homecoming queen Laura Palmer is discovered in Twin Peaks.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Leland as Bob murders Laura\u2019s twin-like cousin Maddy Ferguson (also played by Sheryl Lee).
