Reporters interviewed 20 of the late musician\u2019s friends for the piece.<\/p>\n<p>The end result heavily focused on Hawkins mental struggles and desire to take a step back from the band because of its upcoming rigorous tour schedule. <\/p>\n<p>Hawkins\u2019 family and Foo Fighters bandmates had declined to partake in the interviews. But Cameron, 59, apparently had plenty to share about the fellow drummer\u2019s state of mind before his passing on March 25 at age 50. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe had a heart-to-heart with Dave and, yeah, he told me that he \u2018couldn\u2019t f \u2013 \u2013 king do it anymore\u2019 \u2014 those were his words,\u201d Cameron told Rolling Stone. \u201cSo I guess they did come to some understanding, but it just seems like the touring schedule got even crazier after that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Cameron \u2014 who collaborated with Hawkins on his Nighttime Boogie Association side project \u2014 said he wishes he hadn\u2019t participated in the story, either.  <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I agreed to take part in the Rolling Stone article about Taylor, I assumed it would be a celebration of his life and work,\u201d\u00a0he wrote on Instagram. \u201cMy quotes were taken out of context and shaped into a narrative I never intended. Taylor was a dear friend, and a next level artist.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Smith, 60, joined the fray on Wednesday, saying his comments were \u201csensationalized\u201d in what he assumed would be more \u201cloving tribute.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He continued in an emotional Instagram post: \u201cI was asked by\u00a0<em>Rolling Stone<\/em>\u00a0to share some memories of our time together, which I thought was going to be a loving tribute he deserved. Instead, the story they wrote was sensationalized and misleading, and had I known I would have never agreed to participate.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI miss him,\u201d fellow musician Cameron added about Hawkins. \u201cI have only the deepest love and respect for Taylor, Dave and the Foo Fighters families. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI am truly sorry to have taken part in this interview and I apologize that my participation may have caused harm to those for whom I have only the deepest respect  and admiration.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Post has reached out to Rolling Stone for comment. <\/p>\n<p>A rep for the Foo Fighters had told the magazine that the band \u201cdisputes Hawkins\u2019 friends\u2019 characterizations of how he was feeling.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"710\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/GettyImages-147582786.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Matt Cameron (left) and Taylor Hawkins\" \/>Matt Cameron (left) and Taylor Hawkins joined forces for the side project Nighttime Boogie Association.WireImage    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/cameron-hawkins-572.jpg?w=682\" alt=\"Taylor Hawkins smiling\" \/>Results of Hawkins\u2019 autopsy have not been made public, but a urine-analysis report supposedly found marijuana, antidepressants, benzodiazepines and opioids in his system, according to Rolling Stone.WireImage<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Drummers Matt Cameron and Chad Smith \u2014 of Pearl Jam and Red Hot Chili Peppers, respectively \u2014\u00a0now say quotes in a Rolling Stone article about their longtime friend Taylor Hawkins were \u201ctaken&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":3084,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[5],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3083"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/6"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3083"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3083\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3083"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3083"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3083"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
