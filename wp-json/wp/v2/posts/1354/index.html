Facebook    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you see a loss of over $230 billion in February, that shakes up everybody, and that should be a sign that it\u2019s time for change,\u201d O\u2019Connell said.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The first resolution, which SumOfUs is pushing alongside shareholders Harrington Investments and the Park Foundation, calls for an outside assessment of Meta\u2019s Audit and Risk Oversight Committee, a board the company created in 2020 that is supposedly independent from Zuckerberg and makes decisions about content moderation issues such as\u00a0former President Donald Trump\u2019s ban\u00a0from Facebook and Instagram.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a real concern that given the amount of problems we\u2019ve seen with the company, that the committee is not managing the company\u2019s behavior and performance very well,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. \u201cWe would like to see an independent analysis of how that committee is functioning.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The second resolution sounds the alarm about \u201cpotential psychological and civil and human rights harms\u201d associated with Zuckerberg\u2019s metaverse push.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The proposal is supported by SumOfUs alongside responsible investment fund Arjuna Capital, investor advisory group SHARE and Storebrand, a Norwegian asset manager that manages more than $100 billion.<\/p>\n<p>The groups want Meta to commission an outside audit of the metaverse\u2019s potential risks \u2014 such as the potential for harassment and hate speech, as well as privacy concerns \u2014 then seek a shareholder vote to gauge whether investors support the project.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMeta has been unable to manage its problems here now in the world where we\u2019re all living, so it\u2019s pretty shocking that they want to move into a more complex platform such as the metaverse,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. \u201cHarms to children, harassment, hate speech \u2014 that all becomes amplified when you start moving into the metaverse.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/mark-zuckerberg-facebook.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Mark Zuckerberg\" \/>Mark Zuckerberg can effectively veto shareholder resolutions due to his \u201csupervoting\u201d shares. Getty Images for SXSW    <\/p>\n<p>Meta\u2019s board has urged shareholders to vote against both resolutions, calling them \u201cunnecessary.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Meta\u2019s unconventional ownership structure allows Zuckerberg to effectively veto any shareholder attempt to change the company\u2019s operations. His stake in Meta is composed largely of \u201csupervoting\u201d shares, allowing him to control roughly 58% of votes when the company considers shareholder proposals. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Nonetheless, O\u2019Connell argues that shareholder action is still one of the best ways to push Zuckerberg to change his ways.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The resolutions were included in Meta\u2019s proxy statement, which was sent to shareholders on Friday. <\/p>\n<p>Shareholders will now submit votes on the resolutions ahead of Meta\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, which is set for May 25. Backers of the proposals will be allowed to speak at the virtual meeting and the results of the vote will be announced afterward.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEven when shareholder resolutions don\u2019t win the majority, they do have influence in the board and in management and also notify the broader public that shareholders are worried about what\u2019s going on,\u201d O\u2019Connell said.\u00a0\u201cWe want to see real corporate governance. We want to see competent management of this company.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Asked for comment on the resolutions, a Meta spokesperson said, \u201cWe value the views of our investors and\u00a0 regularly engage\u00a0with them to get their perspective.
