In the early \u201970s, the Israeli had flown to the Big Apple with less than $100 in his pocket. He first slept at the YMCA for $2 a night. When he ran out of money, he slept on a bench in Central Park. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t feel it was dangerous \u2014 nobody attacks a little homeless kid,\u201d Tahari says in \u201cThe United States of Elie Tahari,\u201d premiering at the Brklyn Film Festival this weekend. <\/p>\n<p>The new doc traces his journey from poverty-stricken kid to self-made fashion mogul who built a business off a humble tube top.

He was born in a refugee camp and lived in a metal-sheet house with no electricity, running water or indoor bathroom.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe other kids used to make jokes out of me because my clothes were dirty and wrinkled,\u201d Tahari, 70, says in the movie.<\/p>\n<p>But clothing was in his blood. His father was a fabric salesman, and his mother sewed his outfits. As a teen, Tahari entered the Israeli Air Force, where he became a mechanic. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/elie-tahari-10.jpg?w=682\" alt=\"Elie Tahari with actress Katie Holmes at his Summer 2020 runway show.\" \/>Elie Tahari with actress Katie Holmes at his Summer 2020 runway show.Getty Images For Elie Tahari    <\/p>\n<p>When he returned home in his uniform, his father told him, \u201cWe don\u2019t have room for you \u2014 we are too many,\u201d Tahari recalls. He went to his one-bedroom apartment and \u201ccried for two days.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>His brother worked for El Al Air and flew free, so Tahari fudged the first initial on a ticket \u2014 from his brother\u2019s first initial of \u201cA\u201d to an \u201cE\u201d \u2014 and set off for the Big Apple.<\/p>\n<p>After scrubbing cars, he landed a gig in the Garment District changing light bulbs in fashion houses.

One day, Tahari had an apparel epiphany: an elastic, one-size-fits-all, strapless top that a woman could wear outside at the pool or beach.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith the tube top, it was a natural thing,\u201d Tahari says of his now ubiquitous invention. \u201cWomen in the \u201970s, when the hippie movement started, they let it all hang out. They didn\u2019t want to wear bra.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>He brought about a dozen tube tops to his boss. \u201cI put [them] on the counter and a couple of customers came and started fighting over them.\u201d Soon, the budding designer had his own business. \u201cIt just took off.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/elie-tahari-13.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Elie Tahari is interviewed at New York Fashion Week.\" \/>Elie Tahari is interviewed at New York Fashion Week.Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>A self-proclaimed \u201cnight owl\u201d and avid roller skater, he held his first fashion show at Studio 54. Naturally, it featured flowy disco-inspired clothes. In the 1980s, as women entered the work force in droves, Tahari pivoted to the power suit, pioneering tailored, feminine versions of the men\u2019s office staple. In 1989, he opened a shop in Bloomingdale\u2019s on the designer floor; more followed. <\/p>\n<p>In the movie, Miller notes that Tahari is a \u201cmaster tailor.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHis jackets were exquisite,\u201d she says, recalling one she bought in the 1980s. \u201cIt was plaid with puff shoulders . . . I always got tons of compliments on it. I wore it forever.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Later, Tahari helped launch Theory and created a lower-priced line of suits that made his clothing available to a wider audience. In 2014, he designed a capsule collection for Kohl\u2019s.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/elie-tahari-9.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Elie Tahari and Christie Brinkley close out his show in 2019.\" \/>Elie Tahari and Christie Brinkley close out his show in 2019.Getty Images for NYFW: The Shows    <\/p>\n<p>The married father of two still shows at New York Fashion Week \u2014 in 2019, Christie Brinkley and her daughter Sailor Brinkley-Cook walked his runway \u2014 and he credits the United States for allowing him to fulfill his dreams.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c[The American flag] is a symbol of the free world.
