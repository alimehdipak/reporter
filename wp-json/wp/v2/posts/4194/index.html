He was also named to the All-NBA first team as he played for a Suns team that finished with a league-leading 64-18 record.<\/p>\n<p>It was by making the All-NBA team this past season that Booker qualified to receive the supermax from the Suns this offseason.<\/p>\n<p>Phoenix then saw its season come to a disappointing conclusion with a rout at the hands of the Dallas Mavericks on Phoenix&#8217;s home court in Game 7 of the Western Conference semifinals.<\/p>\n<p>Now, the Suns are hoping to begin turning things back in a positive direction this offseason. With Booker&#8217;s extension all set, Phoenix&#8217;s attention will turn to figuring out the future of starting center Deandre Ayton, who is a restricted free agent, and the potential extension status of forward Cam Johnson.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the Suns are among the teams Brooklyn Nets star Kevin Durant has on his wish list after requesting to be traded Thursday, sources told Wojnarowski.<\/p>\n<p>After Phoenix hadn&#8217;t won more than 39 games through Booker&#8217;s first six NBA seasons, the Suns have now gone a combined 115-39 over the past two years, including the first NBA finals appearance for the organization since Charles Barkley led Phoenix there in 1993.<\/p>\n<p>The Suns will hope for continued growth from Booker, who has blossomed into one of the league&#8217;s elite guards during his eight seasons in the Valley of the Sun &#8212; and, specifically, over the past two seasons playing alongside Paul.<\/p>\n<p>Booker, who had scored 70 points in a game in Boston earlier in his career, had several massive games during Phoenix&#8217;s playoff run two seasons ago, including scoring 47 to close out the Los Angeles Lakers on the road in Game 6 of the first round of those playoffs and back-to-back 40-point games against Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks in the NBA finals.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jul 1, 2022Tim BontempsESPN Phoenix Suns star Devin Booker has agreed on a four-year, $224 million supermax extension, his agents, Jessica Holtz and Melvin Booker of CAA Basketball, told ESPN&#8217;s Adrian Wojnarowski.Booker&#8217;s deal, agreed to early Friday, begins in 2024-25 and brings his total contract value to six years and $295 million.Booker, 25, has become&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":4195,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[13],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4194"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4194"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4194\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4194"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4194"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4194"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
