Both my parents were immigrants. My father was from Spain, and my mother was from Ireland,\u201d Sheen said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy father was very practical. He was a factory worker for most of his adult life, and he wanted me to go to college and improve my chances of making a better living than he did. We had some very, very painful confrontations about it,\u201d the \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d icon went on.<\/p>\n<p>Sheen\u2019s sons, \u201cBreakfast Club\u201d actor Emilio Estevez and Ramon Estevez, are both actors and chose not to Anglicize their names for the biz.

I was so self-involved and trying to be a provider that I wasn\u2019t aware of their inclination to being actors.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was doing a show one time, and\u00a0Emilio\u00a0showed up.
