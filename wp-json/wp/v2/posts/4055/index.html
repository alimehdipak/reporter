Mixon was one of the most productive players at this position, earned his first Pro Bowl selection and even threw a touchdown pass in the Bengals\u2019 first Super Bowl appearance in 33 years.<\/p>\n<p>Yet the lingering question about Mixon\u2019s capability as an all-purpose back still remains. Ever since he dazzled catching passes during his college days at Oklahoma, his status as a receiver has been a hot topic among fans and especially fantasy football managers.<\/p>\n<p>But the numbers from Mixon\u2019s 2021 season and comments from Bengals coach Zac Taylor suggest the question has already been answered.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTo make a statement that we can get more out of Joe [Mixon] in the passing game, that&#8217;s got to pull from somewhere,\u201d Taylor said on May 31 following an offseason workout. \u201cThen we&#8217;ll be talking about why there wasn&#8217;t as much production from Ja&#8217;Marr [Chase] or Tee [Higgins].\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Taylor hints at the conundrum the Bengals happily put themselves in when they drafted the two wide receivers in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Between them, veteran wide receiver Tyler Boyd and recently-departed tight end C.J. Uzomah, finding the right balance for ball distribution was going to be challenging.<\/p>\n<p><img data-src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0512\/nfl_post_draft_power_rankings_cr_16x9_608x342.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0512\/nfl_post_draft_power_rankings_cr_16x9_608x342.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Ahead of NFL training camps, we project the final 53-man rosters for all 32 teams. <b>Projections<\/b> \u00bb<br \/>\u2022 <b>Full 2022 schedule<\/b> | <b>Depth charts<\/b>  \u00bb<br \/>\u2022 <b>Transactions<\/b> | <b>Injuries<\/b> | <b>More NFL \u00bb<\/b><\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>In 2021, Cincinnati aced it. Chase set the franchise record for receiving yards in a single season (1,455) and was named the Associated Press NFL Rookie of the Year. Higgins cleared the 1,000-yard mark, too. Uzomah posted a career year that earned him a three-year, $24 million contract from the New York Jets.<\/p>\n<p>Mixon was more productive than all of them.<\/p>\n<p>He rushed for a career-high 1,205 yards, the third-highest in the NFL last season. Tack on his totals from the passing game and Mixon finished the year with 1,519 yards from scrimmage and 16 total offensive touchdowns, putting him fourth among all NFL running backs in each respective category.<\/p>\n<p>But the bulk of that damage was done on the ground. He ranked 18th among running backs in receiving yards and 25th in total targets.<\/p>\n<p>Being on the field in more passing situations, specifically on third downs, could increase Mixon\u2019s potential target share. But Mixon\u2019s current usage makes that a tricky situation.<\/p>\n<p>Last season, Mixon was on the field for 64% of Cincinnati&#8217;s total team snaps, which was the fourth-highest among all running backs, according to NFL Next Gen Stats. And the large majority of those snaps came during a fresh set of downs.<\/p>\n<p>Mixon was on the field for 75% of the team\u2019s first and second downs while Samaje Perine, the team\u2019s second-string running back, had a 16% snap share in those circumstances. But on third downs of three or more yards, those numbers flipped. Perine received 64% of the snaps while Mixon\u2019s share dropped to 17%.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/blog\/cincinnati-bengals\/post\/_\/id\/33995\/\" \/>Joe Mixon hasn&#8217;t been much of a factor in the Bengals passing game, causing fans and fantasy managers to wonder about his ability to be an all-purpose back.\u00a0AP Photo\/Bryan Woolston<\/p>\n<p>After the 2020 season, the coaching staff challenged Mixon to improve in his pass protection after the Bengals released veteran Giovani Bernard. Even though Mixon made strides in that area, Perine effectively took over for Bernard in most passing situations, including 2-minute drills.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going to take [Mixon] out on a down, I rather take him out on third down so he\u2019s good for first and second down, ultimately,\u201d said Bengals offensive coordinator Brian Callahan.<\/p>\n<p>The current structure leaves Mixon off the field in some potential high-leverage situations, such as a key third-and-1 late in Super Bowl LVI where Perine was stopped for no gain. Callahan seemed to suggest there was room for some flexibility in \u201922 that allows for Mixon to see more third-down snaps while balancing his overall workload.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re never going to have him take that many snaps, especially if you want to keep him fresh over the course of the season,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, I\u2019d like to see maybe a little bit more usage for him on third down.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Mixon&#8217;s thoughts on the topic are unclear. He did not speak to reporters following Super Bowl LVI and did not hold any press conferences during the team\u2019s offseason workouts.<\/p>\n<p>But Mixon\u2019s body of work during the first five years of his career speaks volumes. Last year\u2019s numbers provided strong early returns on the four-year, $48 million contract extension he signed in 2020. And he\u2019s fit into an offense that could be poised for a big season in 2022.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>CINCINNATI &#8212; Last season should have answered any questions about Joe Mixon\u2019s ability to be one of the NFL\u2019s best running backs.His fifth season with the Cincinnati Bengals was his best to date.
