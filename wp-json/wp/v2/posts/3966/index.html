It will be the first World Cup hosted by more than one nation since 2002, when Japan and South Korea shared the honors, and it&#8217;ll be the first World Cup with three hosts. Mexico will make history as the first nation to host or co-host for a third time (following 1970 and 1986), the U.S. will be second-time hosts (following 1994), and it will be Canada&#8217;s first time hosting the men&#8217;s tournament, having been the site of the Women&#8217;s World Cup in 2015.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, it will be the first World Cup to boast 48 qualified teams following FIFA&#8217;s vote in 2017 to expand the field from 32 sides, which had been the standard since France 1998. In this new format, 16 groups of three teams will compete with the top two teams from each group advancing to a Round of 32, which will be single elimination all the way through to the final.<\/p>\n<p>All in all, 80 matches will be spread across the 20 venues, with the U.S. hosting 60 games &#8212; including the quarterfinals, semifinals and final &#8212; and Mexico\/Canada each taking 10 matches.

The MLS side has only seen its status as the best-attended team in the league threatened during recent years of expansion, though Lumen Field continues to remain one of the most boisterous and best-attended stadiums in MLS. The open-air stadium has a partial roof that covers 70% of seats and traps in noise.<\/p>\n<p>Lumen Field is close to downtown and easy to get to, walkable from Amtrak&#8217;s King Street Station and stops along Seattle&#8217;s Sound Transit rail system. A trip from the stadium to Seattle&#8217;s famous Pike Place Market is only about 20 minutes by public transportation, 26 minutes on foot and 10 minutes by car (if traffic isn&#8217;t too bad).<\/p>\n<p><b>Major events hosted here: <\/b>The venue has already hosted some high-profile soccer matches, including during the 2016 Copa America Centenario and several CONCACAF Gold Cups.

There&#8217;s never a shortage of celebrities mingling in the stands, and in 2022, the Rams became the second NFL team to win a Super Bowl in its home stadium (a feat accomplished by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers the year prior).<\/p>\n<p>FIFA went with Hollywood glitz over history by selecting SoFi &#8212; a venue not proposed on the committee&#8217;s initial list &#8212; over the venerable Rose Bowl in nearby Pasadena, which hosted the 1994 men&#8217;s final and the 1999 women&#8217;s final. But it is hard to disagree with the decision, taking into account the amenities and easier access that SoFi provides.<\/p>\n<p>SoFi will host its first soccer matches on Aug. 3 with a MLS-Liga MX doubleheader that will pit Chivas against LA Galaxy and Club America against LAFC.<\/p>\n<p><b>Major events hosted here:<\/b> Is the Super Bowl major enough?

The sports teams aren&#8217;t bad, either: the KC Royals won the baseball World Series in 2015, while the NFL&#8217;s Chiefs have won back-to-back AFC Championships (2019, 2020) and the 2019 Super Bowl thanks to the play of quarterback Patrick Mahomes. The city&#8217;s MLS team, Sporting Kansas City, were a founding member of the league back in 1996 and boast two MLS Cups (2000, 2013) and four U.S. Open Cups.<\/p>\n<p>Arrowhead was built in the 1970s and underwent extensive renovations, with a three-year, $375m upgrade to facilities and amenities to make for a more fan-friendly day out. Additional video boards, bars, concession options and VIP lounges all aim to bring the crowds closer to the action.<\/p>\n<p><b>Major events hosted here:<\/b> This stadium is no stranger to soccer. In addition to hosting World Cup qualifiers for the USMNT over the years, it has also hosted the likes of the U.S. Open Cup final (2004) and was the home for MLS side Sporting Kansas City (1996-2008), back when they were still known as the Kansas City Wizards.<\/p>\n<p>Believe it or not, Arrowhead also holds a world record: The Guinness World Records still holds the venue as the loudest-ever stadium, with a sound level of 142.2 dB recorded during the Chiefs&#8217; 42-14 win over the New England Patriots on Sept. 29, 2014.<\/p>\n<p><b>ATLANTA<\/b><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0612\/r1024392_1296x729_16-9.jpg\" width=\"100%\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><b>Venue: Mercedes-Benz Stadium, <\/b>1 AMB Drive NW, Atlanta, GA 30313<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><b>Capacity:<\/b> 75,000 (forecasted 65,085 for the World Cup)<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><b>When did it open:<\/b> 2017<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><b>Field of play dimensions:<\/b> 105 meters x 68 meters<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><b>Pro teams that play here:<\/b> Atlanta United (MLS), Atlanta Falcons (NFL)<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><b>Round of World Cup games proposed in bid:<\/b> Semifinal<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As one of the newer venues on this list, Mercedes-Benz Stadium has a modern feel and plenty of amenities.

With a canopy over all the seating and a retractable roof over the field, the stadium holds in sound and buzzes with atmosphere. The 2018 MLS Cup, which Atlanta United won, is a testament to the raucous atmosphere this stadium can deliver.<\/p>\n<p><b>Major events hosted here:<\/b> Where to begin?

(Don&#8217;t worry, he returned not long after.)<\/p>\n<p><b>BOSTON (Foxborough, Massachusetts)<\/b><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0613\/r1024649_1296x729_16-9.jpg\" width=\"100%\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><b>Venue: Gillette Stadium, <\/b>1 Patriot Place, Foxborough, MA 02035<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><b>Capacity:<\/b> 70,000<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><b>When did it open:<\/b> 2002<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><b>Field of play dimensions:<\/b> 105 meters x 68 meters<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><b>Pro teams that play here:<\/b> New England Revolution (MLS), New England Patriots (NFL)<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><b>Round of World Cup games proposed in bid:<\/b> Semifinal<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Some 40 minutes southwest of Boston, Gillette Stadium is no stranger to the World Cup. Its predecessor, Foxboro Stadium &#8212; the site of which is now parking for Revs and Pats games &#8212; hosted six matches in the 1994 tournament, and a further five games in the USWNT&#8217;s run to the 1999 title. In its current guise, Gillette has been home to World Cup qualifiers, Gold Cups and the Copa America Centenario.<\/p>\n<p>Now in its 20th year, Gillette lacks much of the glitz and modernity of many other stadiums hosting a match in 2026, but it underwent network renovations in 2016 to improve Wi-Fi availability and its food and drink offerings on main concourses are undergoing revamps to ensure fans&#8217; appetites are as satisfied as they are at stadiums increasingly offering gourmet bites. The Revolution averaged just 18,861 in attendance last season, but the Patriots have enjoyed a sellout streak dating back to 1994 and foster one of the more atmospheric home-field advantages in the NFL.<\/p>\n<p><b>Major events hosted here:<\/b> Gillette has been a long-time soccer host over its two decades of being open, and we&#8217;re not just talking about the New England Revolution. From CONCACAF Gold Cup games to Women&#8217;s World Cup games, Gillette&#8217;s been ever-present for both the men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s national teams. It&#8217;s a major East Coast tour stop for some of the world&#8217;s biggest musical acts, it&#8217;s hosted Premier League Lacrosse and more primetime NFL games (thanks to the Patriots&#8217; remarkable success) than can be counted.<\/p>\n<h2>Venues in Mexico<\/h2>\n<p>All three of the Mexico venues up for hosting were selected by FIFA in Thursday&#8217;s announcement.<\/p>\n<p><b>MEXICO CITY<\/b><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0614\/r1025089_1296x729_16-9.jpg\" width=\"100%\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><b>Venue Name: Estadio Azteca<\/b>, Calz.

Pele won his third and final World Cup with Brazil here in 1970. Argentina legend Diego Maradona scored his &#8220;Hand of God&#8221; goal (as well as an equally incredible solo effort dubbed as the &#8220;Goal of the Century&#8221;) against England in the 1986 quarterfinals before holding off West Germany in the thrilling final. It is the only stadium that will have the distinction of hosting matches in three men&#8217;s World Cup editions, and also served as a host of the 1971 predecessor to the Women&#8217;s World Cup.<\/p>\n<p>Recent renovations, largely in part to host NFL games, have reduced the capacity &#8212; from over 114,000 to about 87,000 &#8212; and have certainly dampened its once cacophonous atmosphere (just ask any USMNT player or fan of a certain era). It is the official home of <i>El Tri <\/i>and serves two Liga MX giants in Club America and Cruz Azul. Simply put, one of soccer&#8217;s great cathedrals.<\/p>\n<p><b>Major events hosted here:<\/b> Need we say more? In addition to the above, the mighty Azteca has hosted Michael Jackson, Menudo, U2 and Shakira, as well as nine NFL games (1994-2019) with another planned for 2022 between the San Francisco 49ers and Arizona Cardinals.<\/p>\n<p><b>MONTERREY (Guadalupe, Nuevo Leon)<\/b><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0614\/r1025092_1296x729_16-9.jpg\" width=\"100%\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><b>Venue Name: Estadio BBVA<\/b>, Av Pablo Livas 2011, Col.

Opened in 2015, it has been the setting for well-funded Monterrey, which experience a new period of success since moving in. Despite having a LEED environmental design award and including all the trappings of a modern venue, it has yet to host a Mexico men&#8217;s national team match. However, it will co-host the CONCACAF W Championship in July, which will pit the region&#8217;s top women&#8217;s sides &#8212; including the U.S. women&#8217;s national team.<\/p>\n<p><b>Major events hosted here:<\/b> In addition to this summer&#8217;s planned W Championship, Justin Bieber did perform here in 2017 on the Purpose World Tour.<\/p>\n<p><b>GUADALAJARA (Zapopan, Jalisco)<\/b><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0614\/r1025094_1296x729_16-9.jpg\" width=\"100%\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><b>Venue Name: Estadio Akron<\/b>, Av Circuito JVC 2800, El Bajio, 45019 Zapopan, JAL, Mexico<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><b>Capacity:<\/b> 48,071<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><b>When did it open:<\/b> 2010<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><b>Field of play dimensions:<\/b> 105 m x 68 m<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><b>Pro teams that play here:<\/b> Chivas<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><b>Round of World Cup games proposed in bid:<\/b> Round of 16<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The house that Sir Alex Ferguson and &#8220;Chicharito&#8221; debuted.

Mexico&#8217;s men&#8217;s national team has played here just once, but it hosted the region&#8217;s most recent men&#8217;s Olympic qualifying tournament, and provides an intimate and lively setting for arguably Liga MX&#8217;s most followed club.<\/p>\n<p><b>Major events hosted here:<\/b> Despite not being a venue of choice for <em>El Tri<\/em>, it did host eight matches of the 2011 U-17 World Cup as well as serving as the opening and closing ceremony site for the 2011 Pan American Games, hosting all the soccer games in that competition to boot.<\/p>\n<h2>VENUES IN CANADA<\/h2>\n<p>Of the three host cities in contention for the Canadian contingent, only Edmonton was not selected by FIFA as a tournament site.<\/p>\n<p><b>VANCOUVER<\/b><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0612\/r1024397_1296x729_16-9.jpg\" width=\"100%\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><b>Venue Name: BC Place<\/b>, 777 Pacific Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6B 4Y8<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><b>Capacity:<\/b> 54,600<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><b>When did it open:<\/b> 1983<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><b>Field of play dimensions:<\/b> 107m x 69m<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><b>Pro teams that play here:<\/b> Vancouver Whitecaps (MLS), BC Lions (CFL)<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><b>Round of World Cup games proposed in bid:<\/b> Round of 16<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This venue has already hosted a World Cup final before: It&#8217;s where the U.S. women&#8217;s national team won the 2015 World Cup on the back of a sensational Carli Lloyd hat trick to beat Japan, 5-2. BC Place is smack dab in downtown Vancouver, walking distance from bars and restaurants that World Cup-goers will take over, and in 2015, Robson Street was a sea of red, white and blue marching toward the stadium.<\/p>\n<p>The surface of BC Place is infamously artificial turf, which players sued FIFA over in 2015. That&#8217;s why Vancouver did not originally vie for a hosting spot, but late in the process the British Columbia city replaced Montreal as a candidate city. To meet the requirements for the 2026 tournament, BC Place will install grass after winning its bid to host games. In about 20 minutes, the roof can be opened or closed as needed.<\/p>\n<p><b>Major events hosted here:<\/b> In addition to its 2015 World Cup duties, BC Place is the annual host of the Canada Sevens (part of rugby&#8217;s World Sevens Series), was the main stadium for both the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2011 Paralympics, and has hosted the NFL (San Francisco 49ers beat the Seattle Seahawks 24-21 in 1998).

Ahead of the Pan Am Games, BMO Field added a $120 million expansion that included an additional 8,400 seats, a new canopy covering almost all seats, new locker rooms and premium suites.
