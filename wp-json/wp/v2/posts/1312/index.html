The merch lineup includes two limited-edition shirts with fully produced New York Post covers, in addition to tote bags, mugs, hoodies and a cap. Each feature the NYP and OJM logos, in addition to the brand new NYC Deli Association pickle logo, that we guess is a classic Kosher dill.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/ojm-tee.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Two tee shirts on a background of sandwiches \" \/>New York Post Composite       <\/p>\n<p>For those unfamiliar, OJM is a lifestyle brand created by Noah Rinsky and Bryan Seversky, which features images of elderly Jewish men in a variety of meme-able moments \u2014 most\u00a0recently demanding affordable lox prices and access to public restrooms  \u2014 in addition to real life demonstrations and \u201cprotests\u201d to bring attention to their various causes.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe inspiration for this was an homage to New York Post and Page Six designs, and then celebrate this bygone era of deli culture,\u201d Seversky told The Post. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThese guys have sort of become the New York City police in some ways, holding these places accountable for what they see as outrageous prices. Obviously there is a level of absurdity and comedy to it, but at its base truth, it\u2019s true,\u201d Rinsky added. <\/p>\n<p>The accounts now have over 55,000\u00a0Instagram\u00a0followers and 53,000\u00a0TikTok\u00a0followers along with a\u00a0merch store\u00a0where you can also shop this collection, plus prepare for Christmas with this topical tee from last season. <\/p>\n<p>Back to this new collection: Each item will be available on both the OJM Merch site as well as the New York Post Store. Some are also outlined below in greater detail with exclusive quotes from the OJM founders, most likely given on their lunch break \u2014 pockets full of condiment packets, we\u2019d imagine. <\/p>\n<p>        <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/pickle.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"A hat on a pickle background \" \/>New York Post Composite    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe NYC Deli Association, while it doesn\u2019t exist, we believe that it does,\u201d said Rinsky. \u201cIt\u2019s the Old Jewish Man in the sky keeping a watchful eye, making sure things are done right and correctly,\u201d added Seversky. <\/p>\n<p>Help protect the deli of the city with this stylish and silly cap, with an embroidered pickle logo front and center and the OJM and NYP logos on the back. <\/p>\n<h2>2. Mustard Shirt, $35, Available April 8 to 10 only<\/h2>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/mustard.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"A white shirt on a background of mustard and ketchup \" \/>New York Post Composite    <\/p>\n<p>This shirt isn\u2019t free, but mustard packets should be, in the eyes of the OJM. The funny shirt comes in a long-sleeve style to keep you warm in the freezer section of the deli, complete with this mock headline and the new NYC Deli Association logo. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWho wants to buy their own when you can get them for free all around?\u201d said Seversky. \u201cIf it\u2019s free, take two,\u201d Rinsky chimed in. \u201cBut also, don\u2019t take more than what is correct.\u201d <\/p>\n<h2>3. Napkin Shirt, $35, Available April 8 to 10 only<\/h2>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/napkins.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"A white tee shirt on a green pickle background \" \/>New York Post    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cHow many napkins is it okay to take? Do the right thing!\u201d said Servesky. <\/p>\n<p>Honestly, we don\u2019t know how many napkins is the correct amount, all we know is that you should take enough to protect this white shirt from any pastrami stains. The tee comes in unisex sizing for all napkin lovers, with this comical headline on the front. <\/p>\n<p>                <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/rocker-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"A gray hoodie on a mustard and ketchup background\" \/>New York Post Composite    <\/p>\n<p>This one is perfect for your rockin\u2019 bubbie or zaydie (grandma or gramps) or anyone who loves the retro style of OJM illustrations. This one shows an Old Jewish Man in a rocking chair, reading Page Six and smoking his nightly cigar. <\/p>\n<p>                <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/iStock-1364557560-copy.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"A Crypto bag on a pickle background\" \/>New York Post Store    <\/p>\n<p>What even is crypto, anyway? <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing!\u201d both founders said. \u201cWe like currency, paper. It\u2019s gold without the gold and all that is wrong with the world.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Instead, use your real money to invest in this tote bag, to carry around tangible paper, groceries and more. <\/p>\n<p>                <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/bag.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"A Schlep tote bag on a mustard and ketchup background \" \/>New York Post Composite    <\/p>\n<p>For those that live in New York, schlepping is a daily part of the grind. For those that don\u2019t know, the Yiddish word refers to the act of carrying too much or having to \u201cschlep out\u201d too far, like from Brooklyn to the Bronx, for example. This tote makes the former easier, helping you carry your deli order and all your condiment packets from the deli and back safely. <\/p>\n<p><em>Check out\u00a0<\/em><em>New York Post Shopping<\/em><em>\u00a0for more content.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>New York Post may be compensated and\/or receive an affiliate commission if you buy through our links.
