It may have been her dream since she was a little girl, or she found inspiration from the red carpet, but today, there are countless versions of a ball gown that she can choose from and a variety of settings she can wear it.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there is any particular setting where a ball gown is most appropriate, although they can be more fitting in certain venues,\u201d said Carrie Goldberg, founder and creative director of CLG Creative. \u201cA ballroom, ch\u00e2teau, or villa requires a certain level of drama, as does a grand expanse like a mountaintop or rolling hills.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not only the location that a bride should be thinking about. \u201cConsider the time of year, and the type of fabric,\u201d advised Stacie Houlker, owner of Stacie the Stylist. \u201cWearing a Mikado ball gown in the summer can be uncomfortable.\u201d<br \/>Added Goldberg, \u201cIf you\u2019re choosing a ball gown for the beach, I recommend that it be something super lightweight, like layers of tulle or chiffon that blows in the wind rather than a stiff silk faille, taffeta or duchess satin.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/anne_barge_fillmore_front__1_.jpg?w=683\" alt=\"Oversized florals adorn Anne Barge\u2019s Fillmore ball gown with a pleated full skirt, dropped waist and strapless neckline. $7,030, 766 Madison Ave.\" \/>Oversized florals adorn Anne Barge\u2019s Fillmore ball gown with a pleated full skirt, dropped waist and strapless neckline. $7,030, 766 Madison Ave.Handout    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/DISNEY_Belle_Ballgown.jpg?w=683\" alt=\"Inspired by Belle from Beauty and the Beast, Disney\u2019s Fairy Tale Weddings\u2019 ball gown has an ivory floral brocade fabric, corset closure bodice and scoop neckline. $3,375, Julie Allen Bridals, 154 S.

Main St., Newtown, CT.Handout    <\/p>\n<p>But managing a voluminous skirt and heavy gown can be cumbersome. A bride may need to have a few helpers on hand to assist her when posing for photos, walking down the aisle and even going to the bathroom. (Cue the bridesmaids, wedding planner or stylist.)<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEvery dramatic wedding gown in history \u2014 from Princess Diana to the Duchess of Cambridge to Grace Kelly \u2014 almost certainly had a team of people managing their fashion on their wedding day. Big volumes and long trains require expert attention!\u201d said Goldberg.<\/p>\n<p>Whether or not you have a pair of hands to help you, Houlker\u2019s top advice for moving in a ball gown is to wear wedge sneakers. \u201cThey offer the best comfort without sacrificing height and no one will know you\u2019re not wearing high-heeled shoes.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"833\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/PETER_LANGNER_SOPHIE_BALLGOWN.jpg?w=833\" alt=\"Sophie, a two-for-one look by Peter Langner, will transform from a regal tulle ball gown to a low-waist little white dress in guipure lace by simply removing the skirt. $7,000, Wedding Atelier, 72 Madison Ave., 4th Fl.\" \/>Sophie, a two-for-one look by Peter Langner, will transform from a regal tulle ball gown to a low-waist little white dress in guipure lace by simply removing the skirt. $7,000, Wedding Atelier, 72 Madison Ave., 4th Fl.Handout    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/PETER_LANGNER_SOPHIE_MINI_1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Look 2 of Sophie by Peter Langer.\" \/>Look 2 of Sophie by Peter Langer.Handout    <\/p>\n<p>While a ballgown may be the right fit for the ceremony, it may not be comfortable to mingle, dance and dine with guests over several hours. So little wonder that\u2019s it\u2019s become quite common for a bride to change into a second, or even third wedding dress as the reception evolves from cocktails to dinner and then dancing.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cChoosing a ceremony gown that is cumbersome, voluminous, and has a long train almost always requires a costume change. Even the best-made gowns with the most well-done corsets create a situation where it is challenging to dance, eat and enjoy a long night of socializing,\u201d said Goldberg.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnd a change of venue typically warrants a change of dress. What works for an outdoor or a religious ceremony doesn\u2019t typically suit a reception in a completely different space. Plus, a change of dress indicates to your guests that the party is nowhere near over.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/Theia_mini_fringe_2.jpg?w=472\" alt=\"White-on-white beading in various floral patterns and fringe add movement to Onyx by Theia, a V-neck minidress. $998, Kleinfeld Bridal, 110 W. 20th St.\" width=\"470\" height=\"1021\" \/>White-on-white beading in various floral patterns and fringe add movement to Onyx by Theia, a V-neck minidress. $998, Kleinfeld Bridal, 110 W. 20th St.Handout    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"562\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/RAMI_AL_ALI_MINI_LOOK_2_copy-1.jpg?w=562\" alt=\"The full skirt on Rami Al Ali\u2019s White Collection\u2019s mini wedding dress (Look 2) has an off-the-shoulder sweet-heart neckline accented with oversized bows. $3,310, Flora on Madison, 766 Madison Ave., 2nd Fl.\" \/>The full skirt on Rami Al Ali\u2019s White Collection\u2019s mini wedding dress (Look 2) has an off-the-shoulder sweet-heart neckline accented with oversized bows. $3,310, Flora on Madison, 766 Madison Ave., 2nd Fl.Handout    <\/p>\n<p>Finding the right time to switch looks should be thought out and planned in advance, especially if you\u2019ll need help getting out of one dress and into another. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think the ideal time for a dress change is after dinner and before cake cutting,\u201d said Lindsay Landman of Lindsay Landman Events. \u201cI love the visual of the bride showing up to cut the cake in a new look when all eyes are on her. Then, after the cake is cut, she can roll right into a final dance set and party the night away in the second dress. The key is setting the change in the timeline before the night begins and committing to sticking to the plan. This way she can ensure that she isn\u2019t missing a key moment, such as a favorite song.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So, what should a second dress, also known as a reception dress, look like? \u201cA reception dress is anything the bride wants it to be. Short, long, pants or some kind of jumpsuit,\u201d said Mark Ingram, owner of the Mark Ingram Atelier and designer of the Mark Ingram Collection. \u201cIt should feel super celebratory, venue appropriate and as figure flattering as the wedding gown. It should have movement and look great on the dance floor.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"569\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/BHLDN_pink_dress.jpg?w=569\" alt=\"Go for bold and daring in Millia London\u2019s bright pink tiered minidress with a plunging neckline and ruffled layers of tulle. $750 at BHLDN, 195 Broadway.\" \/>Go for bold and daring in Millia London\u2019s bright pink tiered minidress with a plunging neckline and ruffled layers of tulle. $750 at BHLDN, 195 Broadway.Handout    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"694\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/NADIA_MANJARREZ_BRIDAL_ROSA.jpg?w=694\" alt=\"A two-piece look by Nadia Manjarrez Studio Bridal is comprised of the Rosa Bustier and Rosa Miniskirt made from a floral embossed jacquard.

Use each fashion change as a way to explore a different facet of your personal style. Make it true to yourself.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA second party dress should reflect a super joyous and fun vibe, but be ultra glamorous,\u201d said Ingram. \u201cIf your first gown was all lace or a stylish, simple tailored fabric, then by all means break out the beads, fringe and sparkle.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The only time a woman might decide to wear a full-on ball gown is for her wedding.
