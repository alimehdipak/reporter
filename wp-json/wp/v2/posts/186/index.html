How your POS system integrates depends on the version of QuickBooks you use \u2013 QuickBooks Online or QuickBooks Desktop.<\/p>\n<h2>What is a POS system?<\/h2>\n<p>A POS system is a combination of hardware and software that helps you sell and manage your goods and services. In its most basic form, a POS system is an interface a cashier uses at checkout to ring up purchases.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>However, most modern POS software includes sophisticated features to help with inventory management and replenishment, employee scheduling and permissions, bundling and discounting and customer management.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>While you can obtain a general-purpose POS system, you can also set up a POS system that&#8217;s tailored for your industry with unique functionality to help you manage your business and improve its efficiency.<\/p>\n<h3>POS hardware<\/h3>\n<p>A typical POS hardware setup has the following components.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Touchscreen interface: You&#8217;ll need a touchscreen interface that displays the software. This may be a dedicated unit with pre-loaded software or a tablet running the POS software.<\/li>\n<li>Tablet stand: If you&#8217;re using an iPad POS system \u2013 or another tablet-based system \u2013 you ought to have a tablet stand.\u00a0<\/li>\n<li>Credit card reader: If a payment processing capability isn&#8217;t built into the touchscreen interface, you&#8217;ll need to connect a separate credit card reader.<\/li>\n<li>Receipt printer: Your retail or restaurant business requires a receipt printer to provide receipts to customers, unless you email them.\u00a0<\/li>\n<li>Cash drawer: You must have a cash drawer to securely store cash.\u00a0\u00a0<\/li>\n<li>Barcode scanner: You&#8217;ll need a handheld barcode scanner to scan items.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>POS software<\/h3>\n<p>Retailers and restaurant businesses have very different needs when it comes to POS systems, so there are specialized POS systems for each industry.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Here are the standard features of retail POS systems:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shortcut keys: If you have shortcut keys for the most frequently purchased items, you can speed up checkout.<\/li>\n<li>Omnichannel integration: When you have omnichannel integration and management, your sales both in store and online are all accounted for in your POS sales reports and inventory reports.<\/li>\n<li>Customer tools: Customer management tools, including the ability to see purchase history, help you track customer behavior.<\/li>\n<li>Inventory management: Inventory management features \u2013 including bulk product imports \u2013 help you keep track of products so you know when you need to order more.<\/li>\n<li>Employee management: Employee management tools \u2013 such as time clocks, productivity measures, and permissions \u2013 help keep your organization running smoothly.\u00a0\u00a0<\/li>\n<li>Special features: A retail POS system should be able to handle promotions, customer loyalty programs and discounts.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These are the standard features of restaurant POS systems:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Table seating and reservations<\/li>\n<li>Menu management<\/li>\n<li>Ingredient management and replenishment<\/li>\n<li>Employee scheduling<\/li>\n<li>Different stations to parse orders<\/li>\n<li>Kitchen displays<\/li>\n<li>Pre-authorized tabs, such as bar and party tabs<\/li>\n<li>Delivery option, versus pickup and dine in<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.business.com\/images\/content\/605\/261299c658ac7568b4567\/75_-75-\" alt=\"Tip\" width=\"75\" height=\"75\" align=\"left\" \/>FYI: Restaurants benefit from mobile POS systems because they are easy to use, allow for quick checkout, and enhance customer service.<\/p>\n<h3>Choosing a POS system<\/h3>\n<p>Although most POS systems are sold through payment processors, there are also third-party POS systems.
