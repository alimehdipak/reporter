The self-appointed \u201cGlambassador\u201d dresses up every day like it\u2019s the 1940s \u2014 because, well, why not? <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been dressing in vintage for almost 30 years now,\u201d Cochrum dished to The Post. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of my guiding light \u2014 just to see how I decided to dress myself and the passion that I have for not only the fashion but also for the history behind the fashion.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The influencer frequently posts her antique-esque looks for her 40,000 followers on platforms including YouTube, Instagram and TikTok.<\/p>\n<p>Cochrum first started sharing her love for vintage fashion when she began writing her blog, \u201cChronically Overdressed,\u201d in June 2013. It then evolved into an Instagram account where she began posting photos of her outfits. Not long after her account began to gain some traction, she added a YouTube channel during the COVID-19 pandemic. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe main reason that I first started my blog was to show people that, yes, we can dress ourselves in beautiful clothing and even vintage-style clothing,\u201d she said of embracing one\u2019s \u201ccurvy\u201d features. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to hide yourself. You can be the size that you are and still be beautiful, fashionable and chic.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/curvy-influencer-08.jpg?w=768\" alt=\"Christine Cochrum\" \/>The vlogger started her blog in 2013 and now publishes vintage content across Instagram, YouTube and TikTok.Christine Cochrum    <\/p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t until she lost her job and had free time that she decided to move her content to TikTok. Her TikTok account consists of content varying from 1940s hair tutorials to a how-to on styling old-timey looks. <\/p>\n<p>In a viral clip posted to TikTok late last month \u2014 which has earned almost 160,000 views \u2014 she discovered a 1939 Spiegel catalog that included a chart noting \u201clarger\u201d plus-sizes. \u201cI find it asinine that [plus-sized women] have to prove their existence throughout history,\u201d she said in her TikTok.<\/p>\n<p>She stated that the chart went up to a size 53 and a 49-inch waist \u2014 compared to today\u2019s sizing, that number would instead be size 26 or a 4X. She noted that vintage sizes apparently were more size-inclusive than what the fashion industry offers nowadays. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m always looking for catalogs [and] it just it caught my eye and realized what size it actually got up to,\u201d the Instagrammer said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve heard this throughout my entire career and my whole life \u2014 that people were larger in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/curvy-influencer-06.jpg?w=683\" alt=\"Christine Cochrum\" width=\"619\" height=\"927\" \/>One of Cochrum\u2019s favorite hobbies is collecting shopping catalogs from periods throughout history.Christine Cochrum    <\/p>\n<p>The blogger pointed out that a lightbulb went off in her head after reading the shopping magazine, noting that it was \u201cproof\u201d that larger people existed throughout history. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI have some proof here. Aside from, obviously, there\u2019s photographs of people that are larger, but just showing that, yes, we clothed ourselves \u2014 we weren\u2019t running around naked,\u201d Cochrum joked.<\/p>\n<p>Through her videos, she travels back in time \u2014 figuratively \u2014 to the decade of swing music, actor Humphrey Bogart and the invention of Tupperware. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/curvy-influencer-04.jpg?w=683\" alt=\"Christine Cochrum\" \/>\u201cI\u2019m constantly interested in the historical whys and hows of things. Learning about different hairstyles of the 1930s and 1940s, I just like learning about why would they use a certain technique or a certain product,\u201d she said.Christine Cochrum    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/curvy-influencer-07.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Christine Cochrum\" \/>The fashion influencer mainly dresses up in looks from the 1930s and 1940s.Christine Cochrum    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI know that my experience is unique because I do know that there is a lot of negativity out there. I have a lot of confidence in myself, and I think that is when it kind of stops,\u201d Cochrum said. \u201cI want to inspire other people to be able to do the same or be able to feel comfortable enough.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u2018You don\u2019t have to hide yourself. You can be the size that you are and still be beautiful, fashionable and chic.\u2019<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>She added that she gets \u201creally good feedback\u201d from fans, with many writing, \u201cThank you for showing that you can dress this way at your size.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Of course, there are some people who, when they encounter her \u201cout and about in real life, they\u2019re confused and don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m dressing the way that I am.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ll ask if I\u2019m in a play or if I am going to a wedding or something. I think a lot of it just has to do with the way society is right now. People just don\u2019t dress up anymore,\u201d the model elaborated. \u201cAnd so to see someone dressing up to go to the grocery store, it confuses them. [They] don\u2019t exactly know what to say.\u00a0For the most part, they\u2019re all very kind about it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While Cochrum tends to stick with \u201ctrue vintage\u201d eras such as the 1930s and 1940s, she dabbles with the \u201950s period from time to time.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/curvy-influencer-05.jpg?w=683\" alt=\"Christine Cochrum\" width=\"618\" height=\"926\" \/>Cochrum is often asked why she styles herself in classic fabrics and patterns for doing everyday tasks. To which she replies: \u201cBecause it\u2019s [insert day of the week]!\u201dChristine Cochrum    <\/p>\n<p>The fashionista noted that clothing from the first half of the 20th century is getting harder to find \u2014 \u201cThere\u2019s just less of it in general,\u201d she lamented. But one epoch that she would love to try is the Edwardian era, a period of British history that spans the reign of King Edward VII from 1901 to 1910.<\/p>\n<p>However, Cochrum doesn\u2019t think wearing Edwardian couture daily is a viable option, except for event-type extravaganzas. \u201cI already have an entire dressing room full of my \u201930s and \u201940s stuff,\u201d she said. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThose are very interchangeable. You can mix and match \u201930s, \u201940s and \u201950s stuff pretty easily,\u201d she said. \u201cEdwardian is kind of a beast all its own.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Fashion looks good in every size \u2014 and in every era.
