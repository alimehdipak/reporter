And this year\u2019s rainbow-flag-waving jam that had everybody releasing their wiggle was, of course, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cBreak My Soul.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The vibration-lifting first single from Bey\u2019s upcoming seventh studio album, \u201cRenaissance\u201d (out July 29), is a foundation-shaking move that is giving house music \u2014 long the sound of the underground \u2014 a home in the mainstream.

After spending most of the last two-plus years stuck dancing around our own houses \u2014 or in NYC, one-bedroom apartments \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s time to make like Technotronic and pump up the jam once again.<\/p>\n<p>And while some haters have been dragging Beyonc\u00e9 and Drake for showing their love for house \u2014 as if they were infiltrating some secret club that even A-listers like them can\u2019t get into \u2014 it\u2019s the ultimate co-sign for a genre that, much like disco before it, has been kicked to the basement over the years.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/Drake-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Drake\" \/>Drake teams up with South African DJ\/producer Black Coffee on his new house album \u201cHonestly, Nevermind.\u201dGetty Images    <\/p>\n<p>Bey and Drizzy \u2014 who you can be sure are fans and students of music as much as they are bankable hitmakers \u2014 are both tapping into the black roots of house. They\u2019re representing for a culture that, also because of its history in the gay community, has been largely marginalized.<\/p>\n<p>But as much as Beyonc\u00e9 and Drake are pumping new life into house music, they aren\u2019t the first to take the genre for a crossover spin. In the early \u201990s, CeCe Peniston, Crystal Waters and Robin. S. all scored top 10 singles with \u201cFinally,\u201d \u201cGypsy Woman\u201d and \u201cShow Me Love,\u201d respectively. In fact, it\u2019s Robin S.\u2019s 1993 hit that Beyonc\u00e9 samples on \u201cBreak My Soul.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/Robin_S_Palladium_93.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Robin S.\" \/>Robin S.\u2019 1993 hit \u201cShow Me Love\u201d is sampled on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cBreak My Soul.\u201dWireImage    <\/p>\n<p>Just in case you thought Drake invented the whole concept of rappers busting a move to house music, there was the hip-house movement in the early \u201990s \u2014 made memorable by everybody from C&amp;C Music Factory with \u201cGonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)\u201d to Snap! with \u201cThe Power\u201d to even Queen Latifah with \u201cCome Into My House.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And let\u2019s not forget Madonna, who struck a house pose and brought the ballroom scene to the masses with \u201cVogue,\u201d her 1990 No. 1 smash. Madge and other superstar divas such as Janet Jackson, Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey relied on their house remixes by the likes of Shep Pettibone, Frankie Knuckles and David Morales to connect them to a hipper \u2014 and highly influential \u2014 audience in the clubs.<\/p>\n<p>        <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/ultra_nate_97.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Ultra Nat\u00e9\" \/>House music legend Ultra Nat\u00e9 is celebrating the 25th anniversary of her 1997 classic \u201cFree.\u201dGamma-Rapho via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>Carey was even known to go back in the studio to re-cut her vocals for her house remixes. That\u2019s how much the music \u2014 and its pulsating power \u2014 meant to her.<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully, house-music legends such as Ten City, Inner City and Ultra Nat\u00e9 \u2014 who is celebrating the 25th anniversary of her classic \u201cFree\u201d this year \u2014 will feel some more love and be discovered by some new fans because of Beyonc\u00e9 and Drake.
