At the same time, the US economy shrank by 1.4% in the most recent quarter, contracting for the first time since the pandemic-induced recession two years ago.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/anna-met-1.jpg?w=1024\" \/>The Met Gala, led by Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour (right), has been slammed for this year\u2019s \u201cGilded Age\u201d theme, which is set to celebrate extreme wealth as average Americans struggle amid the soaring cost of living.
