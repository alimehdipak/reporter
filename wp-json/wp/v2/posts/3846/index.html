Many end up dead, including Jasper (Jackson Rathbone), Jane (Dakota Fanning),Caius (Jamie Campbell-Bower), Marcus (Christopher Heyerdahl) and Aro \u2014 who is killed by Edward (Robert Pattinson) and Bella themselves.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s the ultimate lean-forward moment for Twilight fans: They just killed Carlisle! And even more good guys perish in the literally head-twisting melee that follows, including teen wolf Seth (who falls to the blunt psychic force administered by Fanning\u2019s Jane) and Jackson Rathbone\u2019s Jasper.<\/p>\n<p>Months later, when she has a vision of the Volturi coming to end her family after Irina, a member of the Denali coven, mistakes Renesmee to be an immortal child, she leaves the Cullens with Jasper, making them think they have abandoned them when the truth is they are on a secret mission to save them all.<\/p>\n<p>Renesmee got married to Jacob and made Lucina her maid of honor. In Have A Purpose, Renesmee reveals that she is pregnant.<\/p>\n<p>Bella and Edward get married and go to Isle Esme for their honeymoon. Bella gets pregnant with Renesmee.<\/p>\n<p>When he became too old to continue them, he put his son in charge of the hunts. Although originally Carlisle was a disappointment, he eventually discovered a coven of true vampires living in the sewers. During a chase with them, Carlisle was bitten and changed into a vampire.<\/p>\n<p>In Alice\u2019s vision of the battle, Seth is shown leaping after and destroying a Volturi guard. He is then confronted by Jane, who tortures him with her power, allowing Felix time to crush his neck, killing him. Leah is infuriated by this. In the end, the battle doesn\u2019t happen as Aro changes their action, and Seth lives.<\/p>\n<p>Emmett Cullen<\/p>\n<p>Rosalie found him being mauled to death by a bear in 1935, and carried him over 100 miles back to Carlisle and asked him to turn him into a vampire.<\/p>\n<p>Alice was transformed by an old vampire who worked at the asylum to protect her from James, a tracker vampire who was hunting her. After some research, Alice found her grave and discovered that the date on her tombstone matches the date of her admission to the asylum.<\/p>\n<p>Jasper and Alice only married once. It appears, despite Alice\u2019s bubbly personality and Jasper\u2019s devotion to her, they don\u2019t want or need a celebration centered around them every few years. It\u2019s likely Rosalie and Emmett did enough celebrating for the entire family.<\/p>\n<p>The strange dreams, sleeping a lot, eating a lot, a late period, and a \u201csmall but defined bump\u201d can only mean one thing. She realizes she is pregnant and tells Edward. The phone rings moments later. It\u2019s Alice, but she only asks if Edward is okay and won\u2019t tell Bella what she saw.<\/p>\n<p>Jasper Hale<\/p>\n<p>The second-fastest and second-strongest of his family, Jasper is the Cullen\u2019s best overall fighter despite having a power that\u2019s relatively worthless in battle (he can influence emotions).<\/p>\n<p>While some fans believe that Leah fell in love with or imprinted on Jacob during Breaking Dawn, Stephenie Meyer has stated this isn\u2019t true. This would simply have made their interactions too complicated, since she started out disliking Jacob, then they gain a \u201cfriendly\u201d understanding.<\/p>\n<p>So goes Twilight, Stephenie Meyer\u2019s story about 17-year-old Bella Swan falling into reciprocated love with her Biology class partner, the brooding vampire Edward Cullen. Described as devastatingly beautiful, Edward has a sense of chivalry and virtue so strong he has remained a virgin his whole 108 year life.<\/p>\n<p>Bella gets pregnant after one night of passionate sex with her husband Edward the vampire, sex that leads to the destruction of their idyllic honeymoon suite.<\/p>\n<p>Here Bella tells him she\u2019s been home for two weeks, very pregnant at this point, but there is still a few weeks to go and the rest of the movie before she gives birth. Because she said she\u2019s been home 2 weeks, that would make it around September 10th when Jacob gets there.<\/p>\n<p>Amun is also considered the oldest vampire in the Twilight universe, as he was turned before the Romanian coven \u2013 the oldest coven there is \u2013 rose to power.<\/p>\n<p>Fans know, in the end, Jacob and Renesmee do live happily ever after together, along with Edward and Bella. Shoutout to Alice\u2019s future-telling skills! She gave viewers a glimpse of the future at the end of Breaking Dawn: Part 2.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sadly, the vampire-doctor loses his head to the Italian ruler, sparking the battle between the two sides.
