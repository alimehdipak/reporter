I sealed the wrap with a slice of Gorilla Tape and reworked that pattern all the way up to my hip. I repeated the task on my right leg, then strapped down my torso, chest and arms.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/031022Asia12TB.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Asia Grace\" \/>After purchasing three rolls of caution tape for a mere $25.97 at Home Depot, Grace wound the tape around herself. Kardashian had five assistants help in the taping.Tamara Beckwith    <\/p>\n<p>Two hours later, I finally was ready to hit the streets at last \u2014 sort of.<\/p>\n<p>While my look didn\u2019t have the designer pedigree that Kim\u2019s did, it presented similar mobility issues. Kardashian was snapped waddling around and struggling to sit due to the constricting limitations of being locked in a cocoon of plastic. Similarly, I found it almost impossible to walk in my getup. Oh, and caution tape isn\u2019t exactly a breathable fabric.<\/p>\n<p>It felt like wearing a sauna, though my body heat and sweat did help the tape stay in place. I could barely move; my gait was a wobble. Each short, clumsy step was accompanied by a crinkling racket of plastic rubbing against more plastic. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/031022Asia14TB.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Asia Grace\" \/>\u201cI could barely move; my gait was a wobble,\u201d Grace writes.Tamara Beckwith    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/031022Asia25TB.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Asia Grace\" \/>The catsuit felt like a sauna.Tamara Beckwith    <\/p>\n<p>I hopped on the A train, which was mostly empty, but I was too constricted to take a seat. I felt miserable, save for the parade of flattery my handmade togs elicited. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cCan you make me [a caution tape outfit] so we can match on our date?\u201d asked a cheeky drifter near Madison Square Garden. \u201cCan I be your Kanye, Ms. Kim?\u201d joked another.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>But I couldn\u2019t take it any longer. I got off the train, found the nearest bathroom and eagerly cut myself free with a large pair of scissors. I changed into a pair of beloved sweats and UGGs and relished in being able to move freely again.
