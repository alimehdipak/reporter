After the recent signing of Boubacar Kamara from Marseille, the Villans are looking to raise funds to strengthen other areas of the pitch, and with just one year left on his contract, the 24-year-old Brazilian is a strong candidate to help in that endeavour.<\/p>\n<p><b>20.55 BST:<\/b> Sevilla have declined to permanently sign <b>Anthony Martial<\/b> from Manchester United after his disappointing loan spell in Andalusia, reports the Mail. The 26-year-old France forward will now return to Old Trafford, after managing just one goal in 12 appearances in an injury-plagued LaLiga campaign.<\/p>\n<p><b>20.22 BST: Houssem Aouar<\/b> has been given the green light to leave Lyon this summer, according to RMC Sport. With interest mounting from several European clubs and the 23-year-old entering the final year of his contract, the Ligue 1 side are willing to move on from the midfielder, subject to a suitable offer. Foot Mercato has previously reported interest from Real Betis, however, after an impressive Champions League campaign, the France international is waiting for interest from bigger clubs.<\/p>\n<p><b>19.49 BST:<\/b> Newcastle United have secured a new three-year deal with midfielder <b>Sean Longstaff<\/b>. Fabrizio Romano reports that Eddie Howe was determined to keep the 24-year-old at St. James&#8217; Park after being recently linked to Manchester United, West Brom and Watford.<\/p>\n<p><b>19.16 BST:<\/b> Arsenal have made their final offer to keep <b>Eddie Nketiah<\/b> at the club, the Mail reports, with the 22-year-old&#8217;s contract expiring in just six weeks. The Gunners are confident that the striker will stay at the Emirates next season, despite West Ham United and Crystal Palace angling for a free transfer.<\/p>\n<p><b>18.43 BST:<\/b> Vincent Kompany has left his post as Anderlecht manager as talks progress over the vacancy at Burnley, according to Fabrizio Romano. The Clarets have been without a permanent manager since Sean Dyche was sacked in April and, after being relegated under caretaker manager Mike Jackson, the former Manchester City captain has been tipped as the favorite to fulfill the new managerial position at Turf Moor.<\/p>\n<p><b>18.10 BST: Ryan Gravenberch<\/b> has finalised a deal with Bayern Munich, reports De Telegraaf. The Bundesliga champions will pay Ajax a transfer fee of \u20ac19m plus \u20ac5.5m in add-ons in addition to a 7.5% sell-on clause for the 20-year-old Netherlands midfielder, who has just 12 months left on his contract in Amsterdam and was also pursued by Real Madrid and Manchester United.<\/p>\n<p><b>17.37 BST:<\/b> PSV Eindhoven are hopeful to retain <b>Cody Gakpo<\/b> for another season with a new deal that offers the forward a bonus on a transfer away next summer, according to Voetbal Primeur. The new contract reportedly would offer the 23-year-old a fair sum of a future transfer fee, if he were to leave the club for \u20ac40m, as the Eredisivie side look to deter a move to the Premier League amid interest from Arsenal, Manchester City and Liverpool.<\/p>\n<p>17.04 BST: Mohamed Salah may have confirmed he&#8217;ll be at Liverpool next season (see 15.04 BST), but is he just delaying the inevitable?<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/soccer\/blog-transfer-talk\/story\/4674556\/\" \/>play<\/p>\n<p>1:28<\/p>\n<p>Stewart Robson thinks Mohamed Salah to Real Madrid could still be on despite the forward saying he plans to stay at Liverpool next season.<\/p>\n<p>16.19 BST: Luka Modric says he is in talks with Real Madrid over a contract extension and he feels strong enough to continue playing for a few years.<\/p>\n<p>Modric, 36, becomes a free agent this summer and is expected to be offered a new deal. The Croatian midfielder joked that he won&#8217;t pull an &#8216;Mbappe&#8217; and keep Madrid waiting.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The club and I are talking, but we have a good rapport,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Do the Mbappe thing? No. I won&#8217;t, for sure. But I hope the club doesn&#8217;t do it to me. We have a lot of trust between us, we get along very well and what has to happen will happen. But now it&#8217;s the [Champions League] final and that&#8217;s the most important thing. I don&#8217;t want to think about anything else.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Modric, who has been at Madrid since 2012, has come up with 12 assists in 42 games for Los Blancos this season.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I have said many times that I want to finish my career at Real Madrid,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I feel good, but I don&#8217;t think much about the future, I&#8217;m focused on the present. I want to enjoy what I do and see what level I&#8217;m at little by little. If I can continue at this level&#8230; Because at Real Madrid you have to be at a very high level.

He is effectively enslaved to money.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The only way he could come back to Barca is for free. It would be irrational to pay a transfer fee for a player you have already had.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Leo left how he left.

Xavi Hernandez wants the Frenchman to stay, but the directors insist the winger is not essential and that he must compromise in negotiations. The report states Dembele&#8217;s stalling could slow down a move for Leeds United&#8217;s Raphinha. PSG and Bayern Munich have previously been linked to Dembele.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; With Erling Haaland on the cusp of completing his move to Manchester City, the Premier League champions are also interested in Leeds United midfielder Kalvin Phillips, reports BBC Sport. Pep Guardiola is especially keen to strengthen his midfield due to the confirmed departure of Fernandinho. It is believed that Leeds staying up will potentially make the deal more difficult to complete.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; According to the Mirror, Tottenham Hotspur manager Antonio Conte wants to bring in Eintracht Frankfurt&#8217;s Filip Kostic as a left-wing-back, with this coming after the club announced a capital increase of \u00a3150 million. In addition to filling that role, they also hope to bring in two centre-backs, a right-wing-back, a midfielder and a striker.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Mason Mount will discuss a new deal with Chelsea in the coming months, as reported by Fabrizio Romano, who adds that the midfielder has already been waiting for months. His current contract ends in 2024. Chelsea&#8217;s board will also be discussing the futures of N&#8217;Golo Kante and Jorginho, among others.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Diego Simeone has made Udinese&#8217;s Nahuel Molina the priority as Atletico Madrid aim to strengthen at right-back, according to Sky Sports Italia. This is unlikely to be a simple deal to complete due to Udinese asking for \u20ac30m, as Atleti would need to offload some players before making their move.
