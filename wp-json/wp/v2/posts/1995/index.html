to buy the social media platform, according to CNBC.<\/p>\n<p>The letter, which was signed by GOP representatives on the House Judiciary Committee led by Jim Jordan of Ohio, was addressed to Twitter Board Chairman Bret Taylor and other directors.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs Congress continues to examine Big Tech and how to best protect Americans\u2019 free speech rights, this letter serves as a formal request that you preserve all records and materials relating to Musk\u2019s offer to purchase Twitter, including Twitter\u2019s consideration and response to this offer, and Twitter\u2019s evaluation of its shareholder interests with respect to Musk\u2019s offer,\u201d the letter read.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\"

views and banish voices who don\u2019t adhere to liberal politics.<\/p>\n<p>Musk told Twitter\u2019s board the social network \u201chas potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe\u201d \u2014 an approach that has unleashed speculation he would reinstate\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter account, which was shut down following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter also angered Republicans when it blocked access to a New York Post story about Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop computer just weeks before the 2020 presidential election.<\/p>\n<p>

financing\u00a0toward his Twitter acquisition bid. <\/p>\n<p>That money could fuel a hostile takeover of the company through a tender offer, or bid to buy stock directly from shareholders, if Twitter\u2019s board continues to oppose his effort.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter\u2019s board previously enacted a \u201cpoison pill\u201d provision aimed at preventing Musk from acquiring more than 15% of the company.<\/p>\n<p>As The Post reported, Musk is also in talks with Chicago-based buyout firm Thoma Bravo about\u00a0partnering on a potential takeover bid\u00a0\u2013 a deal that sources said could be a precursor to a formal binding offer.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Congressional Republicans are laying the groundwork for an investigation of Twitter should they retake the
