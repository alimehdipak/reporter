Her win Thursday at Wimbledon earned her a spot against Elena Rybakina.<\/p>\n<p>The No. 3-seeded Jabeur, a 27-year-old from Tunisia, got past her good friend Tatjana Maria 6-2, 3-6, 6-1 in an up-and-down semifinal at a sun-splashed Centre Court on Thursday.<\/p>\n<p>Jabeur is on quite a run right now: She has won 11 consecutive matches and 22 of her past 24. Since pro players were first admitted to major tennis tournaments in 1968, never had an African been to a final. She also is the first Arab woman to get that far.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a proud Tunisian woman standing here today,&#8221; Jabeur said. &#8220;I know in Tunisia, they&#8217;re going crazy right now. I just try to inspire, really, as much as I can. I want to see more and more &#8212; not just Tunisian &#8212; Arab, African players on tour. I just love the game and I want to share this experience with them.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>She now faces Rybakina, who defeated 2019 champion Simona Halep 6-3, 6-3 on Centre Court, for the championship Saturday.<\/p>\n<p>Both the 17th-seeded Rybakina and third-seeded Jabeur are first-time Grand Slam finalists.<\/p>\n<p>Rybakina is the first Kazakhstan player to reach a major final. Jabeur is the first Arab woman to reach a major final.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I already did a lot,&#8221; Rybakina said, &#8220;and it&#8217;s just time to enjoy.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Jabeur has been rising in the tennis world in recent seasons. In 2020, at the Australian Open, she became the first Arab woman to reach the quarterfinals at a major. Last year produced all sorts of milestones: first Arab player to break into the top 10 of the men&#8217;s or women&#8217;s rankings, first Arab to win a WTA title and a quarterfinal appearance at Wimbledon.<\/p>\n<p>Now she&#8217;s done that two steps better.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t know what to say,&#8221; Jabeur said through a wide smile. &#8220;It&#8217;s a dream coming true from years and years of work and sacrifice. I&#8217;m really happy it&#8217;s paying off. One more match now.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>When she closed out the biggest victory of her career, she and Maria &#8212; a 34-year-old mother of two from Germany who is ranked 103th &#8212; met at the net for an extended hug. Jabeur whispered something in her pal&#8217;s ear. Then, after depositing her racket on the sideline, Jabeur returned to the middle of the court for the usual victor&#8217;s wave to the crowd &#8212; except, instead of going alone, she playfully tugged Maria along with her, an uncommon gesture.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I definitely wanted to share the moment with her at the end, because she&#8217;s such an inspiration for so many players, including me,&#8221; Jabeur said. &#8220;Coming back after having two babies &#8212; I still can&#8217;t believe how she did it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Before their semifinal, Jabeur and Maria stood beside each other, waiting to take the walk through the halls of the stadium that lead to the court. Close as they are, the pair avoided exchanged any glances or chatter.<\/p>\n<p>Close friends, yes. On this day, opponents, too, with quite the setting, stage and stakes.<\/p>\n<p>Neither had been to a Grand Slam semifinal previously. Maria never had been past the third round in any of her 34 prior appearances at major tournaments &#8212; and she only got that far once, at Wimbledon in 2015.<\/p>\n<p>The two hang out together frequently. They are, to use Jabeur&#8217;s term, &#8220;barbecue buddies.&#8221; Jabeur knows Maria&#8217;s two daughters so well that the German referred to her as &#8220;Aunt Ons.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Maybe that&#8217;s why neither player displayed much in the way of emotion during the match, even after terrific points. Sure, Jabeur put her hands on her hips and Maria smiled sheepishly after one lively exchange with both at the net. And Jabeur held her left fist overhead after one particularly difficult yet effective running, twisting forehand across her body for a passing winner. Maria raised her right arm after going up 5-2 in the second set.<\/p>\n<p>They offer unusual brands of speed-mixing, variety-filled tennis. On the second point of the match, Jabeur won a point by using a drop shot on a return of serve. Maria loves to hit slice forehands; Jabeur, quite capable of powerful groundstrokes, joined in on that occasionally.<\/p>\n<p>After such a strong first set, Jabeur was far less effective in the second. Perhaps it hit her just how close she was to getting to the final.<\/p>\n<p>Suddenly, mistakes began accruing rapidly. Her serving was less self-assured. Maria took full advantage. And then, just as suddenly, Jabeur switched back to her best self, pulling out to a 5-0 edge in the third in 20 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>After 17 unforced errors in the second set, Jabeur made a remarkably low total of three the rest of the way. Maria simply could not keep up.<\/p>\n<p>The 23-year-old Rybakina is the youngest Wimbledon finalist since 2015 when 21-year-old Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza lost to Serena Williams.<\/p>\n<p>Halep, the 2018 French Open champion, had reached the semifinals without dropping a set but was broken early in both sets.<\/p>\n<p>The 30-year-old Romanian wasn&#8217;t able to defend her Wimbledon title last year &#8212; after the 2020 edition was canceled &#8212; because of a calf injury.<\/p>\n<p><i>Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.<\/i><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>LONDON &#8212; Ons Jabeur&#8217;s historic run of success continues, as she becomes the first woman from Africa to make a singles final of a Grand Slam in the professional era.
