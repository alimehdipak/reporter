Now, the 69-year-old Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Famer will have Central Park grooving as music curator for DiscOasis, a roller-skating party that begins at Wollman Rink on Thursday and goes through Oct. 1.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI sure hope history remembers disco the way that I remember it because I\u2019m not just being romantic about it,\u201d Rodgers told The Post. \u201cI was in the thick of the zeitgeist,\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He\u2019s in the zeitgeist once again, as the musical genre that was once wrongly declared dead is hotter than ever. Here, Rodgers takes us behind the velvet rope of New York\u2019s disco glory days \u2014 and the songs that will be played for New Yorkers getting their groove on at the rink this summer.  <\/p>\n<h2>Donna Summer, \u201cLove to Love You Baby\u201d (1975)<\/h2>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"701\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/Summer_1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Donna Summer performing in 1983.\" \/>Donna Summer performing in 1983.Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>Before making his own production magic happen, Rodgers took inspiration from the Queen of Disco herself. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo I go out with my girlfriend at the time and we walked into this pop-up disco, which was on Broadway and Eighth Street,\u201d said Rodgers. \u201cAnd they were playing Donna Summer\u2019s \u2018Love to Love You Baby,\u2019 and I had never heard it before.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Rodgers was totally titillated by Summer\u2019s orgasmic moans. \u201cAnd that bad boy went on forever. It was like the longest thing ever,\u201d he said. \u201cSo my girlfriend and I, we started imitating the dance that everybody was doing, which was called the hustle.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He would go on to become \u201cvery, very good friends\u201d with Summer, although she would stop performing \u201cLove to Love You Baby\u201d because of its hypersexuality. \u201cDonna sort of rejected that,\u201d he said. \u201cFor years and years and years, she would never play \u2018Love to Love You Baby.&#8217;\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/Nile_Rodgers_Chic2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Chic\" \/>Nile Rodgers\u2019 band Chic scored two No. 1 disco hits with \u201cLe Freak\u201d and \u201cGood Times.\u201dSygma via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<h2>Chic, \u201cLe Freak\u201d (1978)<\/h2>\n<p>In 1977, Chic was invited to see Grace Jones at Studio 54 on New Year\u2019s Eve. \u201cAt that time, she thought that we could possibly be her next producers. So she says, \u2018Go to the back door and tell them you\u2019re personal friends of Miss Grace Jones.\u2019 But the guy slams the door in our face and says, \u2018Aw, f\u2013k off!\u2019 So, fortunately, I lived one block away from the back door of Studio 54. We stopped off at a liquor store and bought two bottles of Dom P\u00e9rignon, which we used to call \u2018Rock &amp; Roll Mouthwash.\u2019 I picked up my guitar and started singing, \u2018Aw, f\u2014k off!\u2019 So we rewrote it and eventually ended up with \u2018Freak out!\u2019 because I used to be a hippie and drop a lot of acid and all that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The result ended up being Chic\u2019s first No. 1 hit. \u201cWe never got into Studio 54 that night, but by not getting what we wanted, we got more than we could have ever believed,\u201d said Rodgers.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"692\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/Nile_Rodgers_Chic5.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Chic\" \/>Chic performing in London in 1979.Redferns        <\/p>\n<p>At the Kool Jazz Festival in 1979, Chic gave a performance of this hit that was so rousing that Marvin Gaye mistook it for an earthquake. Gaye, who was headlining the fest, was in his dressing room with Rick James. He jumped under a desk and screamed at James to do the same. James, however, knew that whatever tremors Gaye was feeling weren\u2019t due to shifting tectonic plates. \u201cRick goes, \u2018Man, that ain\u2019t no earthquake. That\u2019s just Chic,&#8217;\u201d Rodgers recalled. \u201cThe stadium was rocking all in sync, so you\u2019re getting all that downward force at the exact same time. When Rick told us the story later on that night, we were crying.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"670\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/Nile_Rodgers_Chic4.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Bernard Edwards and Nile Rodgers\" \/>Nile Rodgers (right) and his Chic producing partner Bernard Edwards in 1981.Getty Images    <\/p>\n<h2>Chic, \u201cGood Times\u201d (1979)<\/h2>\n<p>At that same festival, Rodgers thought the fun was over when the cops showed up backstage just after they finished their set. He thought they were there to bust them for drugs.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re thinking it\u2019s a raid,\u201d he said. \u201cWe took the stuff and we flushed it down the toilet.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But the police weren\u2019t looking for trouble. \u201cThey say, \u2018Hey, you guys have to come back out, because the crowd wants you to come out,\u2019\u201d Rodgers recalled.<\/p>\n<p>Turns out the crowd was demanding that Chic play this single with a bumping bass line that they had just released a few days earlier and would go on to become a No. 1 hit. \u201cWe\u2019re amazed that the people [already knew] something about \u2018Good Times,\u2019\u201d said Rodgers. \u201c[We put] a record out on Tuesday, and then Saturday everybody wants to hear it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"693\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/Sister_sledge_2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Sister Sledge\" \/>\u201cWe Are Family\u201d singers Sister Sledge performing in 1975.Getty Images    <\/p>\n<h2>Sister Sledge, \u201cWe Are Family\u201d (1979)<\/h2>\n<p>After turning down an offer to work with the Rolling Stones, Rodgers and his Chic producing partner Bernard Edwards were given the chance to work with the sibling act Sister Sledge by then-Atlantic Records president Jerry L. Greenberg. <\/p>\n<p>Rodgers and Edwards recorded this uplifting anthem of togetherness with the sisters, but they never actually got in the studio with them. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe never met Sister Sledge,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cWe did the entire \u2018We Are Family\u2019 album without meeting them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/Nile-Rodgers.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Nile Rodgers\" \/>Nile Rodgers at the DiscOasis launch announcement in May.Getty Images for The DiscOasis<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As the leader of the iconic group Chic and producer for everyone from Diana Ross to David Bowie, Nile Rodgers is the stuff of disco legend.
