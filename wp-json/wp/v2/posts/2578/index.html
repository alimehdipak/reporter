Her onscreen alter-ego, Sylvia Fox, is a disgruntled MI6 officer who\u2019s now a high-level desk jockey but misses her thrill-packed espionage days, which took her around the world.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think she\u2019s been defined by her job in the first part of her life and she\u2019s given her all to her professional life,\u201d Fox said. \u201cShe\u2019s clearly had a great relationship with her agents in the field.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sylvia still sleeps with her ex-husband, Adam (Jamie Bamber), but after feeling betrayed over a risky intelligence operation, she heads to Italy (Umbria) for the wedding of her niece, Alice (Issy Knopfler), the daughter of her older sister Isabel (Tara Fitzgerald) \u2014 who lives in Italy with her doctor-husband Matteo (Matteo Carlomagno). \u201cSylvia feels so betrayed when MI6 cut [her operatives] off and she feels like she\u2019s put them in danger and let them down,\u201d Fox said. \u201cShe feels wronged by her ex-husband \u2026 and she\u2019s deciding whether to let all that go for the new life she discovers in Italy.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/signora-volpe-8.jpg?w=1024\" \/>Emilia Fox and Tara Fitzgerald as Sylvia and Isabel in a scene from \u201cSignora Volpe.\u201dMoris Puccio\/AcornTV    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s used to operating alone and clearly she\u2019s very good at her job \u2014 she\u2019s brave, intelligent, insistent and physical,\u201d Fox said. \u201cI think that her going to Italy and exposing herself to the complications of family life \u2026 she can\u2019t help but start to feel the emotions you do with family and maybe that opens up a whole new side of her.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sylvia and Isabel have a fraught sibling relationship \u2014 you\u2019ll learn more about that as the series progresses \u2014 and, before too long, Sylvia is using her cloak-and-dagger expertise to investigate Alice\u2019s sketchy fiancee, Tomasso, who\u2019s hiding a criminal past. <\/p>\n<p>At the end of Episode 1, Sylvia \u2014 energized by her second career and charmed with the Italian way of life \u2014 buys a dilapidated farmhouse near the medieval town of Panicale and settles into her new life as a transplanted crime solver.<\/p>\n<p>While she\u2019s busy solving crimes \u2014 in the second episode, Sylvia discovers a skeleton at an archaeological dig that\u2019s linked to a local man suspected of the murder \u2014 she also encounters the local Carabinieri (police force) in the form of Captain Riva (Giovanni Cirfiera), who dubs her \u201cSignora Volpe\u201d (\u201cvolpe\u201d means Fox in Italian). Their grudging tolerance for each other morphs into a mutual respect \u2014 and maybe even more. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/signora-volpe-7.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Sylvia and Captain Riva, played by Giovanni Cirfiera.

It\u2019s owned by a wonderful painter and you can see lots of her paintings on the wall in Sylvia\u2019s house. They\u2019re some of the most beautiful paintings I\u2019ve ever seen and, in fact, I ended up bringing many of them home [to the UK] having bought them.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI  got stopped at the airport by the staff there telling me how beautiful they thought [the paintings] were.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Call her the Fox in the farmhouse.
