We&#8217;ve battled. We&#8217;ve been through everything you can think of and, for the most part, we&#8217;ve found a way to come out on top.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Avalanche captured their first Stanley Cup since 2001 with the victory. They were favored to win the Cup as the playoffs began as well as to win this series.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like we lost to some powder puff,&#8221; Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper said. &#8220;That&#8217;s a baller team over there. We never had home ice. We played all these star-studded teams. They found a way. We just ran into one more brick wall, and we just couldn&#8217;t get through this one.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p>Cooper agreed with Stamkos that the Lightning&#8217;s run didn&#8217;t end with the Avalanche. In the past eight years, the Lightning have been to six conference finals and advanced to the Stanley Cup Final four times.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The playoff streak ended. But it&#8217;s not the end of our run,&#8221; Cooper said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been extremely fortunate in my coaching career to have won championships at different levels, and those are the teams you remember. Sometimes, you don&#8217;t remember as much that a team didn&#8217;t win. But I think I&#8217;ll remember this team the most. What these guys went through, with the injuries &#8230; it&#8217;s been well-documented what kind of warriors they are. You should see what&#8217;s going on [with injuries].&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Lightning were without star center Brayden Point, who missed the previous two rounds with a lower-body injury he suffered in Game 7 against the Toronto Maple Leafs on May 14. Point played the first two games against Colorado and was ineffective, and he didn&#8217;t appear in the rest of the series. Forward Anthony Cirelli and defenseman Erik Cernak played through injuries, as did a number of other players.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When the injury report comes out, you&#8217;re going to be shocked,&#8221; Tampa Bay forward Pat Maroon said. &#8220;I&#8217;m just so proud of these guys for what these guys have done the last three years. We made a hell of a run. We just fell short.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Lightning enter the offseason with a handful of free agents, including clutch winger Ondrej Palat, trade deadline pickup Nick Paul and steady defenseman Jan Rutta. But the team&#8217;s core is under contract for 2022-23.<\/p>\n<p>Whether they make a bid for three Cups in four seasons or not, Cooper said this group belongs among the greatest teams in NHL history.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;These guys are right up there with the 1980s Islanders and the Oilers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Teams that you talk about for decades.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>TAMPA, Fla. &#8212; The Tampa Bay Lightning fell short of the first Stanley Cup three-peat since 1983 &#8212; but they don&#8217;t believe their dynasty has crumbled.&#8221;Who said we&#8217;re done?&#8221; Lightning captain Steven Stamkos said after his team&#8217;s 2-1 loss to the Colorado Avalanche in Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Final on Sunday night. &#8220;This&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":4093,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[13],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4092"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4092"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4092\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4092"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4092"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4092"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
