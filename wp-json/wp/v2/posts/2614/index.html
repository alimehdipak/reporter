( This one\u2019s my personal favorite)<\/p>\n<h3>What are top 10 Most famous conspiracy theories of all time?<\/h3>\n<h3>1. The Moon landing was faked<\/h3>\n<p>The moon landing conspiracy theory suggests that the Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969 was staged by NASA and the U.S. government as a propaganda tool to win the Space Race against the Soviet Union. Proponents of this theory claim that the moon landing never happened, and that it was all a hoax staged by NASA.<\/p>\n<h3>2. 9\/11 was an inside job<\/h3>\n<p>The 9\/11 conspiracy theory is the belief that the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon were not carried out by Islamic terrorists, but rather by elements within the U.S. government as a false flag operation designed to justify the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq.<\/p>\n<h3>3. The JFK assassination was a conspiracy<\/h3>\n<p>The JFK assassination conspiracy theory holds that the U.S. government was behind the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963. Proponents of this theory claim that there was a wide-ranging conspiracy involving multiple individuals and organizations, including the CIA, FBI, and the Mafia.<\/p>\n<h3>4. The Holocaust never happened<\/h3>\n<p>The Holocaust denial conspiracy theory is the belief that the Nazi extermination of Jews during World War II did not happen, or that it has been greatly exaggerated. Proponents of this theory claim that the Holocaust is a hoax fabricated by Jews to gain sympathy and support for their political goals.<\/p>\n<h3>5. The Earth is flat<\/h3>\n<p>The flat Earth conspiracy theory suggests that the Earth is not a globe, but rather a flat disc. Proponents of this theory claim that the scientific evidence for a spherical Earth is false, and that spacecraft photos showing a curved horizon are part of a conspiracy to fool the masses.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Chemtrails are being sprayed by planes<\/h3>\n<p>The chemtrail conspiracy theory holds that the contrails left behind by jet aircraft are actually chemicals or biological agents being deliberately sprayed into the atmosphere for nefarious purposes. These purposes include population control, weather modification, and mind control.<\/p>\n<h3>7. The Vatican is hiding aliens and UFOs<\/h3>\n<p>The Vatican alien and UFO conspiracy theory suggests that the Catholic Church is aware of extraterrestrial life and has been hiding this knowledge from the public. Proponents of this theory claim that the Vatican has been in contact with aliens and has been covering up UFO sightings.<\/p>\n<h3>8. The Illuminati is real and controls the world<\/h3>\n<p>The Illuminati conspiracy theory suggests that there is a secret society of elite individuals who are manipulating world events for their own benefit. Proponents of this theory claim that the Illuminati control the financial, political, and media industries, and that they are working towards a New World Order.<\/p>\n<h3>9. The government is using mind control techniques on its citizens<\/h3>\n<p>The mind control conspiracy theory holds that the government is using various techniques to control the thoughts and behavior of its citizens. Proponents of this theory claim that the government uses mind control for propaganda purposes, or to keep people in line.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Global warming is a hoax<\/h3>\n<p>The global warming conspiracy theory suggests that the scientific consensus on climate change is false, and that the phenomenon of global warming is either exaggerated or entirely fabricated. Proponents of this theory claim that the true purpose of the global warming scare is to justify oppressive government regulations.<\/p>\n<p>There you have it, the top 10 conspiracy theories of all time.
