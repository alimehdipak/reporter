But where that series was a parody of the true-crime genre, \u201cPlayers\u201d pokes fun at sports documentaries. It follows a fictional pro \u201cLeague of Legends\u201d esports team as they pursue their first championship \u2014 after years of just missing out \u2014 with star players \u201cCreamcheese\u201d (Misha Brooks), 27, and 17-year-old rookie \u201cOrganizm\u201d (Da\u2019Jour Jones).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTony and I have always been fascinated with documentary and mockumentary filmmaking, but specifically sub genres of documentary like the sports doc,\u201d Perrault told The Post. \u201cWe were coming off of \u2018American Vandal\u2019 and true crime, and we thought, \u2018Is there a version we can do with our favorite documentary sub genre?&#8217;\u201d <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/players-paramount-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Creators Tony Yacenda (left) and Dan Perrault (right). \" \/>Creators Tony Yacenda (left) and Dan Perrault (right). Getty Images for Paramount+    <\/p>\n<p>Yacenda said that neither of them were entrenched in the world of esports, but as they learned more about it, they became interested in building a series around it.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTruthfully, there was just curiosity, like \u2018I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re selling out the Staples Center with kids watching other kids play video games.\u2019 That seems insane to us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we started doing some research. And it clicked for me as a series when we\u00a0were talking to these former pros \u2026 I\u2019m like, \u2018It\u2019s not this super-technical video game show, it\u2019s a show about the aging vet and the young hotshot rookie.\u2019 It\u2019s a classic story, but in this fresh new world, and in this mockumentary format. I don\u2019t think the story has been told quite like this.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/players-paramount-3.jpg?w=1024\" \/>Misha Brooks as Creamcheese, an esports star, in \u201cPlayers.\u201d CBS Television Studios    <\/p>\n<p>Perrault said that as the two looked into this fast-growing world, they got ideas for \u201cPlayers\u201d \u2014 especially when they saw how young many of the stars are.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no character on the show that\u2019s specifically based on one real life person. But one thing that fascinated Tony and I is how young the world is, and how quickly these kids rise to fame \u2013 and don\u2019t always stay there long,\u201d Perrault said. If you\u2019re 17-18 years old, you might be one of the best players in the world. If you\u2019re 25 or 26, you may be on the way out. It\u2019s dramatically interesting, and we touch on it in the show \u2014 how one character can be so famous in one bubble, but outside of that bubble, it\u2019s not quite the same.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEsports is \u2026 a massive bubble, outside of which some people like parents and certain friends from home don\u2019t get it. We found it interesting to see what is life like on the verge of returning back to that life.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/players-paramount-7.jpg?w=1024\" \/>Da\u2019Jour Jones as Organizm, Ely Henry as Coach Kyle Braxton, and Misha Brooks as Creamcheese in \u201cPlayers.\u201d CBS Television Studios    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/players-paramount-9.jpg?w=1024\" \/>Misha Brooks as Creamcheese in \u201cPlayers\u201d CBS STUDIOS    <\/p>\n<p>The creative duo cites \u201cCheer\u201d and \u201cF1: Drive to Survive\u201d as inspirations, since they uncovered subcultures in those docuseries that audiences might not have known much about.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe love documentaries un-ironically,\u201d said Yacenda. \u201c\u2018The Last Dance\u2019 was the highlight of our summer. I\u2019m surprised that the rules of the mockumentary haven\u2019t really changed much since [the 1984 heavy-metal rock spoof] \u2018Spinal Tap,\u2019 but documentaries have changed so much. So, we feel like there\u2019s fertile territory there.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As for \u201cAmerican Vandal,\u201d which was axed in 2018 after two seasons, Yacenda and Perreault said there might still be a future for it on a different platform.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know if and when it will happen, but we absolutely have a third story that we\u2019d love to tell, if given the right opportunity,\u201d Perrault said.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Creators Tony Yacenda and Dan Perrault, best known for \u201cAmerican Vandal,\u201d are turning to the world of e-sports in their latest show, \u201cPlayers.\u201d Premiering Thursday, June 16 (Paramount+), \u201cPlayers\u201d is a mockumentary&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":3881,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[5],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3880"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/6"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3880"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3880\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":6250,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3880\/revisions\/6250"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3880"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3880"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3880"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
