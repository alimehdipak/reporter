Some 227 of these also had the influenza virus, and they experienced significantly more severe outcomes.<\/p>\n<p>Dr Maaike Swets, PhD student at the University of Edinburgh and Leiden University, said: &#8220;In the last two years we have frequently witnessed patients with Covid-19 become severely ill, at times leading to an ICU admission and the employment of an artificial ventilator to help with breathing. That an influenza infection could give rise to a similar situation was already known, but less was understood about the outcomes of a double infection of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Professor Kenneth Baillie, Professor of Experimental Medicine at the University of Edinburgh, said: &#8220;We found that the combination of Covid-19 and flu viruses is particularly dangerous. This will be important as many countries decrease the use of social distancing and containment measures. We expect that Covid-19 will circulate with flu, increasing the chance of co-infections. That is why we should change our testing strategy for Covid-19 patients in hospital and test for flu much more widely.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Professor Calum Semple, Professor of Outbreak Medicine and Child Health at the University of Liverpool, said: &#8220;We are seeing a rise in the usual seasonal respiratory viruses as people return to normal mixing. So, we can expect flu to be circulating alongside Covid-19 this winter. We were surprised that the risk of death more than doubled when people were infected by both flu and Covid-19 viruses. It is now very important that people get fully vaccinated and boosted against both viruses, and not leave it until it is too late.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Dr Geert Groeneveld, doctor at Leiden University Medical Center&#8217;s infectious diseases department, said: &#8220;Understanding the consequences of double infections of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses is crucial as they have implications for patients, hospitals and ICU capacity during seasons that SARS-CoV-2 and influenza circulate together.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Professor Peter Openshaw, Professor of Experimental Medicine at Imperial College London, said: &#8220;Being infected with more than one virus is not very common but it&#8217;s important to be aware that co-infections do happen. The vaccines that protect against Covid-19 and flu are different, and people need both. The way that these two infections are treated is also different so it&#8217;s important to test for other viruses even when you have a diagnosis in someone who is hospitalised with a respiratory infection. This latest discovery by the ISARIC consortium again adds significantly to improving the way we manage patients.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The findings have been published in <em>The Lancet<\/em>.
