fashionable society set, showed a white couture silk gazar floor-length cape with black hand-beaded New York skyscrapers in February 2020 during his Fall\/Winter 2020 runway show at New York Fashion

flooded with fashion lovers pointing out the similarities to his original design. \u201cI came here 41 years ago with $300 to study at Parsons School of Design and I wanted to show my love and appreciation for the city that embraced me \u2014 and allowed me to live the American Dream.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In fact, Toi debuted his black-and-white skyscraper cape many years ago during his Spring
