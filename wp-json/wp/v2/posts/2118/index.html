That was something I always thought about,&#8221; Wright said of his NBA ambitions. &#8220;My experience with the Olympics kind of scratched that itch. &#8230; I kind of feel like I did it a little bit. And I loved coaching those guys.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Wright was part of San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich&#8217;s gold-medal-winning Team USA staff, a group that also included Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr and Boston Celtics coach Ime Udoka.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Right now I definitely need a break,&#8221; Wright said Tuesday. &#8220;Right now I&#8217;m looking forward to this [special assistant] position at Villanova.

I just didn&#8217;t want to be the coach at Villanova and not be 100 percent in.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Wright, 60, is taking a new role as special assistant to the university president.
