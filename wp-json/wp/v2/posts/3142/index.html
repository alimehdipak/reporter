But did you know that gum disease is one of the top reasons for tooth loss in adults? And that it can even lead to serious health problems like heart disease, stroke, and diabetes? It\u2019s true! To help you protect your smile and avoid these diseases, we\u2019ve put together a list of foods to avoid to help you avoid gum disease.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Foods to Avoid:<\/b><\/h2>\n<h3><b>White Bread<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The starch in white bread is quickly converted into sugar. The more white bread you eat, the more sugar you will have in your body. The best way to keep your mouth healthy is to eat foods that are good for your <a href=\"https:\/\/blogbuzzer.weebly.com\/blog\/what-to-eat-after-wisdom-teeth-removal\">teeth<\/a>. Choose foods that are not processed and contain lots of fiber.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b><i>Citrus Fruits<\/i><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Citrus fruits are not good for your teeth because of their acidity. Rinse your mouth afterward to lower the acidity and lessen its effect on your teeth.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Sports Drinks<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sports drinks are often advertised as healthy alternatives to soda, but they do little to improve your oral health. As we learned above, both sugar and acids cause significant damage to your teeth when they are combined. Many popular sports drinks contain high levels of both chemicals.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Soda<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soda is a big &#8216;no-no&#8217; for your teeth because of its high sugar and acid content. It can cause dry mouth, too, meaning you don&#8217;t have enough saliva to fight tooth decay.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Alcohol<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alcohol can increase the risk of getting oral cancer, as well as periodontal disease. Drinking alcohol can dry out your mouth and make it harder for saliva to wash away bacteria from your teeth. It was discussed earlier how saliva plays a role in gum health, meaning that the lack of it will increase your chances of developing gum disease.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Sticky\/Chewy Candies<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When sugar gets stuck in between your teeth, it promotes a breeding ground for bacteria.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You know the importance of brushing your teeth regularly.
