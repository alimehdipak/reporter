The <i>Blaugrana<\/i> see the striker position as a key area to strengthen and, while Bayern Munich&#8217;s Robert Lewandowski remains the priority, they are looking at alternatives in case the Poland international&#8217;s situation becomes too complicated. Barca boss Xavi Hernandez feels that Moreno meets his requirements, having netted 13 goals in 27 games last season, and despite his release clause of \u20ac100 million, the Yellow Submarine are willing to negotiate and could accept around \u20ac40m &#8212; a similar figure to what the Catalans are planning to invest to sign Lewandowski.

Negotiations were simple due to both sides being keen to stay together, and Modric will fly to the Santiago Bernabeu to sign the contract before re-joining his Croatia teammates.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; RB Leipzig are considering a move for Spartak Moscow midfielder Alex Kral, according to Sky Germany. The Czech Republic international played one solitary Premier League minute during his season on loan at West Ham United. There have been initial exchanges between the player&#8217;s management and RB Leipzig, who could be set to lose Konrad Laimer and Amadou Haidara. They are also open to offloading USMNT star Tyler Adams if a suitable offer comes in.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Corriere dello Sport have offered an insight into Roma&#8217;s possible activity in the summer transfer window, stating that Roger Ibanez, Stephan El Shaarawy and Nicolo Zaniolo could be among the various players to leave.
