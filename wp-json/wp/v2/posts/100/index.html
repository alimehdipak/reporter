Some Fridge No More employees even interviewed for jobs at Doordash. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe have had numerous meetings and calls with them, some of you had interviews,\u201d Danilov wrote in Thursday\u2019s message to employees. \u201cEverything seemed to be going well and moving forward until Tuesday morning.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/doordash-fridge-no-more-01.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Doordash\" width=\"618\" height=\"411\" \/>Some Fridge No More employees interviewed for jobs at Doordash. Anadolu Agency via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>Then on Wednesday, Doordash \u201cunexpectedly cancelled the deal and stopped financing,\u201d according to Danilov.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was not provided a detailed reason as to why,\u201d he said.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Danilov did not mention Doordash by name in the messages, referring instead to an unnamed \u201cpromising strategic partner,\u201d but The Post independently confirmed that Doordash was the company involved. <\/p>\n<p>A source close to Doordash told The Post that \u201cthe talks ended due to multiple factors that arose during due diligence including operational issues that would have been costly and have taken months to remediate. These issues were communicated to the Fridge No More team.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But a source close to Fridge No More\u2019s leadership claimed that Doordash\u2019s sudden withdrawal was due Danilov and co-founder Anton Gladkoborodov being from Russia \u2014 even though the source familiar said the founders did not support Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think they did not want the PR of acquiring a company with Russian founders right now,\u201d the source said. \u201cWhat is really sad to me is they judge the guys not by who they were or what they stood for but by their country of birthplace.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Doordash declined to comment on the record and Fridge No More did not respond to a request for comment.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/doordash-fridge-no-more-03.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Fridge No More\" \/>About 600 Fridge No More employees in New York City and Boston were laid off on Thursday.
