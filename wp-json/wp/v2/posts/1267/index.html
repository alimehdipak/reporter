wand\"><\/p>\n<p>Potter fans can bring the magic to their iPhone with a few special tricks.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to Siri and some easy hacks, you can make your device cast all sorts of spells you\u2019ll know from the\u00a0Wizarding World of Harry Potter.<\/p>\n<p>From Lumos to Silencio, here are 10 you can try out.<\/p>\n<p>Some will need setting up on the iPhone Shortcuts app, but they\u2019re pretty straightforward.<\/p>\n<h2>Lumos<\/h2>\n<p>Probably one of the most well-known Potter spells is Lumos, which is used by Harry and friends to light up their wands as they lurk through the corridors of Hogwarts at night.<\/p>\n<p>Just like a wizard or witch, you can ask your iPhone to light up too \u2013 or your iPhone\u2019s torch at least.<\/p>\n<p>Just say: \u201cHey Siri, Lumos.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Nox<\/h2>\n<p>Lumos wouldn\u2019t be complete without the ability to switch your torch off too.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s where Nox comes in.<\/p>\n<p>Just say: \u201cHey Siri, Nox.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/harry-potter-19.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"A bright light is expelled from Harry Potter's wand.\" \/>Tell Siri \u201cLumos\u201d to light your phone as a wizard would to light their wand.WARNER BROS AND J K ROWLING \/ Ro    <\/p>\n<h2>Accio<\/h2>\n<p>Accio is used by magic folk to summon objects to them.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, you can\u2019t fetch items from across your room like Harry \u2013 that would be something \u2013 but you can use it to open apps.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, it\u2019s worth noting that you can ask Siri to open apps without saying Accio, so this one is best for the hardcore Potter fans.<\/p>\n<p>Just say: \u201cHey Siri, Accio\u201d and the app\u2019s name.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/harry-potter-18.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Hermione Granger holds her wand.\" \/>Telling Siri \u201cAccio\u201d is a cool way to open specific apps on your iPhone.Courtesy of Warner Bros Pictures    <\/p>\n<h2>Spells with the Shortcuts app<\/h2>\n<p>The following spells can only be done using the Shortcuts app on iPhone.<\/p>\n<p>For each, start by tapping the + icon in the top right, followed by Add Action.<\/p>\n<h2>Lumos Maxima<\/h2>\n<p>Search for \u201cSet Torch\u201d and select it.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll notice an arrow pointing right next to the words \u201cTurn torch on.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Tap it and set the brightness right up.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, name it \u201cLumos Maxima\u201d at the top and hit the play button at the bottom.<\/p>\n<p>Now when you say, \u201cHey Siri, Lumos Maxima\u201d the light will switch on to its brightest.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/harry-potter-16.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Voldemort uses a

<\/p>\n<h2>Silencio<\/h2>\n<p>Silencio does what it says on the tin \u2013 silence.<\/p>\n<p>Search \u201cSet focus\u201d and tap Off so it changes to On.<\/p>\n<p>Name it \u201cSilencio\u201d at the top and hit the play button at the bottom.<\/p>\n<p>When you say \u201cHey Siri, Silencio,\u201d it\u2019ll automatically go into do not disturb mode.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\"

not disturb setting.Courtesy of Warner Bros Pictures    <\/p>\n<h2>Muffliato<\/h2>\n<p>Muffliato is used in the Wizarding World to create a muffle so others can\u2019t hear private conversations.<\/p>\n<p>On iPhone, you can do something similar, by setting the volume all the way down.<\/p>\n<p>Search \u201cSet Volume\u201d and take the percentage right down.<\/p>\n<p>Name it \u201cMuffliato\u201d at the top and hit the play button at the bottom.<\/p>\n<p>When you say \u201cHey Siri, Muffliato,\u201d it\u2019ll turn the volume right down.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\"

telling Siri \u201cMuffliato,\u201d you can automatically turn your phone\u2019s volume down.\u00a9Warner Bros\/courtesy Everett C    <\/p>\n<h2>Sonorus<\/h2>\n<p>Sonorus is ideal when you want to turn the volume right up.<\/p>\n<p>Do the same as Muffliato above, but this time set the volume higher and name it \u201cSonorus\u201d instead of course.<\/p>\n<p>When you say \u201cHey Siri, Sonorus,\u201d it\u2019ll crank up.<\/p>\n<h2>Quietus<\/h2>\n<p>If you want the volume set to something more moderate, use Quietus.<\/p>\n<p>Repeat the same process but go for a medium volume instead, like 50 percent.<\/p>\n<p>When you say \u201cHey Siri, Quietus,\u201d it\u2019ll get working.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\"

similar iPhone set up guidelines.\u00a9Warner Bros\/courtesy Everett C    <\/p>\n<h2>Homenum Revelio<\/h2>\n<p>Homenum Revelio reveals who is in your presence.<\/p>\n<p>If you use Find My Friends, you can make it do something similar.<\/p>\n<p>Simply search \u201cOpen URLs\u201d and add it.<\/p>\n<p>Set the URL to \u201cfindmyfriends:\/\/\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Then say: \u201cHey Siri, Homenum
