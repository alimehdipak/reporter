We were an underground band.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But while working with Giorgio Moroder \u2014 the legendary producer of \u201cTake My Breath Away\u201d \u2014 on some other material, Nunn and Berlin got their big break. \u201cHe approached a bunch of other female artists who were way bigger than me and Berlin, and a few of them did demos, but the [\u2018Top Gun\u2019] producers didn\u2019t like them,\u201d said Nunn. \u201cSo finally, I got a shot at it. And they loved it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/berlin-1980s.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Berlin\" \/>Berlin in its electro-pop heyday circa the 1980s.Michael Ochs Archives    <\/p>\n<p>Thirty-six years after Berlin\u2019s synth-pop swooner was released, Nunn can hear echoes of the tune in the retro-\u201980s power balladry of Gaga\u2019s \u201cHold My Hand,\u201d which dropped earlier this week.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I love about it is that nod to Giorgio Moroder\u2019s production, because the drums are so big and reverbed,\u201d she said, noting that Gaga was the perfect singer to pilot a \u201cTop Gun\u201d tune. \u201cShe\u2019s a great writer, she\u2019s a great artist. If they can get her to do it, yeah, it\u2019s a good choice.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After Nunn breathed a cool sensuality into Berlin\u2019s 1986 chart-topper, the tune \u2014 co-written by Moroder and Tom Whitlock \u2014\u00a0 followed Kenny Loggins\u2019 \u201cDanger Zone\u201d as the second hit single from the blockbuster \u201cTop Gun\u201d soundtrack. But after \u201cTake My Breath Away\u201d was nominated for Best Original Song at the 1987 Oscars, Nunn declined an offer to perform the truncated tune as part of a medley at the Academy Awards.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"715\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/top-gun-01.jpg?w=715\" \/>Berlin\u2019s \u201cTake My Breath Away\u201d hit home as the romantic theme song for Kelly McGillis and Tom Cruise in the original \u201cTop Gun.\u201dGetty Images    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI said, \u2018Well, no, because if I can\u2019t do the whole song, I\u2019m not doing it,\u2019 \u201d said Nunn, who was on tour with Berlin when Lou Rawls and Melba Moore performed her song instead. \u201cThat actual night I watched the Oscars on television in Taiwan. And we won.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To this day, Nunn regrets that decision. \u201cI was just young and dumb,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s just stupid.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After Berlin \u2014 which, despite its name, is actually a Los Angeles-based band \u2014 broke up at the end of the \u201980s, the group reunited in 1998, and they\u2019ve been recording and touring ever since.
