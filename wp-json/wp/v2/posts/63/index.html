Miu Miu has been sold out of the coveted item for weeks despite an eye-popping price tag: The skimpiest version of the khaki miniskirt costs $950, with a slightly longer version available for $1,150.<\/p>\n<p>Miu Miu first presented the micro-mini skirt during its spring 2022 fashion show last October.

In the last week of February, there were 900 daily searches\u00a0for the iconic set \u2014 the mini can be paired with an array of ultra-cropped tops, which just about cover the bra line. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/miu-miu-7.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=682\" alt=\"Cindy Bruna sports a khaki Miu Miu micro-mini skirt set\" \/>Miuccia Prada first debuted the micro mini skirt set during the her spring 2022 show.
