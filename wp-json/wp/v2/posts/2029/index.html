Courtesy of Knight Frank    <\/p>\n<p>In her biography, \u201cEst\u00e9e: A Success Story,\u201d Lauder called the villa her favorite home. She bought the home when it was new, but it\u2019s not clear how long she lived there.<\/p>\n<p>Harris says that the current owner moved in sometime in 2014 or 2015 and fully renovated it with high-speed Wi-Fi and modern bathrooms and plumbing. They continued to invest heavily in the home\u2019s upkeep over the years.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not hard to see why the villa was so beloved to Lauder. Harris says that it offers attractive views of the Mediterranean Sea, Bay of Cannes and the Esterel Mountains. \u201cThe daytime panoramas are fantastic, but the sunsets over the mountains are a sight to be seen,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>The more than 4,300 square feet of interiors also have an abundance of natural light, six bedrooms, sex bathrooms \u2014 all with marble floors \u2014 and three reception rooms for entertaining. His and hers bathrooms are a feature in the primary bedroom.<\/p>\n<p>Outside, there\u2019s a swimming pool, a large terrace as well as several smaller ones, a kitchen and a separate studio apartment with a kitchen.<\/p>\n<p>Harris says that while the manse is imposing and impressive, it\u2019s a home first and foremost and very comfortable.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s grand, but it\u2019s low maintenance, which is rare with properties of this nature,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no acres of grounds with mature trees or vast lawns that you constantly need to tend do. You can simply lock it up and leave for the season.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s the south of France villa where cosmetics entrepreneur Est\u00e9e Lauder spent her summers, and now, it can be your vacation spot, too.
