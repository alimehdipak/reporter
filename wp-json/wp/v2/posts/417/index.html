Take rising style superstar Iris Law, 21, who turned heads during London fashion week when she wore the gold Versace gown Beyonc\u00e9 donned for the 2003 MTV Movie Awards. Then there\u2019s Kanye West\u2019s ex-girlfriend Julia Fox, 32, and his billionaire ex-sister-in-law Kylie Jenner, 24, who both recently resurrected Madonna\u2019s signature cone-bra swag from the \u201990s.<\/p>\n<p>But whether reviving old looks is about paying respect to fashion\u2019s foremothers or shamelessly chasing clout is anybody\u2019s guess. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor a lot of up-and-coming A-listers, rewearing vintage celebrity couture is a cool opportunity to pay homage to the powerful women who rocked these memorable red-carpet moments,\u201d author, fashion editor and stylist Caroline Vazzana, 29, told The Post.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, \u201cstars on the rise know that reviving iconic couture is going to create major media buzz for them,\u201d the NYC-based social media star added. \u201cAfter a girl is seen wearing a Beyonc\u00e9 dress, the world is going to be looking at her for what she\u2019ll wear next and how she\u2019ll put her spin on another celebrity\u2019s legendary look.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how today\u2019s It girls are resurrecting some of the red carpet\u2019s greatest hits.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2>Getting buzz in a Beyonc\u00e9 redo<\/h2>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/02\/beyonce.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Beyonce and Iris Law\" \/>Iris Law (left) recently wore Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2003 corseted Versace dress.SGranitz\/WireImage; Dave Benett\/Getty Images for Perfect Magazine    <\/p>\n<p>Raiding Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s closet is a bold move. But catwalk newcomer Iris Law dared to dazzle London fashion week in Queen Bey\u2019s 2003 corseted Versace dress nonetheless. \u201cIris and her team really put her out there in a very vulnerable way, because Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Beyhive fan base can be very particular about how [Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s legacy] is upheld,\u201d Vazzana said, laughing. \u201cBeyonc\u00e9 is Beyonc\u00e9. So wearing anything that she wore is going to get a lot of publicity, good or bad.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Boldly rocking Aaliyah\u2019s frock<\/h2>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/02\/Aaliyah-Bretman-Rock.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Aaliyah and Bretman Rock\" \/>Last year, beauty influencer Bretman Rock (right) wore the tiger-striped Roberto Cavalli dress R&amp;B superstar Aaliyah (left) rocked in 2000.WireImage\/FilmMagic    <\/p>\n<p>The spirit of late R&amp;B luminary Aaliyah \u2014 who met her untimely end at 22 in a 2001 plane crash \u2014 was palpable at the 2021 MTV Video Music Awards. And that was all thanks to YouTube makeup and face-contouring diva Bretman Rock, 23, who wowed at the event in the same yellow tiger-striped Roberto Cavalli dress that the \u201cTry Again\u201d chanteuse rocked on the VMAs red carpet in 2000. \u201cI think Bretman had nothing but good intentions here. It was a unique way to keep her memory alive, and that\u2019s a beautiful thing,\u201d\u00a0Vazzana said.<\/p>\n<h2>Staying sharp in Madonna\u2019s cone bra <\/h2>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/02\/madonna-cone-bra.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Madonna, Kylie Jenner and Julia Fox\" \/>Kylie Jenner (center) and Julia Fox (right) both gave a nod to Madonna\u2019s Jean Paul Gaultier cone bra from her 1990 Blond Ambition tour.Getty Images\/Getty Images\/GC Images    <\/p>\n<p>At the peak of her career, Madonna\u2019s style was on point. And the satin, bust-accentuating Jean Paul Gaultier cone bra that the now-63-year-old pop idol wore on her Blond Ambition world tour in the spring of 1990 was the standout of her wardrobe. Which is why Vazzana said that Julia Fox\u2019s denim-sewn take on the look at Paris fashion week \u201cshould not have been [done] \u2026 The Madonna cone bra is such an iconic moment, and even though Julia looks really cool, this is a look that should be exclusive to Madonna.\u201d On the other hand, Jenner \u2014 who tried out the style at the New School\u2019s Parsons Benefit in June \u2014 gave fans \u201ca much more subtle nod to Madonna\u2019s fashion influence, rather than an outright copy,\u201d Vazzana said. \u201cKylie\u2019s [bust isn\u2019t] as pronounced. And that modification honors Madonna\u2019s signature style as the inspiration for this more modern interpretation of a similar design.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Borrowing Britney\u2019s black lace<\/h2>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/02\/kourtney-kardashian-britney-spears.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Britney Spears and Kourtney Kardashian\" \/>Kourtney Kardashian (left) sported a black sheer look that was similar to the one Britney Spears (right) wore on the red carpet in 2001.Evan Agostini\/ImageDirect; kourtneykardash\/Instagram    <\/p>\n<p>A demonstration of solidarity \u2014\u00a0or a shameless grab for the spotlight? In September, Kourtney Kardashian, 42, slipped into a lacy black minidress reminiscent of the sheer piece Spears, 40, memorably wore for the red carpet of the 2001 MTV VMAs (an outfit the singer called \u201cone of my favorite dresses I\u2019ve ever worn\u201d). Kardashian\u2019s move came at the height of the #FreeBritney movement, as the singer fought to win back control of her life and end her conservatorship. But, as in most revived fashion moments, choices like this are a \u201crisk,\u201d Vazzana said, because of the different ways the meaning behind the look could be interpreted.\u00a0\u201cIn this case,\u201d she added, \u201cKourtney was definitely making an honorable nod to Britney, but of course knew she\u2019d get [a lot of] attention doing so.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Beaming in Bianca Jagger\u2019s gown<\/h2>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/02\/bianca-jagger-gerber.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Bianca Jagger and Kia Gerber\" \/>Model Kaia Gerber (right) channeled style icon Bianca Jagger\u2019s Halston gown with an Oscar de la Renta masterpiece at last year\u2019s Met Gala.Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>Kaia Gerber, 20, has got moves like Jagger \u2014 the rocker\u2019s former wife Bianca Jagger, 76, to be exact. At the 2021 Met Gala, the ravishing daughter of runway legend Cindy Crawford channeled the Studio 54 mainstay\u2019s Halston gown she wore to the 1981 Met Gala with a similar Oscar de la Renta masterpiece. Vazzana said this was a shrewd move for Gerber. \u201cThis revived look for Kaia wasn\u2019t about clout. It was about showing the world that she\u2019s not a little kid anymore and she\u2019s not just Cindy Crawford\u2019s daughter,\u201d Vazzana said. \u201cChanneling Bianca was her chic way of establishing herself as a fearless fashion go-getter.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the world of fashion, imitation isn\u2019t just the sincerest form of flattery \u2014 it\u2019s also the fastest route to front-page fame.\u00a0 Starlets are stepping out in recognizable red-carpet pieces worn previously&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":418,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[7],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/417"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=417"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/417\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=417"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=417"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=417"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
