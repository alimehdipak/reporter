And it\u2019s nine days before \u201cMarry Me,\u201d his charming big-screen debut opposite Jennifer Lopez and Owen Wilson, opens on Valentine\u2019s Day weekend.<\/p>\n<p>But despite all the buzz, he\u2019s the picture of chill as he strolls into a Midtown Manhattan studio for his Alexa photo shoot. No doubt, it\u2019s about to get harder for the Colombian reggaeton sensation to walk down the street just minutes away from Times Square without getting mobbed by swooning fans. After all, he\u2019s one of the world\u2019s most eligible bachelors. And while his \u201cMarry Me\u201d character Bastian is getting hitched to fellow pop star Kat Velez (played by Lopez), the happily single Maluma isn\u2019t sure if he\u2019ll ever say those \u201cI do\u2019s.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know if I want to get married,\u201d says the artist, born Juan Luis Londo\u00f1o Arias. \u201cOf course, I want to have a family; I always dreamed about having children. But I don\u2019t know if I will get married \u2026 I\u2019m so young, you know, I don\u2019t have to start thinking about it. But now I\u2019m focusing on my career.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/maluma-alexa-7.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=683\" alt=\"Maluma for Alexa Magazine\" \/>Royalty by Maluma shirt, $80 at Macys; Trousers, $1,250 at Dior Men, 107 Greene St.; \u201cDulcis\u201d earrings, $185 at Swarovski; \u201cDaylight\u201d necklace, $145 at The M Jewelers NY; Petrvs \u201cScarab\u201d signet ring (on Maluma\u2019s left index finger) in 18-k yellow gold, $5,200, and Hex station band (right index finger) in 18-k yellow gold with diamonds, $3,650, both at David Yurman; \u201cCharlotte\u201d 14-k yellow-gold ring (left ring finger), $595 at MejuriKurt Iswarienko    <\/p>\n<p>And a <em>muy caliente<\/em> career it is. He\u2019s currently bopping across the globe on his \u201cPapi Juancho\u201d world tour, which \u2014 named after his 2020 album and alter ego \u2014 sold out Madison Square Garden last October. Winner of both a Latin Grammy and an MTV Video Music Award, Maluma has collaborated with everyone from Madonna and The Weeknd to fellow Colombians Shakira and J Balvin. In addition to \u201cMarry Me,\u201d he voiced the character of Mariano in the Disney hit \u201cEncanto.\u201d And he\u2019s set to launch his Royalty by Maluma clothing line at Macy\u2019s today, after the brand\u2019s cologne hit the department store earlier this month.<\/p>\n<p>He\u2019s certainly learned a lot from watching his \u201cMarry Me\u201d co-star Lopez work her skills as a master multitasker, bouncing from music and movies to fashion and beauty.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was a big fan of Jennifer, but I became more of a fan when I met her in person,\u201d says Maluma. \u201cI love the way she works, the way she handles every situation, how professional she is. I love that about her.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"672\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/maluma-alexa-4.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=672\" alt=\"Maluma for Alexa Magazine\" \/>Royalty by Maluma coat, $150, and shorts, $80, both at Macy\u2019s; Tank, Maluma\u2019s own; Socks, $10 at The Colours Shop; Nike x Sacai x CLOT sneakers, $180 (similar styles) at Nike; \u201cDulcis\u201d earrings, $185 at Swarovski; Herringbone chain necklace, $190 at Mejuri; Medusa necklace, $850 at Versace; Signet ring in 18-k yellow gold with diamonds, $8,500 at David Yurman Kurt Iswarienko    <\/p>\n<p>He\u2019d been angling to work with Lopez through her ex-husband, Marc Anthony. (The guys had collaborated on a salsa version of Maluma\u2019s 2017 hit \u201cFelices los 4.\u201d) \u201cI\u2019m super close with Marc, and I was always telling him that I wanted to work with Jennifer,\u201d he says. \u201cI was like, \u2018Yo, bro, I don\u2019t know if you guys talk or whatever, maybe because you guys have children together. But I want to work with her.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Maluma got his wish when Lopez reached out to him to play \u201cdouchebag\u201d Bastian in \u201cMarry Me.\u201d The two instantly clicked, both as co-stars and music collaborators, releasing the singles \u201cPa\u2019 Ti\u201d and \u201cLonely\u201d in 2020. \u201cThe first time that we worked together, we were in the studio, and it was super fluid,\u201d he recalls. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because she still has Latin roots, you know? So she knows how I feel when I listen to music that I love. We felt that immediate connection.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Their bond extended to shooting a big scene for the rom-com (in which they sing the title tune) on the Bronx-born Lopez\u2019s home turf, during Maluma\u2019s sold-out concert at Madison Square Garden in October 2019. \u201cIt was beautiful \u2026 having Jennifer with me at the Garden,\u201d he says. \u201cShe lived a long time in New York. She was the local.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"663\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/maluma-alexa-2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=663\" alt=\"Maluma for Alexa Magazine\" \/>Sweater vest, $975, pants, $1,295, \u201cBiggie\u201d leather slides, price upon request, Medusa necklace, $850, and La Greca chain bracelet, $595, all similar styles at Versace; Lucent stud earrings, $115 each, both at Swarovski; Signet ring in 18-k yellow gold with diamonds, $8,500 at David YurmanKurt Iswarienko    <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cI love her \u2026 I love what she\u2019s done with her life.\u201d<\/p>\n<p> Maluma on his inspiring friendship with Madonna<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Maluma has also turned to another superstar pop diva \u2014 Madonna \u2014 for advice. The two M\u2019s met at the 2018 VMAs and quickly formed a friendship; he represented his Colombian hometown on their 2019 single \u201cMedell\u00edn.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cShe works harder than me,\u201d he says of the singer, 35 years his senior. \u201cI remember we were recording in LA; we were in the studio for two days in a row. I wanted to f \u2013 \u2013 king go to the hotel, change and take a shower, and she was like, \u2018No, we\u2019re gonna stay right here.\u2019 So if she\u2019s not complaining, why am I gonna complain?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI love her,\u201d he continues. \u201cI love what she\u2019s done with her life.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Like both Madonna and J.Lo before him, Maluma is also striking a pose for Versace. He\u2019s the face of the men\u2019s spring-summer 2022 campaign for the fashion house. \u201cIt reminds me of my grandparents a lot \u2014 they used to love Versace, too,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then I showed them the campaign, and they feel super proud of it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/maluma-alexa-6.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=683\" alt=\"Maluma for Alexa Magazine\" \/>Leather jacket, $7,350, and leather pants, $6,800, both at Louis Vuitton, 116 Greene St.; Faux-fur cowboy hat, $485 at Kelsey Randall; Passionoir M Collection pearl earrings, $4,900 at MikimotoKurt Iswarienko    <\/p>\n<p>And now the \u201cHaw\u00e1i\u201d heartthrob has his own clothing line, Royalty by Maluma. So how exactly did he go from crooner to clothier? \u201cI think that the mind is infinite. You can create whatever you want. And I love fashion,\u201d he says. \u201cI would say the inspiration is coming from my roots, my country, my city, my family \u2026 I love denim, I love different fabrics that remind me of the mountains of Medell\u00edn. Also, the clothes that we were designing for women reminded me a little bit of my mom.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Maluma made sure his line would fit and flatter all body types. \u201cI designed things that everybody can wear \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter the size,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you know how to rock it, you\u2019re gonna feel comfortable with it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The name of his brand, Royalty, was inspired by the love \u2014 and loyalty \u2014 he has been shown from his hometown fans. One of his 30-plus tattoos (he\u2019s \u201clost count\u201d) is a crown on the left side of his neck in honor of them. \u201cI got it because of my fans,\u201d he says. \u201cIf the king has a crown, it\u2019s because the people from the town gave it to him. I felt like the people in my hometown, they were loving my music, they were loving my movement.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/maluma-alexa-8.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=683\" alt=\"Maluma for Alexa Magazine\" \/>Turtleneck, $1,040,  trousers, $1,370, and leather jacket, $10,900, all at Louis Vuitton,  116 Greene St.; \u201cDiscolouis\u201d sneakers, $3,395 at Christian Louboutin, 965 Madison Ave.; \u201cMillenia\u201d stud earrings, $95 at Swarovski; Sunglasses, $260 at IllestevaKurt Iswarienko    <\/p>\n<p>On April 30, Maluma will play for 50,000 fans at the \u201cMedell\u00edn for the World\u201d concert at the Atanasio Girardot stadium. It\u2019s that kind of support that makes him maintain his home base in Medell\u00edn (although he also has a place in Miami). It also keeps him close to his family, who inspired his musical moniker \u2014 a combination of the first two letters of his mother\u2019s name (Marlli), his father\u2019s name (Luis) and his sister\u2019s name (Manuela).<\/p>\n<p>But the star reps for his country wherever he goes, which is why it was so special for him to be a part of \u201cEncanto\u201d \u2014 an animated film about a Colombian family. (He voices Isabela\u2019s hunky fianc\u00e9, Mariano.)<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted to be in the movie so bad that I tried to find a way to record the vocals in the middle of the \u2018Papi Juancho\u2019 tour,\u201d he says. \u201cI love being part of one of the movies that is changing the face of my country. I feel connected with the movie because that\u2019s something that I\u2019m trying to do too right now, you know? I don\u2019t want people to talk about Colombia and think about drugs, about violence, about Pablo Escobar. That\u2019s not Colombia anymore \u2026 we feel proud of being part of the change.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"655\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/maluma-alexa-3.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=655\" alt=\"Maluma for Alexa Magazine\" \/>The singer\u2019s new clothing line, Royalty by Maluma, drops tomorrow at Macy\u2019s. \u201cI designed things that everybody can wear \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter the size,\u201d he says.Kurt Iswarienko    <\/p>\n<p>Although Maluma sings in English for the first time on \u201cMarry Me,\u201d don\u2019t expect him to give up on recording in Spanish. Just check out his sexy new single \u201cCositas de la USA.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a huge fan of American hip-hop: 50 Cent, Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre. I was raised listening to that music,\u201d he says. \u201cBut my favorite is Spanish [language] music \u2026 and I\u2019m not going to change it. It doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m never going to sing in English, of course. But let\u2019s wait for right now.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And while he\u2019s also holding off on any thoughts of marriage, Maluma says he has experienced some \u201cbeautiful relationships.\u201d He dated model Natalia Barulich and then, after they split, was spotted getting cozy with another model, Vivien Rubin. Recently, the self-proclaimed romantic has been linked with Colombian architect Susana G\u00f3mez.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to say that I\u2019m in a relationship, because it\u2019s not like that,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m just letting things go with the flow. You know, I\u2019m just taking care of the people that I love. I\u2019m taking care of my career. Everything is happening in a good way. I\u2019m happy, and I\u2019m at peace with myself.
