The telescope is now stationed about\u00a01 million miles from Earth\u00a0and in the final stages of commissioning.<\/p>\n<p>Michael McElwain, Webb observatory project scientist with NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center, said there are 1,000 steps in the commissioning phase of the telescope to get it ready for scientific observations, with now only about 200 steps left to complete.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re really in the homestretch,\u201d McElwain said.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>After releasing the first image taken by Webb of a star in April, NASA and its international partners shared a new picture on Monday taken during the commissioning of Webb\u2019s instruments.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"781\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/james-webb-space-telescope-images.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"This combination of images provided by NASA on Monday, May 9, 2022, shows part of the Large Magellanic Cloud, a small satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, seen by the retired Spitzer Space Telescope, left, and the new James Webb Space Telescope.\" \/>This combination of images provided by NASA on Monday, May 9, 2022, shows part of the Large Magellanic Cloud, a small satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, seen by the retired Spitzer Space Telescope, left, and the new James Webb Space Telescope.AP    <\/p>\n<p>The Webb science team selected the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, to test the telescope\u2019s Mid-Infrared Instrument or MIRI. The image below shows the same view taken by NASA\u2019s now-retired Spitzer Space Telescope\u2019s Infrared Array Camera on the left and then using Webb\u2019s MIRI on the right.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSpitzer taught us a lot, but this is like a whole new world, just unbelievably beautiful,\u201d said Marcia Rieke, the principal investigator for Webb\u2019s Near-Infrared Camera.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Rieke, an astronomer with the University of Arizona who also worked on the Spitzer telescope, said the team knew Webb\u2019s images would be better because it has 18 mirror segments, each larger than Spitzer\u2019s single mirror.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"542\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/james-webb-space-telescope-image-sharpness.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"In this image released by NASA, engineering images of sharply focused stars in the field of view of each instrument demonstrate that the Webb Telescope is fully aligned and in focus. \" \/>In this image released by NASA, engineering images of sharply focused stars in the field of view of each instrument demonstrate that the Webb Telescope is fully aligned and in focus. NASA\/STScI\/AFP via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not until you actually see the kind of image that it delivers that you really internalize and go, \u2018Wow, just think of what we\u2019re going to learn,&#8217;\u201d Rieke said.<\/p>\n<p>ESA Webb project scientist Chris Evans said Spitzer was limited by spatial resolution. He explained the improved clarity and power of Webb\u2019s MIDI cuts through the dust that would be hidden at visible wavelengths.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUntil now, we\u2019ve been limited by the angular resolution with the Spitzer performance, but suddenly you can resolve those into individual stars. You can see all the structures in that image,\u201d Evans said. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to transform our view of local galaxies, like the Magellanic Clouds. That will allow us to study the properties of stars in these different environments that are more similar to the galaxies in the early universe.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Webb project scientist Klaus Pontoppidan, with the Space Telescope Science Institute, said next, the public can look forward to the first color images from the telescope, known as early release observations or EROs.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/james-webb-space-telescope-packed.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"The James Webb Space Telescope is packed up for shipment to its launch site in Kourou, French Guiana in an undated photograph at Northrop Grumman's Space Park in Redondo Beach, California.\" \/>The James Webb Space Telescope is packed up for shipment to its launch site in Kourou, French Guiana in an undated photograph at Northrop Grumman\u2019s Space Park in Redondo Beach, California.Reuters    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cTheir objective is to demonstrate at the end of commissioning to the world and to the public that Webb is fully operational and that it produces excellent results,\u201d Pontoppidan said of the EROs. \u201cIt\u2019s also an opportunity to celebrate the beginning of many years of Webb science.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Pontoppidan said that the images we have seen from Webb so far are mostly of star fields because they are used to calibrate instruments.<\/p>\n<p>The ERO images will showcase the capability of all four Webb science instruments and cover a wide range of areas, from early universe images to galaxies and exoplanets. The EROs should be released in mid-July.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Scientists have been taking the James Webb Space Telescope for a test drive as they get ready to unleash the most powerful space observatory\u2019s instruments on the universe.
