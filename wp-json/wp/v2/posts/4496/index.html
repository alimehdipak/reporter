Their 15-year union ended in a messy public divorce in 1992 when it was revealed that Donald had been having an affair with actress and model Marla Maples. <\/p>\n<p>Ivana married two more times after Donald, but the pair remained friends throughout the years, resulting in her relevance in pop culture and interviews \u2014 in which she often made quite interesting statements. <\/p>\n<p>Here are some of her more remarkable moments that brought Ivana even more notoriety than being married to Donald. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/ivana-featues-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Ivana Trump, ex-wife of Donald Trump, has dropped many memorable statements over the years.\" \/>Ivana Trump, ex-wife of Donald Trump, dropped many memorable statements over the years.Getty Images    <\/p>\n<h2>She won\u2019t say \u2018Marla Maples\u2019<\/h2>\n<p>When Donald was in office, Ivana joked that she was the real first lady since she married the billionaire before his current wife, Melania. While Ivana said she didn\u2019t have much of a relationship with the current Mrs. Trump, she was at least able to say her name in an interview with the Atlantic in 2019 \u2014 something she couldn\u2019t do for Donald\u2019s mistress-turned-second wife Maples. <\/p>\n<p>\u201c[Ivanka] likes [Melania] fine,\u201d Ivana said about her daughter\u2019s relationship with her stepmother. \u201cBecause she didn\u2019t cause me to break up the marriage like the other one \u2014 I don\u2019t even want to pronounce her name,\u201d Ivana\u00a0quipped. <\/p>\n<p>Donald got together with Maples while he was still married to Ivana in 1992. The affair had reportedly been going on since 1989 and resulted in Donald\u2019s first divorce in 1992. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"749\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/marla-maples.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Donald Trump and then-girlfriend Marla Maples in  New York City in 1992.\" \/>Trump and then-girlfriend Marla Maples in New York City in 1992.Getty Images    <\/p>\n<h2>Her cameo in \u2018The First Wives Club\u2019<\/h2>\n<p>Ivana turned the real-life messiness she experienced through the divorce into a quick movie role in \u201cThe First Wives Club.\u201d She didn\u2019t say much in the flick, but she said just enough to ruffle Donald\u2019s feathers. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cLadies, you have to be strong and independent,\u201d she advised actresses Goldie Hawn, Diane Keaton and Bette Midler in a key scene. \u201cAnd remember, don\u2019t get mad \u2014 get everything!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Donald was not tickled by his ex-wife\u2019s cameo, later telling shock jock Howard Stern that she was \u201cout of control\u201d for taking part in the 1996 movie.

In 2015, the Daily Beast published a report saying that she accused him in court documents of raping her during their marriage. <\/p>\n<p>Donald\u2019s lawyer, Michael Cohen, responded to Daily Beast reporter Tim Mak, threatening that he would \u201cmess his life up\u201d if he wrote the story about the rape allegations, adding \u201cyou cannot rape your spouse.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ivana seemingly backtracked on her statement, suggesting she made the claim out of anger.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI have recently read some comments attributed to me from nearly 30 years ago at a time of very high tension during my divorce from Donald. The story is totally without merit,\u201d Ivana said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0to CNN. \u201cDonald and I are the best of friends and together have raised three children that we love and are very proud of. I have nothing but fondness for Donald and wish him the best of luck on his campaign.

But that didn\u2019t mean his ex-wife wouldn\u2019t give him advice on what he should do as commander-in-chief. <\/p>\n<p>In fact, Ivana claimed to be the person who suggested that the Republican president should start using Twitter. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI said, \u2018I think you should tweet.
