Emoji 15.0 is set to be approved this September, Emojipedia noted. <\/p>\n<p>Among the new symbols are pink, light blue and gray hearts, as well as a moose, wing, donkey, goose, jellyfish, ginger, flute, pea pod, maracas, WiFi symbol and a hyacinth.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cActual vendor designs will vary from those released by major vendors [such as Apple, Google and Microsoft], and Emojipedia\u2019s own sample images may also be updated when Emoji 15.0 final is released,\u201d\u00a0said Emojipedia\u2019s Editor-in-Chief Keith Broni.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>He also noted that \u201cthis is only a draft emoji list\u201d and \u201ceach emoji is subject to change prior to final approval in September 2022.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The news comes just a few days before World Emoji Day, July 17. In honor of the day, a new survey indicated that seven in 10 Americans believe messages are \u201cincomplete\u201d without an emoji.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/Emojipedia-80.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Emojipedia\" \/>Thirty-one new emojis will be coming to smartphones next year.Emojipedia    <\/p>\n<p>The poll was conducted by OnePoll on behalf of\u00a0Duolingo\u00a0and\u00a0Slack, and showed how individuals perceive different emojis.<\/p>\n<p>Poll-takers were asked what meaning they were most likely to associate with certain emoticons. The survey inquired 9,400 people and revealed how Americans are more likely to find emoji-less texts or messages to be lacking.<\/p>\n<p>For example, when shown the \u201cmoney with wings\u201d () emoji, respondents were divided on if it meant a loss of money (28%) or an inflow of money (31%).<\/p>\n<p>The \u201cslightly smiling face ()\u201d may not be as positive as others may think. While some identify it as \u201cfeeling happy\u201d (38%), several people also use it to show \u201cdeep exasperation and\/or distrust\u201d (14%).<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/Emoji6.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Emoji\" width=\"618\" height=\"501\" \/>Many employees who were surveyed noted that using emojis in the workplace helped with increased communication between workers.     <\/p>\n<p>Thirty-one percent of Gen Zers and 24% of millennials are also more likely to reveal that an emoji they\u2019ve sent was wrongly misunderstood by the receiver.<\/p>\n<p>The research indicated that the poop emoji () was ranked third on a list of symbols to not send your boss. The infamous eggplant emoji  () took third for the emoticon not to send to a co-worker.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEmojis let people convey a broad range of emotions efficiently, and in a way that words sometimes can\u2019t,\u201d Olivia Grace, senior director of product management at Slack, noted in the study. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/Emoji5.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Emoji\" \/>The poll indicated how people misread and misunderstand emojis.        <\/p>\n<p>\u201cPlus, when widely accepted as part of the workplace language, they go a long way in increasing efficiency by replacing follow-up messages and reducing noise,\u201d Grace went on. <\/p>\n<p>She added: \u201cA simple thumbs-up emoji to express approval, an \u2018eyes\u2019 emoji to say \u2018I\u2019ll take a look,\u2019 or a checkmark to say \u2018this is done\u2019 all add efficiency compared to back-and-forth messages.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear from the results that people are using emoji like any other system of communication: meaning can be subtle, and they\u2019re used differently in various settings,\u201d said Dr. Hope Wilson, learning and curriculum manager at Duolingo.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Apple is thinking pink with its latest round of emojis.
