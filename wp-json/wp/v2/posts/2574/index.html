year.<\/p>\n<p>This morning, a Falcon 9 rocket carrying 53 Starlink satellites made a successful launch and left behind a fascinating glow in the sky.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBasically, what\u2019s happening is, it\u2019s still dark outside, but you have the sun illuminating the plume as it\u2019s in space,\u201d a SpaceX executive said.<\/p>\n<p>The rocket took off at 5.43 am this morning from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.<\/p>\n<p>When the Falcon 9 rocket lifts off with almost two million pounds of thrust, the fuel is exploded in a combustion chamber.<\/p>\n<p>In a paper published by the Glenn Research Center, NASA wrote \u201cThe combustion produces hot exhaust which is passed through a nozzle to accelerate the flow and produce thrust.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The hot exhaust was illuminated as the Falcon 9 reached heights where sun rays were beginning to fill the early morning sky.<\/p>\n<p>Musk tweeted \u201cAnother Starlink mission completed\u201d after the satellites were deposited in orbit.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/space3.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"On Friday, May 6 at
