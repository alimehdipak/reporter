A <a href=\"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/view\/blogbuzz\/sites\/houston-dental-implant-center\">dentistry practice in Bellaire, TX<\/a> can assess your options for replacing one or more missing teeth with natural-looking teeth. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Medical professionals can help you decide which option is best for you by debunking these five common myths about tooth replacements.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Dental Implants Are Purely Aesthetic Or Cosmetic.<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Some argue that all implants were originally intended, like natural teeth, but we don\u2019t know if that is true with certainty. In any case, implants are generally said to be stuck on the outside of your natural teeth and that is where they stay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The structure of your teeth is important for implants, among other benefits. Teeth that have living roots provide additional support from below the gumline and applied positive stress to provide a natural shape for your jaw. Bone loss is one of the side effects of missing teeth, which are supported by mandibular bones being rebuilt. The natural structural system of the mouth is lost when mandibular bones recede again with the disappearance of teeth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dental implants are a replication of the entire tooth&#8217;s structure including the root. They help your teeth maintain the same alignment and shape as they used to, as well as preserve bone loss and facial architecture.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Implants Are Not Highly Successful<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dental implants are very successful because trial and error was the initial experience the dentist had. The success rate for dental implants is somewhere between 95% and 98% with use of biocompatible materials and modern dental advanced technology.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Dental Implants Aren\u2019t As Durable And Strong As Natural Teeth<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With osseointegration, implant dentistry can now approximate natural teeth with an alternative solution that\u2019s affordable, comfortable, and safe.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Implants Require Too Much Care.<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you look after your natural teeth and maintain the implants, they can last for years, even decades. The prevalence of the dental implant-related disease has declined steadily due to hygiene, daily care routine, and regular prosthetic replacement.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Dental Implants Are Too Expensive.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;The up-front cost of dental implants is high, but the long-term costs are lower.&#8221; Removing your tooth and replacing it with a dental implant can save money over time because patients aren&#8217;t constantly replacing their healthy crowns.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When you get dental implants, you replace your missing teeth forever, and they also prevent your jawbone from atrophying so you\u2019ll have fewer expensive medical bills in the future. For example, with Implants, you&#8217;ll never be stressed out again with costly dental appointments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are also financing options that allow you to decide which option is best for you and help you get the <a href=\"https:\/\/blogbuzzers.jimdofree.com\/2022\/04\/26\/dental-implant-in-bellaire-tx\/\">dental implants<\/a> you have always wanted<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Are you considering dental implants, but are nervous because of the myths that you&#8217;ve heard?
