Check the packaging<\/h2>\n<p>With Apple charging up to $37 for a charging cable on its website, it\u2019s understandable that consumers tend to purchase from elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re buying a wire from a third-party seller, make sure it\u2019s certified by Apple by looking carefully at the accessory\u2019s packaging.<\/p>\n<p>Certified third-party accessories have Apple\u2019s\u00a0MFi\u00a0badge on\u00a0their packaging, which says \u201cMade for iPod, iPhone, iPad.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>2. Look at the cable<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s a good idea to compare your cable to one from Apple. Counterfeit accessories tend to feel thinner and lighter in the hand.<\/p>\n<p>Apple cables also have their own markers of authenticity.<\/p>\n<p>According to the company: \u201cAn Apple Lightning to USB cable has \u2018Designed by Apple in California\u2019 and either \u2018Assembled in China\u2019, \u2018Assembled in Vietnam\u2019 or \u2018Ind\u00fastria Brasileira\u2019 on the cable about seven inches from the USB connector.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see a 12-digit serial number at the end of this text.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>3. Investigate the Lightning connector<\/h2>\n<p>The Lightning connector on fakes is typically rough and unfinished.<\/p>\n<p>According to Apple: \u201cYou can use the Lightning connector, USB connector, and laser etchings to identify counterfeit or uncertified Lightning accessories.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Phony connectors may have a \u201crough or inconsistent finish\u201d and \u201csquared contacts with an uneven surface\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>The company helpfully provides images to illustrate its point on a\u00a0support page\u00a0on its website.<\/p>\n<h2>Why are counterfeit cables dangerous?<\/h2>\n<p>Fake chargers are often made with poor quality components that fail to meet UK safety regulations.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re keen to avoid Apple\u2019s own pricey cables, it\u2019s advised you buy them from reputable retailers.<\/p>\n<p>Electrical Safety First, a charity committed to reduce deaths and injuries caused by electrical accidents, tested a range of fake chargers.<\/p>\n<p>They reported that 98 percent \u201cput consumers at risk of lethal electric shock and fire\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Martyn Allen, Technical Director at Electrical Safety First, said: \u201cThis report shows that anyone purchasing an iPhone charger from an online marketplace or at an independent discount store is taking serious risk with their safety.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Further research by ESF showed 85 percent of consumers shop for electrical items online, where it is very hard to spot a fake.<\/p>\n<p>The London Fire Brigade has issued their own warnings about the dangers of fake chargers.<\/p>\n<p>Their investigation found that while Apple iPhone chargers have 60 or more components in them, counterfeits have less than half that.<\/p>\n<p>Fire investigator Andrew Vaughan-Davies asked: \u201cFor the sake of saving a few pounds is it worth putting the lives of your family at risk and potentially destroying your home?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Investigators also said that these chargers have the potential to cause damage to the phone being charged.<\/p>\n<p><em>This article originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission. <\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you\u2019ve cheaped out on your iPhone cable, you could be in for a shock.
