And the Old Trafford hierarchy could hand him up to \u20ac300 million, with the aim of getting United back to the top of the Premier League.<\/p>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p>One of those expected to depart is Rashford. The England international&#8217;s contract ends in 2023 and he is seemingly not part of Ten Hag&#8217;s future plans, despite the club having the option to add another year on to his deal.<\/p>\n<p>Rashford has endured a tough season, with injuries limiting the impact he has had and just five goals in 30 appearances across all competitions for United so far.<\/p>\n<p>Barcelona appreciate the 24-year-old&#8217;s potential and versatility as a striker, but it is felt that this could be a tough deal for the club economically. They are monitoring the transfer market with their previous priority, Borussia Dortmund&#8217;s Erling Haaland, out of reach financially, while Bayern Munich&#8217;s 33-year-old striker Robert Lewandowski is seen as the most realistic option.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; ESPN+ guide: LaLiga, Bundesliga, MLS, FA Cup, more (U.S.)<br \/>&#8211; Stream ESPN FC Daily on ESPN+ (U.S. only)<br \/>&#8211; Don&#8217;t have ESPN?

The LaLiga side feels a deal would be too difficult to complete in the summer considering how close it would be to his initial \u20ac50m move to England. <i>Los Blancos<\/i> are in the process of overhauling their midfield and, after previously signing Eduardo Camavinga, they are also looking at AS Monaco&#8217;s Aurelien Tchouameni.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Barcelona want to sign Valencia&#8217;s Carlos Soler, reports Diario Sport, which adds that this could come in the summer or when the midfielder&#8217;s contract ends in 2023. With that said, the two clubs have a good working relationship and the priority is to find an economic agreement that suits both. <i>Los Che<\/i> left-back Jose Gaya has also been linked, but a deal for Soler is closer to being completed.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Giorgio Chiellini is considering leaving Juventus at the end of the season and is tempted by a possible move to Major League Soccer, as reported by Fabrizio Romano.

They feel the Frenchman could act as deputy for Marcelo Brozovic while also fulfilling other roles in their midfield.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Arsenal and Newcastle United are monitoring the situation of Fulham striker Aleksandar Mitrovic, according to Ekrem Konur. The Serbia international has made an incredible impact in the Championship this season, contributing a remarkable 40 goals and seven assists in 40 league matches so far.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Arsenal hope to keep Eddie Nketiah past his current contract, but Crystal Palace and Borussia Monchengladbach are among the clubs trying to sign him, reports The Daily Mail. The 22-year-old&#8217;s deal ends in June but he has so far turned down any offers from the Gunners due to frustrations around a lack of game time. The striker made his first two Premier League starts of the season in the last two matches, the latter of which saw him score a brace against Chelsea.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The summer transfer window is approaching, and there&#8217;s plenty of gossip swirling about who&#8217;s moving where.
