Unfortunately I want to notify everyone with bad news.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>As of Thursday morning, Fridge No More\u2019s app displayed a message to would-be customers: \u201cSORRY WE\u2019RE TEMPORARILY CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE,\u201d attributing the shutdown to \u201ctechnical issues.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The news comes less than a week after another rapid grocery delivery app with Russian ties, Buyk, abruptly suspended operations and furloughed 98% of its employees, as first reported by The Post.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Buyk attributed the suspension both to US sanctions on Russian banks in retaliation for the invasion of Ukraine \u2014 as well as restrictions on Russian money leaving the country that were imposed by President Vladimir Putin.\u00a0The company now says it\u2019s looking to sell itself, raise American money or declare bankruptcy. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/buyk-grocery-app-04-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Buyk\" \/>Buyk abruptly shut down last week. Noam Galai    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt just happened at Buyk last week so we already knew the story,\u201d a Fridge No More employee told The Post. \u201cRight now the staff all thinks that it\u2019s because of the war.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The abrupt nature of the shutdown left \u201ceveryone irate,\u201d the employee said. <\/p>\n<p>Fridge No More\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Pavel Danilov, is from Russia. And the company\u2019s investors include Altair Capital, a venture capital fund led by investor Igor Ryabenkiy with operations in Russia, the US and Israel.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Fridge No More did not respond to a request for comment and has not released any statements about the shutdown.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/fridge-no-more-03.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Fridge No More\" \/>The abrupt nature of Fridge No More\u2019s shutdown left \u201ceveryone irate,\u201d an employee said. Courtesy of @fridgenomore    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cBecause a lot of their funding comes from overseas, primary Russia, they just got hit by the same circumstances,\u201d Brittain Ladd, a retail consultant who\u2019s an adviser to rapid delivery companies, said of Buyk and Fridge No More. \u201cSources inside Fridge No More have confirmed to me that they\u2019ve lost their funding because of events in Ukraine.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBuyk lost the ability to operate because they had no funding,\u201d Ladd added. \u201cFridge No More is basically the same type of company. It\u2019s a Russia-founded company, It\u2019s a Russian investor-backed company.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>In apparent bids to save themselves, executives from both Fridge No More and Buyk have spoken to Doordash and Grubhub in recent months about potentially being acquired, sources said. <\/p>\n<p>As Fridge No More employees scrambled for more information about Wednesday\u2019s shutdown, they circulated a screenshot of what appeared to be an email from Danilov to members of upper management about a \u201cdeal timeline\u201d with Doordash.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI understand that all of you have already had interviews with Doordash (DD) team and currently you are waiting for the feedback,\u201d Danilov apparently wrote. \u201cEmployment with [Fridge No More] ends for everyone, including myself, on March 31st\u2026 Employment with DD starts on April 1st for those who received and accepted their offers.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>But the Post could not confirm the authenticity of the email and a source close to Doordash said that \u201cit is not true\u201d that Doordash is buying Fridge No More.<\/p>\n<p>Even with the demise of Buyk and Fridge No More, the rapid delivery space in New York City is still crowded. Remaining companies include Gorillas, Gopuff, Jokr and Getir. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Another 15-minute grocery delivery app bites the dust.
