That league has been a beast this year and in the second half of the season, no teams have played a tougher strength of schedule than those teams. That being said, Minnesota is loaded, Michigan is loaded, and the question is who has the better team. I think it is Minnesota; the most-skilled teams usually never win this thing. UMass is coming out of a weaker Hockey East than usual. I think they will rise to the challenge, but they are little thin in some key areas. And the amount of quality defensemen in this tournament is impressive.<\/p>\n<p>Sean Ritchlin: The West has been dominating all year. With the NCHC getting five teams, the Big Ten getting three and the CCHA two, it looks like a year when the Frozen Four winner comes from the West. Could this be the year the Big Ten breaks through and wins a title? Michigan and Minnesota are fun to watch, but those teams are younger and many of the players will be playing in the NCAA tourney for the first time.<\/p>\n<h2>What players are you most looking forward to watching?<\/h2>\n<p>Starman: If North Dakota&#8217;s Jake Sanderson gets healthy, he&#8217;s one to watch for sure. Owen Power of Michigan is unreal, but Sanderson is just as good and his game climbed this season.<\/p>\n<p>The Michigan quartet of Kent Johnson, Power, Matty Beniers and Mackie Samoskevich is always fun to watch. So is Ben Meyers of Minnesota. For goaltenders, Quinnipiac freshman Yaniv Perets has been impressive and Dryden McKay of Minnesota State is a great story.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/college-sports\/story\/_\/id\/33558718\/\" \/>With a veteran group led by goalie Dryden McKay, Minnesota State could be poised for its first national title.\u00a0Richard T Gagnon\/Getty Images<\/p>\n<p>Ritchlin: Luke Hughes has really developed into a dominant force for Michigan as a freshman. Having Power go to the Olympics gave him an opportunity to be the No. 1 guy and he never looked back. He has elite deception and the ability to create offense from anywhere on the ice. The Gophers have as good a defensive six as anyone in the country: Jackson LaCombe and Brock Faber headline the crew.<\/p>\n<p>Minnesota Duluth&#8217;s Noah Cates is a great senior leader and Denver&#8217;s Bobby Brink has piled up a ton of assists. Western Michigan&#8217;s Ethen Frank can pile pucks in the net and the Broncos will need him to get his confidence early.<\/p>\n<p>Bobby Trivigno of UMass plays the game the right way and provides that combination of leadership and skill teams need to win a tourney. If the Minutemen are going to go back-to-back, he has to be the best player in the tourney.<\/p>\n<p>At Minnesota State, Julian Napravnik and Nathan Smith have been in the tourney several times and bring leadership and confidence. This is a team built to win a title, with an older, more experienced crew and possibly the best goalie in the country in Dryden McKay.<\/p>\n<h2>What first-round game and\/or second-round matchup is the most intriguing?<\/h2>\n<p>Starman: An interesting matchup to me is St. Cloud&#8217;s offense against Quinnipiac&#8217;s defense. Quinnipiac plays defense really well. They defend hard, they get in position, they take away the middle very well, they pack it in when they have to. Now don&#8217;t get fooled by St. Cloud&#8217;s record, they play in the NCHC, where basically you&#8217;re playing a top-15 team every week. They can fly, they go three lines deep, they&#8217;ve got four defensemen who can go. It will be interesting to see if Quinnipiac can slow down what has become a very good possession, high-flying, free-wheeling offense that plays with no fear in St. Cloud.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/photo\/2022\/0320\/r989291_1296x1296_1-1.jpg&amp;w=130&amp;h=130&amp;scale=crop&amp;location=center\" width=\"65\" height=\"65\" \/><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Ritchlin: UMass, the defending champs, against Minnesota is a great test for both teams. The Gophers are very deep and play a solid 200-foot game. UMass has continued to improve all season and appears healthy and ready to make a run for a third straight Frozen Four. For a second-round game, the buzz would be huge for a Minnesota Duluth-Denver game in Loveland. If that happens, it should be a classic.<\/p>\n<h2>What teams do you think have a shot at winning it all?<\/h2>\n<p>Starman: My mentor, John Davidson, always said don&#8217;t make predictions, they just piss coaches off that you have to work with. I will say that I think there are seven teams that could win it and that Denver is absolutely loaded and, to me, is the best team heading into this. They have that combination of enough good players and depth, and are playing with a style that can give opponents fits. There&#8217;s no ego in that group.<\/p>\n<p>Ritchlin: This tournament is wide open with so many unknowns. There are probably 10 teams that have a shot to win it, but I&#8217;ll narrow it a bit to the four No. 1 seeds &#8212; Michigan, Minnesota State, Western Michigan and Denver &#8212; plus Minnesota Duluth and Minnesota.<\/p>\n<h2>Teams at a glance<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/college-sports\/story\/_\/id\/33558718\/\" \/>UMass is back in the NCAA tournament and is looking to become back-to-back national champions\u00a0Richard T Gagnon\/Getty Images<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/ncaa\/500\/130.png&amp;h=60&amp;w=60\" width=\"30\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Michigan (29-9-1)<\/h2>\n<p>How did they get here: Big Ten champ<br \/>Seed: No. 1 in Allentown<\/p>\n<p>With a roster that includes four of the top five picks in the 2021 NHL draft, the Wolverines lead the nation in star power. As a result, they&#8217;ve had players miss time to play in the Olympics and the World Juniors but still finished second in the Big Ten behind Minnesota, then avenged four regular-season losses to Notre Dame by beating the Irish in the tournament semifinals and topping the Gophers in the title game.<\/p>\n<p>This is Michigan&#8217;s 39th NCAA appearance, tied with Minnesota for the most of all time.

(They outshot Harvard 49-17 in the loss to Harvard in the ECAC final.) The Bobcats have allowed just 42 goals in 40 games, with freshman Yaniv Perets posting a 0.97 GAA and 11 shutouts in 28 games.<\/p>\n<p>This is Quinnipiac&#8217;s eighth NCAA appearance and seventh in the last nine tournaments.

Even so, the defending national runner-up cannot be taken lightly given the competition level in the NCHC and the team&#8217;s experience in big games. Plus, the Huskies have the best power play in the country (.315 success rate).<\/p>\n<p>This is St. Cloud State&#8217;s 15th NCAA appearance since 2000.

The Yellow Jackets started the season 3-9, but have been on a tear since then and are averaging 5.4 goals in their last five games.<\/p>\n<p>This is AIC&#8217;s third straight NCAA appearance.

They lead the nation in goal differential by a mile, averaging nearly three goals a game more than their opponents, as they&#8217;re No. 1 in goals scored (165) and second in goals allowed (51).<\/p>\n<p>Minnesota State has made four straight NCAA tournaments and seven of the last nine.

The big issue with North Dakota is health, particularly for Jake Sanderson, who is one of the best defensemen in the country but whose status is unclear. Even so, the Fighting Hawks were 11-3 without Sanderson this season.<\/p>\n<p>This is North Dakota&#8217;s 34th NCAA appearance; the Fighting Hawks have missed out only three times since 1997.

It&#8217;s all part of a 13-3-1 spurt and an improbable NCAA appearance. Harvard must be taken seriously, though, as it is just outside the top 10 nationally in both scoring offense and defense.<\/p>\n<p>This is Harvard&#8217;s 26th NCAA appearance, and its fifth in six opportunities.
