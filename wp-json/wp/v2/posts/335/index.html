We know what&#8217;s coming, but there is a big excitement around this fixture.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nice to avoid the English clubs, it&#8217;s always nice to play European teams.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Asked about the prospect of having no Chelsea fans at either leg, Tuchel added: &#8220;In general I think this game changes so much with spectators so hopefully we find a solution and I&#8217;m pretty sure everyone at the club, the board, will fight for a chance.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Hopefully we make it happen somehow.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Real Madrid, beaten by Chelsea in last season&#8217;s semifinals, are 10 points clear at the top of LaLiga while Tuchel&#8217;s side are third in the Premier League.<\/p>\n<p>Liverpool will consider a clash with Benfica as the best option from the draw and they could even face Premier League title rivals Manchester City in the final in Paris.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/soccer\/uefa-champions-league\/story\/4619502\/\" \/>The Champions League quarterfinal and semifinal took place at UEFA&#8217;s headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland.\u00a0FABRICE COFFRINI\/AFP via Getty Images<\/p>\n<p>City will have to get past the considerable challenge of Atletico Madrid though &#8212; a clash that will be a fascinating contrast in styles and a tactical battle between Pep Guardiola and Diego Simeone.<\/p>\n<p>It will be the first meeting between the two clubs.<\/p>\n<p>Atletico coach Diego Simeone said of being drawn to play City: &#8220;Above all a great admiration for [Pep] Guardiola, and for the work he&#8217;s been doing at City in recent years, which is shown game after game. After that, it&#8217;s a difficult competition, they are great ties between all the teams. We&#8217;ll have time to assess the game, now we focus on our game against Rayo Vallecano, that&#8217;s all I have in my head.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The fixtures will be confirmed shortly, but as both Madrid teams have been drawn at home in the second leg of the quarterfinals, it is expected one tie will be reversed. As Atletico Madrid qualified as Spanish champions, their tie will remain unaltered, while Real Madrid&#8217;s game against Chelsea should be reversed and the second leg held at Stamford Bridge.
