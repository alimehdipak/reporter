Your reactions to these situations in life may affect your heart health. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Chronic stress is harmful to the body and can lead to serious health issues<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Chronic stress can lead to a number of health issues, including heart disease, high blood pressure, chest pains, or irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">). <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Today, the top cardiologists at NWCC reveal how stress can affect your heart and some simple tips to manage stress throughout your day<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>How Can Stress Affect Your Heart?\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Stress is a normal part of life<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. It\u2019s how we deal with stress that can affect our health and wellbeing. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When you feel stressed, your body releases chemicals called \u2018stress hormones\u2019 to help you cope with the situation<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. These hormones are designed to protect us from danger, but when they are released too often, they can have negative effects on our bodies. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When you are under chronic stress, your body will release more of these hormones than usual<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>How to Relieve stress<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When your body is under stress, it releases adrenaline, which temporarily increases your heart rate, breathing, and blood pressure<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Adrenaline is a hormone produced by the body when there is an emergency situation<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Your body reacts differently to different types of stress<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. It could cause headaches, back or stomach pains or you could also feel irritated, cranky, or tired, for example. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Chronic stress can last from hours to weeks and cause high blood pressure which increases your risk of heart attacks and strokes<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fortunately, there are several ways to <a href=\"https:\/\/probuzz.mystrikingly.com\/blog\/cardiologist-in-houston-texas-77090\">deal<\/a> with stress<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1.
