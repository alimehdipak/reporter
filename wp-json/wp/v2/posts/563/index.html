Select Start and Connect your Bank.<\/h3>\n<p>In QuickBooks Online, select Start, then Connect Your Bank. Next, select Get Started. This will open a new window that will allow you to verify the information you have already entered.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re the sole business owner, you are likely the company&#8217;s principal officer. QuickBooks Online asks for information regarding the company&#8217;s principal officer, such as legal full name, Social Security number, date of birth and home address.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>After you have provided your company&#8217;s principal offer, find your bank under Add a new bank. Once you have found and selected your bank, manually key in the routing number and account number you wish you have payroll funds drawn against.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>QuickBooks Online allows you to link your bank account by signing in to your bank for verification.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>After linking your bank account, add a personal identification number as another means of keeping your account protected. QuickBooks Online will send a small deposit to your account for you to verify. Your bank will list this credit as &#8220;Intuit: Verify Bank&#8221; or &#8220;QuickBooks: Verify Bank.&#8221; The deposit will be less than $1.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>You will then receive a verification email in which you&#8217;ll confirm the amount of the deposit. Once this is done, your account will be verified. If you do not receive the email, you can log in to your QuickBooks Online account and verify the deposit amount by going to Overview, then Let&#8217;s Go, then Check Your Account for Small Deposit.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h3>2. Have each employee complete an authorization for direct deposit form.\u00a0<\/h3>\n<p>Once you have verified your bank account with QuickBooks Online, the next step is to manually input your employees&#8217; information. Simply print the authorization for direct deposit form and have each employee fill it out. Keep these forms on file, either digitally or physically.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>A voided check must accompany each completed direct deposit form. This provides you with routing numbers and account numbers for all employees so you can enter them into QuickBooks Online to set up direct deposit.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how to access the authorization for direct deposit form in QuickBooks Online:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click on Taxes and Forms.<\/li>\n<li>Select Employee and Contractor Setup.<\/li>\n<li>Select Authorization for Direct Deposit.<\/li>\n<li>Select Bank Verification and then View.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>After completing the steps above, you can print copies so your employees can fill them out. Most small business owners prefer all employees to sign up for direct deposit, as it makes payroll more efficient and eliminates the need to print checks for some employees.<\/p>\n<p>Looking for paperless payroll options?

From here, you can enter employee information, such as name, date of birth, hire date, type of pay and any tax details.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Under each employee, there is an option for How Do You Want to Pay? next to the employee&#8217;s name.Should your method of payment be direct deposit, select that option.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Once you have selected the direct deposit option, enter the employee&#8217;s banking information. Don&#8217;t forget to select Done after keying it in.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h3>4.
