Each side agreed to pay a $1 billion breakup fee if the deal falls through under certain conditions \u2013 such as Musk losing financing for the offer or Twitter\u2019s acceptance of another unsolicited third-party offer.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and completion of regulatory review and Twitter\u2019s stockholder approval,\u201d Twitter said in a press release. \u201cThe transaction, which is expected to close in 2022, has been approved by the board of directors of Twitter.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Twitter declined to provide guidance about its upcoming financial results and withdrew its preexisting forecasts, citing Musk\u2019s pending acquisition of the company.<\/p>\n<p>Shares were flat in premarket trading following its earnings release.

I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law. If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect.
