But did you know fillers can be beneficial in fighting acne scars too? If you struggle with acne, you probably know that if <a href=\"https:\/\/blogbuzzers.wordpress.com\/2021\/07\/16\/what-is-the-difference-between-sun-poisoning-vs-sunburn-ask-the-villages-dermatologist\/\">acne<\/a> weren\u2019t bad enough, the scars it leaves behind are the hardest to deal with. Read along to find out what our <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dermatologist <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">says about fillers and how they can help reverse acne scars.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>What Is Filler?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Filler is a generic term that describes a substance filled or injected into the skin to add structure and volume. They are of two types: hyaluronic acid fillers and biostimulatory fillers. Both of these types help with collagen. But they work differently. Hyaluronic acid fillers attract and hold their weight around 1,000 times in water and give a plumping effect. Biostimulatory fillers, on the other hand, act as building blocks for the body to improve the production of its own collagen.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>How Can Fillers Help Acne Scars?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As mentioned earlier, fillers can be used to treat depressed acne scars. They do so by helping to elevate the volume loss and indentations caused by acne \u2014thus creating smoother skin. With the help of dermal fillers, you can effectively treat certain <a href=\"https:\/\/www.publishingbooth.com\/health\/what-natural-things-can-help-with-acne-and-acne-scarring\/\">acne scars<\/a>, like boxcar scars and rolling scars.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Procedure For Fillers For Acne Scars<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before starting the procedure, your dermatologist will ask you to share your allergy and medical history. Moreover, they will likely conduct a test to make sure you\u2019re not allergic to a substance that the filler contains. In this test, a small amount of collagen is injected into the patient\u2019s forearm, which is then monitored for any reaction. Your doctor will proceed with your appointment if you\u2019re not allergic to your filler. They will likely mark your face to be sure where to inject. You don\u2019t have to worry about the pain as each syringe of filler contains lidocaine. This substance is a numbing agent that prevents pain sensations during the procedure. Your procedure can take around 15 minutes to one hour, depending on how bad your scars are and the size of that area.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Is This a Permanent Solution?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In some cases, patients with repeated injections require some maintenance, typically every 6 to 12 months. However, hyaluronic acid fillers can help stimulate new collagen formation. This will allow patients to go years between touch-ups after their initial scarring correction. But it is advisable to use products that further help stimulate collagen, like topical peptides and retinoids, after the procedure.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Are There Any Risks Or Side Effects?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like any cosmetic procedure, you can expect some risks and side effects while getting filler treatment for acne scarring. Fillers can cause swelling, redness, discoloration and lumping at the injection area, and allergic reactions. However, most side effects resolve on their own. Fillers can also cause blood vessel occlusion. It is caused when a blood vessel gets blocked, causing the skin to break down. But this side effect is rare for acne scarring fillers. It is rare because fillers are often placed superficially. Your doctor will place them where the risk of occluding a major blood vessel is improbable.
