He hasn&#8217;t been ruled out of that event.<\/p>\n<p>His departure in the 200 opens a less-challenging path for Noah Lyles, the defending world champion, 18-year-old Erriyon Knighton and top-ranked Kenny Bednarek, all of whom advanced. The trio had the top three times, led by Lyles at 19.62 seconds.<\/p>\n<p>Later Tuesday, Alison Dos Santos of Brazil powered down the homestretch to take the 400-meter hurdles title.<\/p>\n<p>The underdog even if he had the fastest time and No. 1 ranking coming in, Dos Santos held off a decorated field that included the world-record holder. Dos Santos finished in a championship-record time of 46.29 seconds. Americans Rai Benjamin and Trevor Bassitt won the silver and bronze.<\/p>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p>Olympic champion and world-record holder Karsten Warholm of Norway has been dealing with hamstring issues and didn&#8217;t have his trademark kick at the finish. He wound up seventh.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve only been focusing on getting ready, and today I went all or nothing, and unfortunately it was nothing,&#8221; Warholm said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve just got to live with that.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Warholm, Benjamin and Dos Santos have formed the Big Three in the event. So any time they don&#8217;t end up on the podium it&#8217;s a shocker.<\/p>\n<p>The 24-year-old Bassitt used the underdog card to his advantage. After the race, he replicated NBA standout Steph Curry&#8217;s iconic &#8220;night, night&#8221; gesture.<\/p>\n<p>No one will sleep on him again.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I knew for me there really wasn&#8217;t that much pressure from the outside,&#8221; Bassitt said. &#8220;I knew if I got a medal people would be shocked. I knew if I didn&#8217;t get a medal it would be like, &#8216;OK, he really wasn&#8217;t supposed to.&#8217; I feel like I belong in that pedigree in that group of three. I feel like today proved it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Just amazing,&#8221; Benjamin said of his teammate. &#8220;So proud of him.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Upon his finish, Dos Santos gave two bows to the cheering crowd. He broke Kevin Young&#8217;s world-championship record of 47.18 seconds set in 1993 in Germany. Dos Santos won bronze at the Tokyo Games last summer behind Warholm and Benjamin.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The energy of the crowd was amazing,&#8221; Dos Santos said. &#8220;I felt their love, people hugging me. When you win, you start being everyone&#8217;s favorite.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, it was a night full of surprises, with Jake Wightman of Britain winning the 1,500 meters. He had a look of disbelief as he crossed the finish line ahead of Olympic champion and heavy favorite Jakob Ingebrigtsen of Norway.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Crazy,&#8221; Wightman said.<\/p>\n<p>The in-stadium announcer for Wightman&#8217;s race was none other than his dad, Geoff. Handing Jake Wightman the gold medal after the race was none other than British middle-distance great Sebastian Coe, who also happens to be the World Athletics President and one of Wightman&#8217;s mentors.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;What else could I ask for?&#8221; Wightman said.<\/p>\n<p>Wightman&#8217;s win arrived because he decided to take a chance and go all-out with about 200 meters to go.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I thought, &#8216;I&#8217;m going to give this a go,'&#8221; Wightman said. &#8220;&#8216;If I end up finishing fourth, whatever. I gave it a go to try to win.&#8221;&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>Maybe the biggest shocker of the night was that Wightman&#8217;s dad was able to keep it together on the call in the stadium, even with his own son about to win.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I have to keep it neutral,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;So there&#8217;s things you can do just to stop yourself from getting emotional.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Wightman finished in a time of 3 minutes, 29.23 seconds. His win broke a string of five straight world 1,500 titles by the Kenyans. Spain&#8217;s Mohamed Katir flew down the homestretch to take home bronze.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;To take the win, I think it will take a long time to sink in,&#8221; Wightman said. &#8220;I just wanted to show I was in good shape and to build on it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Jamaican women are poised for another sprint sweep after qualifying three for the final in the 200. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, Shericka Jackson and Elaine Thompson-Herah &#8212; the finishing order of the 100 &#8212; all advanced. Jackson had the fastest time at 21.67.<\/p>\n<p>It was an easy night at the track for the medal favorites in the women&#8217;s 400 hurdles. Olympic champion and world-record holder Sydney McLaughlin, defending world champion Dalilah Muhammad and Olympic bronze medalist Femke Bol of the Netherlands easily won their first-round heats.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This event has become one of the main focuses for the last couple of years,&#8221; Muhammad said. &#8220;It could be any one of our days. So we&#8217;ll just see how it goes.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Other winners included Australia&#8217;s Eleanor Patterson in the women&#8217;s high jump and Kristjan Ceh of Slovenia in the men&#8217;s discus.<\/p>\n<p><em>The Associated Press contributed to this report. <\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>EUGENE, Ore. &#8212; World 100-meter champ Fred Kerley will not have a chance at two individual medals at the world championships after he slowed down midway through his 200-meter semifinal due to a cramp and finished sixth.The American, once a 400-meter specialist who moved down in distance before last year&#8217;s Olympics, was holding his left&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":4605,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[13],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4604"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4604"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4604\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":7183,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4604\/revisions\/7183"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4604"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4604"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4604"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
