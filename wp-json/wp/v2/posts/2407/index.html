So it&#8217;s not surprising that three league MVPs in their mid-to-late 20s with that skill set lead the way in ESPN&#8217;s 2022 preseason ranking of the top 25 players in the WNBA.<\/p>\n<p>But longevity is also a defining characteristic in the WNBA, and some of the league&#8217;s most respected veterans are still hanging tough among the elite.<\/p>\n<p>As the WNBA gets set to start its 26th season on May 6, our ranking comes with a couple of caveats. Phoenix Mercury center Brittney Griner (detained in Russia) and Minnesota Lynx forward Napheesa Collier (pregnancy) are two players who would have made the list but won&#8217;t be in action to start the season, so they are left off. Also, we will re-rank players throughout the season, so players who show they have elevated their games or &#8212; like Washington Mystics forward Alysha Clark &#8212; are coming back from injuries, might make it into the top 25.<\/p>\n<p>In a 12-team league, a player already has to be among the best of the best just to get a roster spot. But here are the very best.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/headshots\/wnba\/players\/full\/2998928.png?w=65&amp;h=90&amp;scale=crop&amp;background=0xcccccc&amp;transparent=true\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Forward | 6-foot-4<br \/>2021 stats: 20.3 PPG, 9.6 RPG<\/p>\n<p>After reestablishing herself as the best player in the world with a dominant performance in the 2020 WNBA Finals, averaging 28.3 PPG as the Storm swept the Aces for a second title in three years, Stewart was a strong contender for MVP before injury ended her 2021 campaign late in the regular season. Back healthy after offseason Achilles surgery, Stewart will be looking to pick up where she left off in the playoffs. Seattle has won the last 10 postseason games Stewart has played, as well as last year&#8217;s inaugural Commissioner&#8217;s Cup &#8212; where Stewart won another MVP. &#8212; <em>Pelton<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/g.espncdn.com\/lm-static\/wfba\/images\/promo-cards\/wfba-1320x528_01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Experience the 2022 WNBA season like never before with the first full-featured fantasy league game dedicated to a professional women&#8217;s sport.

It&#8217;s not just Jones&#8217; consistent dominance that stands out, but her versatility (she&#8217;s a 6-foot-6 forward\/center who shoots 3s!) and ability to impact both ends of the floor make her a headache for opposing teams. Still, Jones isn&#8217;t one to rest on her laurels, especially after the Sun&#8217;s championship goals were foiled by red-hot Chicago in the semifinals; she will be back, now reunited with former teammate Courtney Williams, hungrier than ever to lead the Sun to a franchise-first title. &#8212; <em>Philippou<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/headshots\/wnba\/players\/full\/3149391.png?w=65&amp;h=90&amp;scale=crop&amp;background=0xcccccc&amp;transparent=true\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Forward | 6-foot-4<br \/>2021 stats: 18.3 PPG, 9.3 RPG, 1.3 BPG<\/p>\n<p>Wilson has a WNBA MVP award, an Olympic gold medal and a statue of herself at her alma mater, South Carolina, but is still just 25 years old.

She was crushed by the Aces&#8217; semifinal loss to Phoenix last season; Wilson wants so badly to win a title for a franchise that has not done so in any of its three incarnations in Utah, San Antonio and Las Vegas.

Her 64% shooting in 2021 was the second-best of her career, and she was No. 4 in the league in win shares (6.3), according to Her Hoops Stats. The Lynx might face more questions than certainties heading into the summer, but look for Minnesota to do all it can to send Fowles out with a bang. &#8212; <em>Philippou<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/headshots\/wnba\/players\/full\/2491205.png?w=65&amp;h=90&amp;scale=crop&amp;background=0xcccccc&amp;transparent=true\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Guard | 5-foot-9<br \/>2021 stats: 17.7 PPG, 3.2 RPG, 5.3 APG<\/p>\n<p>The move to play for Phoenix in 2020 has been very good for Diggins-Smith, who helped the Mercury make the WNBA Finals last year and also won gold with the U.S. Olympic team.

She opted out of the 2020 season due to health concerns, before the Mystics were hit with a slew of injuries to Elena Delle Donne, Alysha Clark and others in 2021, resulting in them missing the postseason. Now, she&#8217;ll start fresh in Phoenix, her third team in four seasons, as she chases the last honor she has yet to secure across her decorated collegiate and pro career: a WNBA title. The Phoenix frontcourt will look different than expected with Griner still detained in Russia, but Charles will be surrounded by a plethora of stars who figure to make the Mercury championship contenders once more. &#8212; <em>Philippou<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/headshots\/wnba\/players\/full\/812.png?w=65&amp;h=90&amp;scale=crop&amp;background=0xcccccc&amp;transparent=true\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Forward\/center | 6-foot-4<br \/>2021 stats: 13.3 PPG, 8.4 RPG, 4.0 APG<\/p>\n<p>This past year has been magical for Parker.

An offseason that she has painted as restorative and transformative, though, has left Delle Donne feeling the best she has in years and the basketball world eager for her to retake the floor. There&#8217;s little doubt that if\/when healthy, she remains one of the best players in the world. &#8212; <em>Philippou<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/headshots\/wnba\/players\/full\/869.png?w=65&amp;h=90&amp;scale=crop&amp;background=0xcccccc&amp;transparent=true\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Forward\/guard | 6-foot-4<br \/>2021 stats: 15.2 PPG, 6.4 RPG<\/p>\n<p>Like some others on this list, Bonner has more seasons in the league behind her rather than in front of her, but since joining the Sun in 2020, she has managed to be a stabilizing force as the team navigated unexpected absences of key pieces in back-to-back seasons. Last year, that entailed her being the second scoring option behind Jonquel Jones, but Bonner also did a little bit of everything else, coming in third on the team in rebounding, second in assists and at times being a really disruptive defender. There should be less weight on her shoulders with a healthy Alyssa Thomas and Courtney Williams incorporated into the fold in 2022, but Bonner will nonetheless play a big part in determining how far the Sun go this summer. &#8212; <em>Philippou<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/headshots\/wnba\/players\/full\/1068.png?w=65&amp;h=90&amp;scale=crop&amp;background=0xcccccc&amp;transparent=true\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Forward | 6-foot-2<br \/>2021 stats: 14.5 PPG, 6.5 RPG, 2.7 APG<\/p>\n<p>It was a challenging 2021 for Ogwumike, who dealt with a knee injury that limited her to 18 games, an enormous disappointment being left off the Olympic team despite her extensive USA Basketball history, and the Sparks&#8217; failure to make the playoffs. That came on the heels of a demanding 2020 season in the bubble, during which her role as president of the union&#8217;s executive committee was a full-time job on top of playing.

That Thomas made it back at all to play in 2021 is a testament to her work ethic. She played in two regular-season games and four playoff games for the Sun, who lost in the semifinals to Chicago. Her 15.5 PPG, 9.0 RPG and 4.8 APG averages in 2020 more accurately show Thomas&#8217; ability, and coach Curt Miller also considers her one of the league&#8217;s best defensive players.

At age 41, Bird remains an indispensable player. With former backup Jordin Canada slumping, Bird averaged her most MPG (27.7) since 2017 and did not miss a game due to injury. (She sat out two after the Olympics to rest.)
