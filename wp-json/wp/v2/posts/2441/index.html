Lisa will hate those,\u2019 \u201d says the actress, on the phone from LA the day after our Alexa shoot. \u201cI was like, \u2018What boots?\u2019 They brought them out and I was like, \u2018Are you kidding me? Those are the coolest things ever, they make the outfit!\u2019 \u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s all part of her approach to both life and work, which is that \u201cI say yes more than I say no,\u201d the actress and \u201cReal Housewives of Beverly Hills\u201d star says. \u201cRight now, in my life, I\u2019m really very free. I\u2019m not self-conscious, I\u2019ll do anything. And that makes it easy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At 58, she\u2019s kind of a TV Tabasco. If you want to spice up a show, just add Rinna. In the soaps heyday of the early \u201990s, she joined \u201cDays of Our Lives\u201d as the new love interest of fan favorite Bo Brady (Peter Reckell). She moved on to the Aaron Spelling nighttime soap \u201cMelrose Place,\u201d and had a guest spot on Kristen Bell\u2019s early aughts teen noir \u201cVeronica Mars.\u201d She competed on \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d and hosted the SoapNet show \u201cSoap Talk,\u201d not to mention writing three books and releasing a fitness tape and QVC fashion line, before finding a place on one of the defining reality shows of the last 15 years.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/lisa-rina-john-russo-sequin-dress.jpg?w=682\" alt=\"Lisa Rinna styled by Ashley Pruitt.\" \/><b>Tom Ford dress<\/b>, $4,980 at Bloom\u2019s Room, Neiman Marcus Beverly Hills, 310-691-0894; <b>18-k pink-gold earrings with diamonds<\/b>, $8,442 at <b>Djula<\/b>; <b>\u201cNotice Me\u201d Lip Liner<\/b> and <b>\u201cLife\u2019s a Peach\u201d Larger Than Life Lip Plumping Gloss<\/b>John Russo    <\/p>\n<p>Her knack for stirring up trouble is widely credited as a key reinvigoration of Andy Cohen\u2019s franchise. Because Rinna, more than most, understands how to court drama. And she serves it up weekly on \u201cHousewives,\u201d with a twinkle. \u201cThe person that\u2019s on the show is a version of me for when people are, like, throwing s\u2013t at me,\u201d she says. \u201cI do things on the show that I would never do in real life.

My real life is very lovely and calm.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Lisa Rinna<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Rinna will be the first to tell you she wasn\u2019t always this secure in her career. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I got to this point, all I know is it\u2019s really nice,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t care if I look silly, and it\u2019s super freeing. There were a lot of hurdles. I definitely didn\u2019t have this way back then. It\u2019s been over the last 10 or 15 years.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>One hurdle, since transformed into a central part of the Rinna brand, was scrutiny over her now-iconic big lips. As she revealed on \u201cToday\u201d in 2009, she got silicone injected into her upper lip when she was in her early 20s, on the front edge of the trend; gradually, those injections hardened into scar tissue, leading her to reduction and recontouring surgery.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/lisa-rinna-john-russo-boots.jpg?w=682\" alt=\"Lisa Rinna\" \/>\u201cAntonio Lopez\u201d dress, $1,850, and boots, $4,900 (similar styles), both at Fendi; Ring, Rinna\u2019s own (worn throughout); \u201cNotice Me\u201d Lip Liner and \u201cLife\u2019s a Peach\u201d Larger Than Life Lip Plumping Gloss, both at Rinna Beauty.    <\/p>\n<p>Her over-the-top pout (even downsized) became one of Rinna\u2019s trademark looks, along with her shag haircut. So naturally her makeup line, Rinna Beauty, kicked off with a series of lip kits and a plumper. \u201cI mean, you see my name, you kinda know what you\u2019re going to get,\u201d she quips. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about having big lips \u2014 it\u2019s about having big, healthy, moist lips.\u201d She\u2019s quick to point out that her plumper doesn\u2019t use the chili pepper-derived ingredient, capsaicin, that most plumping products do. \u201cWe use something that has mint in it. It\u2019s an enjoyable experience, as opposed to, \u2018Oh my god, my lips are really irritated,\u2019\u201d she explains.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just about having big lips \u2014 it\u2019s about having big, healthy, moist lips.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Lisa Rinna<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\u201cI really wanted to do this 15 years ago, but I couldn\u2019t make a deal with anybody,\u201d she says of Rinna Beauty, which launched in November 2020 after she eventually found the right company to partner with. \u201cAnd then COVID hit, and we launched a lip kit right when everyone was wearing masks!\u201d she says. \u201cBut it took off like bonkers, so now I feel like it\u2019s meant to be.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Rinna walks the walk, wearing her brand at every opportunity. \u201cI\u2019m wearing the \u2018Notice Me\u2019 lip liner, which everybody loves,\u201d she says. \u201cYou cover the whole lip with it. And then I\u2019m wearing the \u2018Mrs. Hamlin\u2019 lipstick on top.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/lisa-rinna-john-russo-suit.jpg?w=682\" alt=\"\" \/>Crystal bandeau, $1,890, tuxedo jacket $3,490, and pants, $1,990, all at Michael Kors; Diamond earrings, $30,400 at Djula; \u201cNotice Me\u201d Lip Liner, \u201cEnvy Me\u201d Lipstick and \u201cJet Setter\u201d Lip Plumping Gloss, all at Rinna Beauty.John Russo    <\/p>\n<p>That \u201cMrs. Hamlin\u201d shade, a pinky blush, seems an in-joke for Rinna and her husband, actor Harry Hamlin, whom she married in 1997 and with whom she has two daughters, Amelia Gray Hamlin and Delilah Belle Hamlin. (Along with a still-spicy marriage.) <\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what? Harry does not like a red lip,\u201d Rinna says with a laugh. \u201cHe thinks women become bitchy when they wear red lipstick. I think his mom wore a red lip. So I\u2019m like, \u2018OK, fine, whatever you need, sweetie.\u2019 I never wear a red lip when I\u2019m around him.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But that resolution was tested when she and Hamlin co-starred in \u201cChicago\u201d on Broadway in 2007. \u201cRoxie Hart wears a red lip!\u201d she says. \u201cSo I was like, \u2018Honey, you\u2019re going to have to get over it for the next three months.\u2019 It was fine, but we always laugh about that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/alexa-lisa-rinna-below.jpg?w=683\" alt=\"Lisa Rinna, styled by Ashley Pruitt.\" \/>Valentino dress, $10,900, at Bloom\u2019s Room, Neiman Marcus Beverly Hills; 18-k honey-gold earrings with diamonds, $90,095, similar styles at Le Vian; Pink morganite ring, $18,995, similar styles at Kallati; \u201cNotice Me\u201d Lip Liner, \u201cEnvy Me\u201d Lipstick and \u201cJet Setter\u201d Lip Plumping Gloss, all at Rinna Beauty.John Russo    <\/p>\n<p>Hamlin, Rinna says, doesn\u2019t have an Instagram account. \u201cHe\u2019s completely living his life in a free way, and it\u2019s pretty wonderful to watch.\u201d But he\u2019s always game to appear on Rinna\u2019s feed. A reel earlier this month shows her dancing on their deck while he trims the foliage, both clad in floppy sun hats. \u201cHe reminds us all the time that whatever other people think of you is none of your business.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And what other people think of Rinna is \u2026 a lot. Since joining \u201cRHOBH\u201d in its fifth season in 2014, she\u2019s polarized audiences with her instinct for digging into social sore spots (a compilation called \u201cLisa Rinna\u2019s Messiest Moments\u201d from the show has 1.6 million views on YouTube).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI just try not to pay attention to [comments], really. I mean, I\u2019m human, so of course it\u2019s going to get me from time to time. But I think at this point I\u2019ve probably acquired elephant skin,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to get to a point where you\u2019re like, listen, what I do is for entertainment.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Rinna, a longtime gay rights supporter and fan of \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race,\u201d has recently embraced wigs as a way to lean into the playing-a-character aspect of her persona, both on \u201cRHOBH\u201d and the red carpet; she wore a dramatic, long mane to last month\u2019s GLAAD awards. \u201cWhat the wigs do is give me that characterization of being somebody a little different than myself,\u201d she reflects. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s like drag. I understand drag much better now than I ever have. You can express yourself differently, get out of your comfort zone.\u201d She even names her wigs, and several Rinna Beauty lip kits after them.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/alexa-lisa-rinna-bottom.jpg?w=683\" alt=\"Lisa Rinna, styled by Ashley Pruitt.\" \/>Dundas \u201cEllis\u201d dress, $2,990 at Bloom\u2019s Room, Neiman Marcus Beverly Hills; Gianvito Rossi sandals, Rinna\u2019s own;  14-k honey-gold ring, $5,595, and 18-k honey-gold earrings with diamonds, $90,095, similar styles at Le Vian; \u201cHeidi\u201d Lip Kit at Rinna Beauty.John Russo    <\/p>\n<p>But the newest season of \u201cRHOBH,\u201d which premieres May 11, wasn\u2019t all cheeky fun for Rinna. Her mother, Lois, died in November, a loss she\u2019s still working through. \u201cI\u2019m trying to just allow myself to feel whatever I feel,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just sadness. Grief is a long process. And you\u2019re going to see it play out on the show.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Around the same time, she came down with COVID. \u201cIt was bad \u2014 I lost my taste and smell. But it really did allow me to sit and grieve in that moment.\u201d That is, when she wasn\u2019t on video calls for the show. \u201cThey FaceTimed a lot while I had COVID. So I think you\u2019ll be seeing that. It\u2019s not always cute.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Even through the hardships of the past year, she feels grateful to be at the top of her career game at an age when too many women are cast aside by the industry. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think I\u2019m an outlier,\u201d she says with her typical candor. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is happening for a lot of women. I wish it were more. Not many people I started out with are still in the business.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/lisa-rinna-john-russo-barefoot.jpg?w=683\" \/>\u201cFinley\u201d dress, $695 at Jonathan Simkhai John Russo    <\/p>\n<p>She attributes her staying power to her superhuman work ethic, and \u201cmy huge narcissistic desire to have the world approve of me, probably,\u201d but also says her 50s are much better than she\u2019d ever expected. \u201cYou really don\u2019t give a s\u2013t anymore. If you\u2019re healthy and take care of yourself, you feel great, because you\u2019re smarter than you\u2019ve ever been. I love my 50s. I think it\u2019s the greatest era.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Like her idols, Jane Fonda and Cher and Dolly Parton, Rinna plans to keep powering on for decades. \u201cMy husband\u2019s working with Jane Fonda right now, and she said to him, \u2018Harry, I\u2019m 85 years old and I\u2019m doing more movies than I\u2019ve ever done in my career.\u2019 I mean, if that doesn\u2019t give you hope to keep going, and not sell yourself short, I don\u2019t know what does!\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>Editor: Serena French; Stylist: Ashley Pruitt at The Only Agency; Fashion Assistant: Laura Camargo; Photo Editor: Jessica Hober; Hair: Bryan Fisher at A-Frame Agency; Makeup: Steven Tabimba; Location: 1 Hotel West Hollywood; 8490 Sunset Blvd. <\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>New York Post may be compensated and\/or receive an affiliate commission if you buy through our links.
