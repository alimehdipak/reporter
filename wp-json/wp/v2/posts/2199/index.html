In doing so, the 52-year-old became the fifth permanent manager appointed by the club since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.<\/p>\n<p>With interim coach Ralf Rangnick at the helm, United&#8217;s hopes of finishing in the Premier League&#8217;s top four were dealt a hammer blow by a 3-1 loss to Arsenal on Sunday, leaving them six points behind the fourth-placed Gunners having played a game more.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think [Ten Hag has] got a very difficult job,&#8221; Yorke told ESPN. &#8220;Simply because it has been a bit of a disaster for us as a football club in terms of personnel and where the team is at. There&#8217;s no hiding place in that. We&#8217;re not where we&#8217;re supposed to be. But there&#8217;s a new beginning, a new start for a manager who a lot of people don&#8217;t particularly know. Obviously, he has done well in Holland. [But] the Premier League is a whole new ball game. Manchester United&#8217;s manager is on a whole different level.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Sources have told ESPN that the Dutchman has been informed by the club&#8217;s brass that he will be overseeing an evolution rather than revolution when he takes over. This follows Rangnick floating the possibility that as many as 10 players could arrive in the summer.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I keep saying that he has to embrace going in there and have full control,&#8221; Yorke said. &#8220;If he has full control he can implement his style, his way, and the players that he wants on board to make sure he can get the best out of them. I think that is the key.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>12.51 BST: Manchester City winger Riyad Mahrez is a target for Inter Milan, says Tuttosport.<\/p>\n<p>Mahrez, 31, has a contract that expires in 2023 and has yet to agree new terms despite scoring 23 goals and assisting nine times in 43 games this season.<\/p>\n<p>The Algeria international has been tracked by Paris Saint-Germain, but Inter are looking to make him their top target for a fee of around \u20ac40m.<\/p>\n<p>12.08 BST: Liverpool are looking to sign Braga defender David Carmo if he leaves the club this summer, says O Jogo.<\/p>\n<p>Carmo, 22, was linked with a move to Anfield back in 2021 &#8212; with a \u20ac4m loan deal, and option to sign permanently for \u20ac20m rejected &#8212; and Jurgen Klopp is reportedly a big fan of the 6-foot-5 centre-back.<\/p>\n<p>Braga would require the player&#8217;s \u20ac40m release clause to be paid, but it seems like Liverpool are still keen.<\/p>\n<p>11.35 BST: Sergio Ramos has said he wants to prove to Paris Saint-Germain, after an injury-hit first season with the French champions, that he can live up to the expectations the club had of him when they signed him last summer.<\/p>\n<p>Ramos, 36, has only made 10 appearances across all competitions since joining PSG on a two-year contract.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve spent few hours on the pitch this season in the PSG jersey,&#8221; Ramos said in a video posted by PSG. &#8220;I&#8217;m at the prime of my career and eager to show my new team, Paris Saint-Germain, how much football I have inside me.

However, Phillips is massive Leeds fans and the rivalry with United is deep, so he may not consider a move to Old Trafford for that reason.<\/p>\n<p>09.27 BST: The Daily Telegraph reports that Donny van de Beek is set to get a fresh start under Erik ten Hag at Man United.<\/p>\n<p>Van de Beek, 25, has been on loan at Everton this season after struggling since a \u20ac40m move from Ajax in 2020.<\/p>\n<p>Ajax boss Ten Hag is eager to work with his former midfielder again when he moves to Old Trafford in the summer and will give him a chance to prove himself.<\/p>\n<p>08.30 BST: Barcelona defender Ronald Araujo has agreed a new contract until 2026 with his release clause rising to \u20ac1bn, the club announced on Tuesday.<\/p>\n<p>Araujo&#8217;s previous deal was due to expire in 2023 and ESPN revealed last month that both Manchester United and Liverpool were keen on signing the Uruguay international.<\/p>\n<p>The money on the table from the Premier League sides was higher than Barca&#8217;s offer, but sources have told ESPN that the player&#8217;s priority was always to remain at Camp Nou.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/soccer\/blog-transfer-talk\/story\/4651902\/\" \/>play<\/p>\n<p>1:42<\/p>\n<p>Julien Laurens doesn&#8217;t believe Thomas Tuchel&#8217;s comments that financial sanctions placed on Chelsea prevented them from keeping Antonio Rudiger.<\/p>\n<h2>PAPER GOSSIP (by Adam Brown)<\/h2>\n<p>&#8211; Jules Kounde wants to leave Sevilla at the end of the season, according to Ekrem Konur. The LaLiga club will be looking for a fee in the region of \u20ac70m if they are to part ways with the 23-year-old defender, with a move to Chelsea having been repeatedly linked.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Arsenal have begun talks with the representatives of Manchester City&#8217;s Gabriel Jesus, reports Goal.
