It requires special, regular care to get a healthy smile. Oral issues are quick to occur even with the slightest neglect. Therefore, it is necessary that you brush and floss your teeth. However, just brushing and flossing your teeth is not enough; there is more that you can do to keep them healthy and clean.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Keep Your Teeth Healthy &amp; Clean<\/h2>\n<p>Oral care is important for a healthy smile. You can keep your teeth clean and strong by sticking to the following:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Follow the Proper Brushing Technique and Habits<\/h3>\n<p>Generally, dentists recommend brushing your teeth twice a day. The reason is that brushing your teeth at night eliminates the bacteria and plaque in your mouth. Therefore, your teeth remain clean throughout the night, and you are safe from tooth decay. Moreover, use fluoride toothpaste to brush your teeth. Fluoride remarkably prevents your teeth from tooth decay and acts as a protective barrier.<\/p>\n<p>Other than this, avoid spitting after brushing your teeth; let the toothpaste stay for 10-30 minutes. Why? Because it will help strengthen your teeth, as fluoride works its magic. Rinsing your mouth immediately after brushing will dilute the fluoride, decreasing its effectiveness.<\/p>\n<p>Another thing to know is how to brush your teeth. Take at least two minutes to brush your teeth. Use a gentle approach while brushing, slowly drawing circles and covering every surface. Furthermore, use a toothbrush with soft bristles. Also, don\u2019t forget to brush your tongue if you don\u2019t have a tongue cleaner.<\/p>\n<p>These brushing techniques and habits will help you maintain the cleanliness of your teeth, making them healthy and strong. Remember to always change your toothbrush every 3 to 4 months.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Don\u2019t Neglect Flossing<\/h3>\n<p>Many people don\u2019t consider flossing an important part of their oral hygiene. Even if they do, they end up neglecting it. Flossing is essential for improving your oral health. In fact, it is as important as brushing. At least once a day, floss your teeth by following a proper technique. It helps eliminate plaque and debris between your teeth and gumlines that a toothbrush cannot reach. Moreover, it helps prevent bad breath and gum disease. It is crucial that you follow the proper flossing technique, which is:<br \/>\nTake a 30cm to 45cm of floss string.<br \/>\nUse your hands\u2019 index fingers and thumbs to hold the interdental cleaner from each side, leaving 3cm to 4cm between your hands.<br \/>\nSlide the floss between two of your teeth slowly. Wiggle it slowly, so it reaches your gum line.<br \/>\nCup the floss in a way it hugs each tooth and slides over it. Repeat this step to clean the gum line and each tooth.<br \/>\nWiggle it up and down between each tooth to dislodge debris and plaque.<\/p>\n<p>Flossing can be difficult; it might even cause minor bleeding if you are new at it. However, it is no reason to give it up. If floss does not work for you, you can use other interdental cleaners like water floss, interdental brushes, or floss picks.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Use A Mouthwash<\/h3>\n<p>Mouthwash helps freshen your breath, reduces acid, and cleans every corner of your mouth. Rinse your mouth with mouthwash between meals to clean it and reduce bacteria. Avoid eating and drinking for at least 30 minutes after using a mouthwash.<br \/>\nAn antibacterial mouthwash may be the best choice, as it masks bad breath and kills the bacteria. Ask your <a href=\"http:\/\/precisionsmiledentistry.blogspot.com\/2018\/08\/smile-it-out-with-stafford-va-dentist.html\">dentist<\/a> for suggestions on a good mouthwash to keep your teeth healthy and clean.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Get Regular Professional Cleanings From Your Dentist<\/h3>\n<p>Visiting your dentist at least twice a year is vital for oral health. They can detect any possible issues and treat them accordingly. Moreover, you can get professional cleanings done too. No matter how properly you brush or floss your teeth, there are some areas that only your <a href=\"https:\/\/precisionsmile.blogspot.com\/2021\/10\/a-lost-tooth-can-be-replaced-by-dental.html\">dentist<\/a> can clean. They will remove any calculus and cavities present in your tooth. Regular professional cleanings help keep your teeth shiny, healthy, and clean for a long time.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Cut Down on Sugary &amp; Acidic Foods<\/h3>\n<p>Sugary and acidic food can negatively affect oral health, damaging teeth. Therefore, limiting beverages like coffee, tea, sodas, red wine, and alcohol can help improve your teeth\u2019s health. Candies and other sugary and acidic food can also lead to cavities. Moreover, beverages like coffee and red wine can also stain your teeth. Consequently, your teeth lose whiteness and get a stained, yellow exterior. Thus, reducing your sugar and acid intake can help keep your teeth clean.<\/p>\n<h2>What\u2019s the Takeaway?<\/h2>\n<p>Clean teeth are the key to a healthy, beautiful smile. To keep your teeth clean, it is essential to brush and floss them regularly. Using a mouthwash can help keep them healthy as well. Moreover, regular dental cleanings can keep them shining and clean for a while. Limiting sugary and acidic foods and drinks can help improve your smile.
