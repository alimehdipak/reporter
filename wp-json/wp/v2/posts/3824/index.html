He slicked back his hair and sang Carole King\u2019s \u201cI Feel the Earth Move.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHis audition was completely unfocused,\u201d recalls Tom Moore, who directed the original Broadway production. \u201cIt was all over the place. But he had a terrific voice. He was immensely charming. And he was very attractive. He looked like a French movie star.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>His name was John Travolta.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Moore cast him in the show, but not as Danny. \u201cHe was too young for the part,\u201d Moore says. \u201cSo we made him Doody, a goofy character who got kind of thrown away in the movie.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Travolta toured with the show for two years. \u201cI got to observe three to five Zuckos and got to see exactly what worked and what didn\u2019t,\u201d he recalls in \u201cGREASE: Tell Me More, Tell Me More: Stories from the Broadway Phenomenon That Started It All\u201d (Chicago Review Press), a new oral history of the show. What worked was his performance in the movie, which to date has grossed $400 million. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"816\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/tell-me-more.jpg?w=816\" \/>The original Broadway cast: Jerry Zaks, Vivian Fineman, Michael Lembeck, Ray DeMattis, Marilu Henner and John Travolta in \u201cGrease.\u201d    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cGrease\u201d opened in New York 50 years ago this year. The book is edited by Moore, \u201cMaude\u201d star Adrienne Barbeau \u2014 who played the first Rizzo on Broadway \u2014\u00a0and Ken Waissman, who raised $110,000 to produce the musical on the Lower East Side before moving it to Broadway, where it ran eight years. <\/p>\n<p>The inspiration for the musical struck one night in 1969, when Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey, two aspiring theater writers living in Chicago, went on a nostalgia trip. Drunk and stoned, they\u2019d been listening to Led Zeppelin, but then decided to put on a record by Dion and the Belmonts. It took them back to their high school days in the 1950s. Jacobs wondered why no one had ever written a musical with a \u201950s style rock \u2018n\u2019 roll score.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFun idea,\u201d Casey said, \u201cbut what the hell would it be about?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/grease-broadway.jpg?w=1024\" \/>Ilene Kristen (Patty), Barry Bostwick (Zucko) and Adrienne Barbeau (Rizzo) were characters meant to remind theatergoers of their own high school classmates.     <\/p>\n<p>Jacobs thought for a moment and replied: \u201cMaybe it should be about the people I went to high school with.\u201d A moment later he had the title. Since everything was greasy in those days \u2014 food, hair, guys working under the hood of a Ford De Luxe \u2014 Jacobs said, \u201cIt could be called \u2018Grease.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Jacobs and Casey didn\u2019t know it at the time, but their nostalgia trip would one day become one of the longest-running shows in Broadway history as well as the 1978 movie that had the world doing the hand jive \u2014 and made stars of John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John. <\/p>\n<p>Other cast who appeared in various productions of \u201cGrease\u201d include actors such as Marilu Henner (before her role in \u201cTaxi\u201d), who played Marty, Richard Gere as Sonny and Barry Bostwick (later of \u201cRocky Horror Picture Show\u201d fame).<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/grease-marquee-eden.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"The Eden marquee\" \/>The Eden marquee: \u201950s nostalgia in the 1970s.     <\/p>\n<p>Waissman first heard about \u201cGrease\u201d from his college roommate, an orthodontist living in Chicago. Jacobs and Casey had scraped the show together and, with a cast of amateurs (including one Henner), put it on in the basement of an old trolley barn. The dentist, \u201cwho never had a good word to say about anything,\u201d Waissman tells the Post, \u201ccalled me and said, \u2018I think I\u2019ve found a show for you.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Waissman flew to Chicago, sat on newspapers (there were no seats in the trolley barn) and watched teenagers from Rydell High sing \u201cBeauty School Drop Out,\u201d \u201cWe Go Together,\u201d and \u201cGreased Lightnin\u2019.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I saw was my high school yearbook coming to life,\u201d Waissman says. \u201cThe show was barely the show it became \u2013 it was just some scenes and some good songs \u2014 but the characters were authentic. You knew Danny. You knew Sandy. You\u2019d gone to school with them.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/liz-taylor-richard-burton.jpg?w=1024\" \/>Liz Taylor and Richard Burton \u2014 who was starring in \u201cEquus\u201d down the block \u2014 were big early fans of \u201cGrease\u201d and took the cast to dinner at Sardi\u2019s. Bob Penn\/Sygma\/Sygma via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>Waissman believed that, for the show to work in New York, it had to retain its authenticity and ragged edge. The actors would have to look like they really were in high school. An agent urged him to hire Michael Bennett, just a few years away from creating \u201cA Chorus Line,\u201d to stage the show, but he balked. Bennett\u2019s work was slick and depended on trained dancers. It would be too polished for \u201cGrease.\u201d He went instead with choreographer Patricia Birch, who had a reputation for teaching non-dancing actors how to dance.<\/p>\n<p>For his director, he turned to Tom Moore, a recent Yale graduate who had one New York credit to his name: \u201cWelcome to Andromeda,\u201d a two-character play about a quadriplegic who wants to kill himself and a nurse who urges him to go on living. Waissman had seen the play and was struck by how real the characters were. Moore, he thought, would bring the kind of authenticity to the acting that Birch would bring to the dancing.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"937\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/grease-tell-me-more-book-07.JPEG.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Richard Gere, \u201cAll Choked Up.\u201d\" \/>Richard Gere performs \u201cAll Choked Up\u201d on stage.     <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI had done a play in which only ONE person moved,\u201d Moore told The Post, \u201cso I wasn\u2019t sure musicals were in my future.\u201d He read the script, which \u201chad severe problems,\u201d and listened to the \u201cimpressive\u201d score. But he turned down the job. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something I wanted to,\u201d he says. Then he flipped through the script again and caught what Waissman had seen in Chicago: His high school yearbook coming to life.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI went to high school in Indiana and there were about three Greasers there,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThey were soft-core \u2014 they drank, they smoked, they cut class. I wasn\u2019t part of their group at all, but I remembered them and there they were in \u2018Grease.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In the original draft of \u201cGrease,\u201d the characters were rough-edged. Some were downright unlikeable. Working with Jacobs and Casey, Moore kept them rough, but gave them humanity.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"791\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/grease-tell-me-more-book-04.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\u201cGreased Lightnin\u2019\u201d\" \/>\u201cThe show is about everybody\u2019s first experience,\u201d says Moore. \u201cYour first time in a new school; the first time you become part of a group; your first kiss; your first love.\u201d\u00a0    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere are two reasons why \u2018Grease\u2019 has been so successful,\u201d Moore says. \u201cNumber one: the characters are prototypes for everybody you knew in high school. But they have heart and vulnerability. I think I helped with that. And number two, and this is what Jim and Warren understood, the show is about everybody\u2019s first experience: Your first time in a new school; the first time you become part of a group; your first kiss; your first love.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Moore and Birch assembled a cast of young and unknown actors, including Alan Paul, who thought he was auditioning for a musical about \u201cGreece, the country,\u201d he says in the book.<\/p>\n<p>Rehearsals were \u201cdelightful,\u201d Moore recalls. And then came the first preview at the Eden Theater on Second Avenue. \u201cRocky does not begin to describe it,\u201d Moore says. \u201cIt was a disaster. It shook us to our core.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/grease-tell-me-more-book-11.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Jerry Zaks, Ray DeMattis, Barry Bostwick, Judy Kaye, and John Travolta in the first national tour company.\" \/>The first national tour company: Jerry Zaks, Ray DeMattis, Barry Bostwick, Judy Kaye, and John Travolta.    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted to commit suicide,\u201d says Waissman. \u201cThere was gloom and doom all over the place. But I said to Tom, \u2018How do you clean up a room? You start by picking up the first sock.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>They began picking up the socks and within three weeks, they had transformed the show from a disaster into something that, they felt, audiences were enjoying. The movie version of \u201cGrease\u201d would usher in a wave of nostalgia for the 1950s, but the ripples began down at the Eden Theater.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the critic for the New York Times was British \u2014 Clive Barnes, who was immune to \u201850s Americana.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"689\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/grease-movie.jpg?w=689\" alt=\"Dinah Manoff, Barry Pearl, Kelly Ward, John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John, Stockard Channing, Jeff Conaway, Didi Conn, Michael Tucci, in 1978.\" \/>The 1978 film firmly established \u201cGrease\u201d as a pop-culture legend. Paramount    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey are starting to be nostalgic about 1959 now, and almost all I can remember about it is that it was a great year for Burgundy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe show is a thin joke \u2026 and once the initial joke has been established, it is bound to wear thin.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Everybody told Waissman to close the show. His lawyer told him he was $20,000 in debt. But Waissman held on. He couldn\u2019t pay the $20,000 in any case, so he thought he might as well keep the show open and see what happens. Within three weeks, \u201cGrease\u201d was a hit. Word of mouth trumped the critics. Audiences were flocking to the Eden to relive their high school years.<\/p>\n<p>Waissman moved the show to Broadway, where it immediately sold out. Among its many fans were Richard Burton, starring in \u201cEquus\u201d on the same block, and his ex-wife Elizabeth Taylor. Burton and Taylor took the cast to dinner at Sardi\u2019s. Everybody jockeyed for a chance to sit next to Taylor, who polished off a fair amount of Johnny Walker.<\/p>\n<p>Neither Waissman nor Moore had much to do with \u201cGrease,\u201d the movie. But that\u2019s never bothered them.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey arranged a private screening for me, and I thought, \u2018They\u2019ve turned it into bubble gum,\u2019\u201d says Waissman.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Adds Moore: \u201cThe movie is a success because it\u2019s the \u201850s seen through the eyes of the \u201870s. That would not have been my choice. It wasn\u2019t the nitty-gritty show we did. But when the movie came out, I threw a party, which \u2018Grease\u2019 paid for. \u2018Grease\u2019 has been very generous to all of us.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In 1972, the hit Broadway musical \u201cGrease\u201d was ready to go on the road, which meant that a new cast had to be put together.
