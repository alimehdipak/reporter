The Giants first-base coach said the incident started when Shildt, who is the Padres&#8217; third-base coach, approached San Francisco&#8217;s dugout.<\/p>\n<p>After a brief exchange between the coaches, Richardson said Shildt, who is white, yelled, &#8220;You need to control that motherf&#8212;er&#8221; to the Giants&#8217; dugout, which prompted Richardson&#8217;s reaction and ultimately his ejection by umpire Greg Gibson.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;[Shildt] yelled, &#8216;You need to control that motherf&#8212;er,'&#8221; Richardson told reporters. &#8220;At that point in time, I went to the top step and said, &#8216;Excuse me?&#8217; because I couldn&#8217;t believe what I heard. At that point in time, Gibson, the crew chief, decided to toss me from the game.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I say this because his words were disproportionately unwarranted and reeked undertones of racism when he referred to me as &#8216;that motherf&#8212;er,&#8217; as if I was to be controlled or a piece of property or enslaved. I think it&#8217;s just really important we understand what happened tonight.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And the second part that&#8217;s equally disappointing is that me being tossed by that umpire empowers this coach to continue to have conversations like that with people like me, and that&#8217;s really unfortunate that&#8217;s what happened tonight.&#8221;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/photo\/2022\/0413\/r999018_1296x1296_1-1.jpg&amp;w=130&amp;h=130&amp;scale=crop&amp;location=center\" width=\"65\" height=\"65\" \/><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Richardson said he did not curse or use any vulgar language at any point during the incident but was told he was ejected for &#8220;instigating.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The umpire said to me that I was instigating,&#8221; Richardson said. &#8220;At that point in time, I asked: &#8216;This person called me a motherf&#8212;er, and I&#8217;m being an instigator?'&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Neither Shildt nor Padres manager Bob Melvin commented on the incident Tuesday night, but Richardson and Shildt met for a brief conversation on the field before Wednesday afternoon&#8217;s game in San Francisco. Richardson and Shildt shook hands multiple times and hugged at one point during the exhange.<\/p>\n<p>Shildt is in his first season with the Padres after serving as the St. Louis Cardinals&#8217; manager for three-plus seasons, starting in 2018.<\/p>\n<p>Giants manager Gabe Kapler told reporters that he did not hear what Shildt said but that he agreed that the ejection was unwarranted and supports Richardson.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I trust Antoan&#8217;s judgment 100 percent,&#8221; Kapler said. &#8220;I trust Antoan&#8217;s judgment on the matter, and I know that Antoan was not out of control at all and that anything that was said to insinuate that he was is totally inappropriate. He didn&#8217;t instigate any part of this.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Richardson&#8217;s ejection led the Giants to use Nakken as their first-base coach for the remainder of the game, making her the first woman in Major League Baseball history to coach on the field during a regular-season game.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really excited that Alyssa got her opportunity to make her major league debut, and I&#8217;m very proud of her,&#8221; Richardson said. &#8220;I think she did a really wonderful job, and we got a win, so that&#8217;s the most important thing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Richardson, who is from the Bahamas, said he shared his account of the incident because he wants to help &#8220;people who look like me.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important that we bring awareness to this,&#8221; Richardson said. &#8220;Unfortunately, this is what exists in our world, and I think it&#8217;s important that we understand when we do make comments and we do take actions like this, what that means for communities.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I share this story not just for myself but I share this story for other people that look like me. I know I&#8217;ve had the full support of my teammates and others, that I would be letting them down if I did not share this story tonight.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>San Francisco Giants coach Antoan Richardson, whose ejection Tuesday led to Alyssa Nakken&#8217;s historic coaching debut, has accused San Diego Padres coach Mike Shildt of yelling an expletive at him that &#8220;reeked undertones of racism.&#8221;Richardson, who is Black, provided a lengthy explanation for his third-inning ejection after San Francisco&#8217;s 13-2 victory over San Diego.
