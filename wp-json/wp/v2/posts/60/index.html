Beth is wine saleswoman who\u2019s pushing 40, lives in Manhattan, has vapid boyfriend who\u2019s the life of the party, Matt (\u201cInside Amy Schumer\u201d alum Kevin Kane), and a difficult relationship with her self-absorbed mom, Jane (Laura Benanti). Despite having a life that has all the trappings of success, Beth feels stagnant.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/BETH_JP_106_00314RT.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Amy Schumer and Michael Cera sit in a hospital room laughing. \" \/>Beth (Amy Schumer) is a woman in need of change when she meets John (Michael Cera) on \u201cLife &amp; Beth.\u201d Jeong Park    <\/p>\n<p>A sudden family tragedy sends her back to her Long Island childhood home. There, she meets new friends and reconnects with old acquaintances, has flashbacks to her formative younger years (young Beth is played by Violet Young), and meets new crush John (Michael Cera), a groundskeeper at a Long Island vineyard.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>As a woman who\u2019s feeling lost and just going through the motions in life, Beth is a far cry from the bold persona that Schumer became famous for (both in her stand-up and in her 2015\u00a0blockbuster, \u201cTrainwreck\u201d). It\u2019s not a bad thing, but viewers who are expecting her usual schtick won\u2019t get that, here. She\u2019s got some witty one-liners but she\u2019s mostly a reactive character. The show\u2019s humor comes more from minor side characters, such as Hank Azaria as a funeral home director who is borderline delirious because he\u2019s trying out \u201cintermittent fasting,\u201d or her clueless co-workers.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/BETH_MP_104_00286RT.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Michael Cera and Amy Schumer in a kitchen. \" \/>John (Michael Cera) and Beth (Amy Schumer) on \u201cLife &amp; Beth.\u201dMarcus Price    <\/p>\n<p>Although \u201cLife &amp; Beth\u201d has amusing moments, it\u2019s more moody and introspective than laugh out loud funny. It\u2019s peppered with borderline surreal sequences \u2013 for instance, when she gets bored in the middle of a conversation, jazz music starts playing over the people that she\u2019s talking to, tuning them out, while the shot zooms in on Beth\u2019s wide eyes. Intermittent flashbacks to her childhood add to the show\u2019s more cerebral feeling, anchoring it in Beth\u2019s perspective.<\/p>\n<p>The show tries to be too many things at once \u2013 skipping its focus around from her job to her love life to her family to her memories of her youth \u2013 and because it often abruptly shifts in tone from melancholy to wacky, not all of them land.<\/p>\n<p>The end result feels uneven, but not unpleasant or poorly done. It\u2019s got some unexpected moments of poignancy, particularly when it explores her complicated relationship with her dad (Michael Rapaport).\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/BETH_JP_106_00566RT.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Amy Schumer and Michael Cera. \" \/>Beth (Amy Schumer) and John (Michael Cera) in \u201cLife &amp; Beth.\u201d Jeong Park    <\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a solid dramedy in the category of \u201c30 something woman re-thinks her life,\u201d even if it isn\u2019t as brilliant as some other entries in that genre (such as \u201cFleabag\u201d). And it shows creative maturity, since Schumer is not resting on her laurels in terms of tone or subject matter. \u201cLife &amp; Beth\u201d is not \u201cTrainwreck: The TV Show.\u201d There are some explorations of typical Schumer topics such as sex, drinking, and body image, but it\u2019s more subdued than her past work.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLife &amp; Beth\u201d is a mixed bag as a whole, but it\u2019s always a good thing when a creator who\u2019s as established as Schumer puts out a work that feels fresh and different.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Amy Schumer is back in a scripted TV show after a long absence \u2013 and the result is solid, if uneven.
