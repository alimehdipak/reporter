Grindr executives at the time did not believe that the data-sharing would pose any risk to user privacy, according to the Journal.<\/p>\n<p>App users often allow their locations to be detected in order to better match with potential dates who live nearby. That data is then shared with an ad network where several advertisers bid to post an ad to users\u2019 phones once they open the app.<\/p>\n<p>There could be hundreds or even thousands of advertisers in the ad network that gain access to real-time information about a user\u2019s precise whereabouts.
