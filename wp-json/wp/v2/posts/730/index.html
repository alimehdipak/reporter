Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>Meta is facing a worker stampede as its stock price has fallen from an all-time high of more than $380 in September to $216.49 on Friday. The slide started last fall as a damning series of leaks put massive political pressure on the company and kicked into overdrive as Meta started to feel the multibillion-dollar sting of privacy changes from Apple and Google that are pummeling its advertising business. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cPeople are definitely paying attention and are concerned about the stock price,\u201d Michael Solomon, who manages software engineers through his talent firm 10x Management, told The Post. \u201cI\u00a0think a lot of people have questions about if Meta is going to get out of this \u2014 if this could be the beginning of the end for them.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/Meta2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Meta\" \/>Meta\u2019s stock has tanked more than 40% after hitting an all-time high in September 2021.REUTERS    <\/p>\n<h2>\u2018In your interest to leave\u2019<\/h2>\n<p>When software engineers join companies like Meta, Google or Amazon, their compensation typically consists of a roughly 50\/50 mix of cash and stock options, with entry-level employees getting more cash and more experienced workers getting more stock, according to data from tech salary tracker levels.fyi.<\/p>\n<p>At Meta, new hires are typically given a set number of restricted stock units based on the company\u2019s average stock price around the time they were hired. That means there can be huge upsides for employees who join before a company\u2019s stock rockets \u2014 but it also leaves them vulnerable to downturns.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>For example, a Meta employee who was given $100,000 worth of restricted stock units around the company\u2019s September stock peak would now be left with roughly $57,000.<\/p>\n<p>It also means that opportunists from other companies \u2014 such as Microsoft, which is down 10.3% so far this year \u2014 can theoretically \u201cbuy the dip\u201d by taking a job at a beaten-down company like Meta, getting more stock options at a lower price.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/tech-worker.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Tech worker\" \/>Many tech workers have seen the value of their stock options fall.Getty Images\/iStockphoto    <\/p>\n<p>In response to a disgruntled \u201cMetamate\u2019s\u201d post on Blind, one Microsoft employee wrote, \u201cThe only people would be doing well are those who are currently transferring companies right now. I\u2019m doing exactly that and headed to Meta.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Laura Martin, a tech and media analyst with Needham &amp; Company, said that while many tech workers may feel loyal to their companies, it makes financial sense for many to switch jobs when the value of their options tanks. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to be making any money in your equity options for three years, it is in your interest to leave,\u201d Martin told The Post.  \u201cI agree with the decision to leave your current firm and go to a company and get stock at their current price.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/Mark-Zuckerberg5.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Meta\" width=\"618\" height=\"411\" \/>\u201cI\u00a0think a lot of people have questions about if Meta is going to get out of this \u2014 if this could be the beginning of the end for them,\u201d tech talent agent Michael Solomon said.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index has fallen 12.3% so far in 2022, while Apple stock has fallen 9.9%, Amazon stock 5.3% and Google stock 5.7%.<\/p>\n<p>With stock options becoming less valuable across the board, big tech companies are now realizing that cash is king, according to Richard Kramer, a tech analyst and founder of Arete Research. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe big tech firms are simply paying far higher cash compensation since the top five collectively have $345 billion of net cash,\u201d Kramer told The Post.\u00a0\u201cThe battle to secure top talent has not slowed down.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>The compensation often comes in the form of \u201ccash retention incentives,\u201d which are paid out contingent on employees staying with the company for a set number of years, according to Brian Kropp, chief of human resources research at the consulting firm Gartner. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/google-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Google\" \/>Google\u2019s stock has also fallen in 2022. Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs your stock price falls, the effectiveness of restricted stock units as a retention strategy becomes less and less,\u201d Kropp told The Post. <\/p>\n<p>And some engineers who are looking for cash rather than stock options have been able to negotiate massive payouts from Meta in recent months, according to Solomon, the talent agent. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re getting better offers because Meta knows they have to compensate,\u201d Solomon said. <\/p>\n<p>Meta did not respond to questions about measures it\u2019s taking to retain and attract talent.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/tech-worker2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Tech workers\" \/>Some smaller tech companies have been hit even harder than Meta.Getty Images    <\/p>\n<h2>\u2018Shares down a lot more than Meta\u2019<\/h2>\n<p>While the likes of Meta and Amazon have been battered in 2022, some smaller tech names that boomed during the pandemic have felt even more pain as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates and investors pull back from tech stocks.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Shares of Netflix, which boomed during lockdowns, have tanked 33.9% this year. Videoconferencing company Zoom\u2019s stock has plummeted from an all-time-high of $310 in September to just $116.28. And Robinhood, the stock trading app that capitalized on the \u201cmeme stock\u201d boom in 2020 and 2021, traded as high as $70 shortly after it went public last summer but has since plummeted to less than $13.50.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The list goes on, with employees from PayPal, e-commerce company Shopify, beleaguered fitness company Peloton and electric carmaker Rivian all griping about their companies\u2019 shares plummeting in recent months.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI joined Rivian in January and I\u2019m over 50% loss,\u201d one Rivian employee wrote accompanied by a \u201cfacepalm\u201d emoji.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The shakeout at lower-tier tech firms could help Meta and other big tech companies swoop in and recruit talent, at least partly making up for any stock slump-related departures, Kramer said. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey are recruiting from hundreds of other enterprise software companies, etc. that have shares down a lot more than Meta,\u201d he said.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Kramer added that the biggest tech companies don\u2019t actively poach each other\u2019s employees because it would be a \u201crecipe for wage inflation.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>However, that doesn\u2019t stop workers from one big tech firm choosing to apply for jobs at another.\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Shares of Facebook and Instagram parent Meta have plummeted more than 40% over the past six months \u2014 and some employees saddled with underwater stock options are eyeing the exits. \u201cJoined Meta&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":731,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[14],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/730"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=730"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/730\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=730"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=730"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=730"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
