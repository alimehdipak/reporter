This is because the retainer contains several small acrylic teeth that are tightly held in place by a metal frame. If the frame is too tight, it can cause pain when you try to remove the retainer.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Symptoms of a Retainer:<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Retainers are a popular choice for teeth restoration. However, they can cause symptoms if not properly fitted and maintained. Symptoms of a retainer may include pain, inflammation, redness, and swelling. If you experience any of these symptoms, be sure to seek medical attention.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Causes of a Retainer<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A retainer is a type of <a href=\"https:\/\/dailygram.com\/index.php\/blog\/959917\/what-are-the-disadvantages-of-dental-crowns\/\">dental<\/a> appliance that is worn in the front teeth to hold the teeth in their correct position. Over time, the tooth may come in contact with other teeth or the gum tissue and cause the retainer to rub against the tooth. This can lead to wear on both the retainer and the <a href=\"https:\/\/6001591e016b5.site123.me\/blog\/how-long-does-it-take-to-recover-from-a-tooth-extraction\">tooth<\/a>, which can eventually cause it to break. There are several factors that can contribute to a retainer breaking, including genetics, stress from daily use, and aging. If you experience pain or difficulty breathing when you eat or drink, it is advisable to have your retainer replaced.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Treatment options for a Retainer<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Retainers can be a source of pain and discomfort. Treatment options include pain relievers, antibiotics, or surgery.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pain reliever medications such as ibuprofen may help reduce the pain and inflammation caused by retainers. Antibiotics can also be effective in treating bacteria that may cause inflammation or infection. If retainers are causing severe pain and swelling, surgery may be the best option to relieve the symptoms.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Conclusion<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your retainer hurts, it is likely because you are not wearing it correctly. Check with your dentist to make sure they have prescribed the correct size and type of retainer for your unique teeth and mouth. Finally, always be sure to brush and floss after every meal, as this will help remove any food particles that may be causing the retainer to irritate.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you have a retainer, you&#8217;ve probably noticed that it can sometimes hurt when you try to remove it.
