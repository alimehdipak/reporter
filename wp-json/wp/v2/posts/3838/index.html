He was released from the hospital in 2016 and has since been living in a Virginia community under court supervision. <\/p>\n<p>Hinckley was officially released from court oversight Wednesday and planned to celebrate his freedom by performing 17 original songs at the Brooklyn show. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cA big thank you to everyone who helped me get my unconditional release.
