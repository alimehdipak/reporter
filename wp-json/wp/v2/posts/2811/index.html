Diamond and her first husband, Harold Diamond \u2014 who died in 1982 at age 56 \u2014 moved into the Eldorado in the mid-1960s as renters. When the two-towered complex became a co-op in 1982, the couple purchased the duplex and an adjoining 19th-floor apartment. David Diamond, the eldest son of Hester, told the Times his parents purchased both apartments for some $1.2 million \u2014 roughly $3.65 million in today\u2019s figures. However, in November that year while renovations were ongoing, Harold passed away.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/2-Living-Room.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Hester Diamond, a known art world titan, filled the duplex with flair.\" \/>Hester Diamond, a known art world titan, filled the duplex with flair.Courtesy of The Corcoran Group    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/8-Primary-Bedroom.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Located in the famed Eldorado co-op, features include plaster moldings and oversize windows.\" \/>Located in the famed Eldorado co-op, features include plaster moldings and oversize windows.Courtesy of The Corcoran Group    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/hester-diamond-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Hester Diamond, right, passed away in 2020.\" \/>Hester Diamond, right, passed away in 2020.Donald Bowers    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"728\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/mike-diamond-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Mike D, now 56, spent his early years in the unit.\" \/>Mike D, now 56, spent his early years in the unit.WireImage    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe renovation was completed in the summer of 1983, and the apartment was fully put back together in the fall,\u201d David \u2014 a 63-year-old marketing and strategic planning consultant \u2014 told the Times. \u201cBut by then, it was clear that the renovated apartment was really my mom\u2019s apartment. It was, in a real sense, the start of her new life.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In 2009, meanwhile, the footprint grew larger after Hester Diamond purchased an adjacent two-bedroom unit on the 18th floor. The listing shows the home is being marketed as a six-bedroom dwelling with seven full bathrooms and a powder room.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPretty much every room in the house changed its function at least once during the 50 years my mom lived there,\u201d Michael Diamond, 56, told the paper.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/6-Dining-Room.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"The listing's many perks include a large dining area.\" \/>The listing\u2019s many perks include a large dining area.Courtesy of The Corcoran Group    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/9B-Kitchen.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"The eat-in kitchen, which is also roomy, has an eat-in nook.\" \/>The eat-in kitchen, which is also roomy, has an eat-in nook.Courtesy of The Corcoran Group    <\/p>\n<p>During their time shared in the building, the couple began collecting art. Hester worked as a social worker, while Harold was a teacher \u2014 and they eventually settled on careers in the art world, setting up their own business. In addition to dealing art, Hester was also an interior designer \u2014 and her collection of paintings and sculptures was spread throughout the home. It included works by Picasso, and she was known for pairing antiques with bold modernist art, then doing a 180 and mixing modern furnishings with art by the old masters.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI loved her fearlessness and her vision that she had, to switch so dramatically and radically,\u201d Michael told the Times. David added, \u201cWhen I was a kid, my friends would say I lived in a museum.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/7-Gallery.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Touches also include herringbone oak floors.\" \/>Touches also include herringbone oak floors.Courtesy of The Corcoran Group    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/3-Living-Room-Detail.jpeg?w=1024\" alt=\"A detail shot of the grand living room.\" \/>A detail shot of the grand living room.Courtesy of The Corcoran Group    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/9A-Terrace-off-Primary-Bedroom.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"The duplex doesn't shy on terrace space.\" \/>The duplex doesn\u2019t shy on terrace space.Courtesy of The Corcoran Group    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/1-Reservoir-View.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Views include the Central Park Reservoir.\" \/>Views include the Central Park Reservoir.Courtesy of The Corcoran Group    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/4-Terrace.jpeg?w=1024\" alt=\"Even more terrace space.\" \/>Even more terrace space.Courtesy of The Corcoran Group    <\/p>\n<p>As it stands, however, the duplex is empty. In early 2021, Sotheby\u2019s auctioned off $26.7 million worth of Hester\u2019s keep \u2014 including the carved \u201cAutumn\u201d sculpture by Pietro and Gian Lorenzo Bernini and Pieter Coecke Van Aelst\u2019s \u201cA Triptych: The Nativity.\u201d Other belongings were donated or split between surviving family members. Michael added that Hester\u2019s corner office was lined with Beastie Boys gold records.<\/p>\n<p>The apartment\u2019s main entrance is on the 19th floor. The foyer, in part, leads to a 29-foot-long living room, where Hester enjoyed entertaining guests and relaxing. There\u2019s a big eat-in kitchen with chef-grade appliances, a master bedroom with a terrace and, on the level below, the rest of the bedrooms \u2014 two of which lead to more terrace space.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Among the other perks: herringbone oak flooring and plaster moldings that complement more recent additions, including central air conditioning. The listing images also show good views of Central Park and the Billionaires\u2019 Row towers along the midtown skyline.<\/p>\n<p>Amy Katcher, of Corcoran, holds the listing with Michael J.
