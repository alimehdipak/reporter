Up a flight of stone steps, tucked behind a wooden door surrounded by dense foliage, sits a claw-foot tub where Peterson has been known to kick back with a gin and tonic from time to time.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had it for about 10 years,\u201d Peterson says of the chic al fresco sanctuary. \u201cMy most memorable baths have included listening to coyotes, owls and hawks. It\u2019s such a lovely way to relax and connect with nature.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A bit further north, Canadian neuroscientist and eco-enthusiast Maria Ramey is also communing with the great outdoors. In fact, her skin-care brand, Understory Botanicals, is named for the vegetation growing beneath the main canopy of the forest.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I was thinking about a name for my brand, Understory just fit perfectly,\u201d Ramey notes. \u201cThe understory is the middle ground of the\u00a0forest \u2014 a place that is forever changing, yet effortlessly balanced. It symbolized exactly what my brand stands for, the balance between plants and science, between the garden and the lab.\u201d \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"749\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/forest-beauty-versace.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=749\" alt=\"Model in Versace in forest.\" \/>Alexina Graham wears verdant Versace for Alexa.Eduardo Rezende    <\/p>\n<p>Ramey drew inspiration from her childhood, which included family walks in the Carolinian forest of southwestern Ontario. \u201cWhether going to beautiful national parks like Point Pelee or smaller\u00a0local forests,\u201d she says, \u201cthe feeling of being among trees always puts me in awe.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Jennifer Walsh, author of the \u201cWalk Your Way Calm\u201d interactive journal, couldn\u2019t agree more. A faculty advisor to Massachusetts General Hospital\u2019s Brain Health Initiative, Walsh has been leading Wellness Walks in Central Park, which help participants clear their heads, get some exercise and breathe in phytoncides (aka healthy volatile compounds that activate our immunity-boosting \u201cnatural killer\u201d cells). Think of those park jaunts as the New York equivalent of shinrin-yoku, or Japanese forest bathing.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Can\u2019t hang out in the woods right now? No problem. Simply spritz on the Nue Co.\u2019s wildly popular Forest Lungs. Crafted by perfumer Guillaume Flavigny, the unisex \u201canti-stress fragrance\u201d features a blend of woodsy and citrus notes, namely pine, cedar and bergamot. The scent, which has garnered more than 800 positive reviews on the Nue Co. site, deploys olfactory chemistry to replicate phytoncides \u2014 essentially bringing the outside in. That\u2019s good news when you consider the fact that, per the brand\u2019s research, Americans spend upwards of 90 percent of our time indoors. And by 2050, 75 percent of the global population is expected to live in cities \u2014 far removed from nature\u2019s bounty. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>But with all the tree-hugging beautifiers available now, don\u2019t let the urban sprawl stop you from getting your forest fix.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2>Nature Bathing Forest Bath Soak, $38 at True Botanicals<\/h2>\n<p>        <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/forest-beauty-true-botanicals.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"\" \/>Courtesy of the designer            <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/forest-beauty-sussane-kaufmann.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Mountain Pine bath oil, $81 at SusanneKaufmann.com\" \/>Courtesy of the designer        <\/p>\n<h2>Canadian Pine &amp;
