Kennedy. But the dress appeared to be \u201cmissing\u201d a few crystals, claimed the account, which added that others seemed to be \u201changing by a thread.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Kardashian, 41, vowed to not make any alterations to the dress \u2014 declared a \u201cnational treasure\u201d to The Post by one noted Monroe expert \u2014 and altered <em>herself<\/em> instead. She now infamously admitted that she lost 16 pounds in three weeks in order to squeeze into the dress.<\/p>\n<p>She was finally able to fit it over her famous derriere but was unable to zip it \u2014 hence why she draped herself with a white fur shawl while on the carpet.  <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI tried it on and it didn\u2019t fit me,\u201d Kardashian\u00a0recalled on the red carpet\u00a0as she retold the tale of her first fitting. \u201cIt was such a challenge.

Museum in Orlando bought the dress for $4.8 million. After taxes and fees, the total price was valued at over $5 million. Ripley\u2019s told The Post that the piece is the \u201cworld\u2019s most expensive dress\u201d ever sold at an auction. The dazzling gown is now valued at over $10 million.<\/p>\n<p>The reality star-turned-businesswoman only wore Monroe\u2019s artifact for a matter of minutes. She slipped into the gown in a dressing room near the Met Gala carpet and\u00a0changed into a replica gown\u00a0as soon as she made it up the steps.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/kim-kardashian-monroe-dress-damage-02.jpg?w=683\" alt=\"Kim Kardashian admitted that Munroe's dress did not fit when she first tired it on. \" \/>Kim Kardashian admitted that Monroe\u2019s dress did not fit when she first tired it on.
