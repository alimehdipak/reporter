But lately, pickleball \u2014 a cross between, tennis, ping-pong and badminton \u2014 has become borderline bougie.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t expect to visit the Hamptons this summer, for example, without encountering a waitlist for the three new courts at Dune Deck Beach Club.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you walk into any of our clubs between the hours of 8 a.m. and 12 p.m. the courts are packed,\u201d said Mike Meldman, founder and chairman of Discovery Land Company, owner of the exclusive Hamptons beach club residences.<\/p>\n<p>Hamptonites who don\u2019t want to wait (or can\u2019t afford Dune Deck\u2019s $350,000 annual membership dues) are playing at the Barn in Westhampton, Sportime in Amagansett and Around the Post Pickleball, LLC, in Hampton Bays.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Pickleball is infiltrating other tony ZIP codes, too. All of Discovery\u2019s luxury resort communities \u2014 from Barbuda to Portugal \u2014 now have pickleball courts. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/dune-deck-westhampton-2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Exterior of women at Dune Deck Beach Club.\" \/>Exclusive Dune Deck Beach Club has not one but three new pickleball courts.Julie Florio    <\/p>\n<p>And on the West Coast, country clubs are converting tennis courts into pickleball courts at warp speed. \u201cHillcrest Country Club is adding courts, Brentwood Country Club is adding courts \u2014 all the main country clubs here are adding courts,\u201d said Matt Manasse, dubbed the \u201cPickleball Coach to the Stars\u201d by Vanity Fair.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Last year Manasse was appointed the first-ever pickleball coach at the Pacific Palisades\u2019 prestigious Riviera Country Club in California. These days, the former professional tennis coach plays with celebrity picklers like Larry David, Matthew Perry and Drew Brees.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Pickleball isn\u2019t just newly fashionable among the jet set, it\u2019s fashion.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/picklebabes_EleVen_by_Venus_Williams_4.jpg?w=683\" alt=\"A sexy pickleball player.\" \/>EleVen by Venus Williams is adding a dose of style to the sport.

Alice + Olivia, meanwhile, welcomed the memo creating WASP-y luxury whites.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI decided to create pickleball outfits after seeing the explosive popularity of the sport during the pandemic and noticing that none of my girlfriends knew what to wear,\u201d said Stacey Bendet Eisner, the company\u2019s founder and CEO.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/pickleball-stock-11.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"A woman enjoying playing pickle ball in the sunshine.\" \/>Half tennis, half ping-pong, pickleball is the must-play sport of the season.  Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>Pickleball accessories are also getting posh.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI loved the Tory Sport tennis bag but, in all honesty, it was too preppy basic,\u201d said Lauren Bruksch, CEO and founder of Fenix Sportier.<\/p>\n<p>So, the former Barbie marketing director at Mattel recently launched her own collection of luxury pickleball accessories. Fenix Sportier bags are hand-sewn in the US by a gentleman who used to work for the likes of Louis Vuitton and Balenciaga. Bruksch calls her One Bag \u2014 which retails for $1,750 \u2014 the Bentley of pickleball bags. \u201cIt takes you from winning with a dink to having a drink at the bar.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/Indoor-pickleball-court-2-TheMLS.jpeg?w=1024\" alt=\"A pickleball court in Beverly Hills. \" \/>The West Coast is also getting in on the pickleball action at this indoor chandeliered court in ritzy Beverly Hills, Calif.Fenix Sportier   \t \t   <\/p>\n<p>Her $150 visor is also a bestseller. She has customers who buy it in multiple colors after realizing they \u201ccan\u2019t live without it.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Mainstream mid-luxury brands are dabbling in the pickleball business, too. Tommy Bahama is marketing its $110 IslandZone polo shirts as perfect for pickleball and \u201cwell-suited for serves and volleys.\u201d Vera Bradley is partnering with Baddle on a collection of paisley and floral-covered paddles starting at $150. It may seem like a lot, but it\u2019s a steal compared to the $333 Selkirk Labs paddle Manasse is currently eyeing. Now, that\u2019s a lot.<\/p>\n<p>For perspective, Amazon\u2019s No. 1 best-selling pickleball kit \u2014 which includes two paddles, four balls and a carrying bag \u2014 costs just $63.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, at high-end resorts like Rosewood Little Dix Bay in the BVI, it\u2019s no longer BYOP. Like the Ritz-Carlton Grand Cayman and Pebble Beach in California, Rosewood Little Dix Bay is practically buying pickleball equipment in bulk. The resort has even hired instructors to teach pickleball clinics \u2014 five days a week. It seems Americans, especially the one percent, can\u2019t get enough of the sport.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps no one knows this better than Tony Mariotti. The RubyHome real estate agent grew up in the Pacific Northwest \u2014 where pickleball was invented in 1965 \u2014 and fondly remembers his family having a pickleball court in their driveway. Currently, he\u2019s representing an $85 million home in Beverly Hills. <\/p>\n<p>One of its biggest selling points? An indoor pickleball court, of course.\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>America\u2019s fastest-growing sport is definitely popular among plebes.
