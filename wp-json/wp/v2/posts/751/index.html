So did the South Dakota Coyotes. The 11th-seeded Princeton Tigers and 12-seed Belmont Bruins came oh-so-close. And a wild two days of second-round play in the 2022 NCAA women&#8217;s basketball tournament ultimately gave us two double-digit seeds in the Sweet 16. All of it necessitates major changes to the seeding.<\/p>\n<p>The biggest adjustment comes right at the top. The South Carolina Gamecocks, who have been No. 1 all season, are no longer leading the way. With their two blowout victories, the Stanford Cardinal are the new No. 1 overall. That is just the beginning of the shake-up. When a No. 10 seed has been one of the most impressive teams in the tournament, big changes are coming, and South Dakota makes a big jump.<\/p>\n<p>The Coyotes eliminated an SEC team and a Big 12 squad, and each of those leagues have just two teams remaining in the field, the same number as the Big East. The Big Ten, which was rated the fifth-best conference in the country, according to the NET, sent four teams to the Sweet 16. The ACC, No. 4 on that list, also has four.<\/p>\n<p>And about that home-court advantage: Of the top 16 seeds hosting first- and second-round games, five failed to advance to the Sweet 16, and three more &#8212; the Indiana Hoosiers, Tennessee Lady Volunteers and UConn Huskies &#8212; barely survived.<\/p>\n<p>Now where do all these teams fall? Here is a brand-new Sweet 16 ranking after two more days of games.<\/p>\n<p>Follow this link for a complete look at Friday&#8217;s schedule and Saturday&#8217;s games, which are all on the ESPN family of networks.

Sunday&#8217;s performance was about Lexie Hull&#8217;s 36 points and Stanford&#8217;s 13 3-pointers against Kansas. Success can take on many different forms for the Cardinal. No team is as diverse or versatile. There is no better example than this: Stanford has won its two games by an average of 33.5 points, and Haley Jones has a total of 11 points. The Cardinal even showed some explosiveness. They led the Jayhawks by only three at halftime, but the lead was 34 less than 14 minutes later. The defending NCAA champion&#8217;s winning streak is up to 22 games, easily the longest in the country.<\/p>\n<p><em>Up next: vs. Maryland (Friday, 9:30 p.m. ET, ESPN)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/ncaa\/500\/2579.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<p>2.

Sunday&#8217;s outing was an extreme example of an ailing offense, but it was not the only symptom. South Carolina&#8217;s field goal rate hasn&#8217;t reach 40% in four of its past five games, and for the season, the Gamecocks rank 310th in the nation in 3-point rate. A free throw rate of 67% is also a concern. On the other hand, the defense is so good, the Gamecocks don&#8217;t slide too far. South Carolina has allowed just 54 total points in two games, shattering the old NCAA record of 71 (Oregon State, 2016) for fewest allowed in the opening two rounds. The Gamecocks also lead the nation in blocked shots and opponents&#8217; field goal percentage. There is no reason to believe the defense won&#8217;t continue to dominate in Greensboro.<\/p>\n<p><em>Up next: vs. North Carolina (Friday, 7 p.m. ET, ESPN)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/womens-college-basketball\/story\/_\/id\/33566988\/\" \/>play<\/p>\n<p>0:22<\/p>\n<p>NC State&#8217;s Raina Perez and Kayla Jones open up the game with 3-point shots against Kansas State.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/ncaa\/500\/152.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<p>3.

Against Kansas State in the second round, all eight players who saw action by the end of the third quarter had scored at least four points &#8212; and the player with just four was All-American Elissa Cunane. Without its star making an impact, NC State still led by 27 points before cruising in the fourth. The Wolfpack made seven of their first 11 shots from deep; they&#8217;ve made 36.7% of their 3-pointers this season, which ranks 10th in the country.<\/p>\n<p><em>Up next: vs. Notre Dame (Saturday, 11:30 a.m. ET, ESPN)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/ncaa\/500\/97.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<p>4.

Now it&#8217;s rock solid, even with hard-charging UConn right behind. Louisville was outstanding even when Hailey Van Lith was playing poorly in the first half of the season. She has looked like an All-American so far in the tournament, averaging 20.5 points per game on 50.0% shooting. But if the Cardinals are to make a fourth Final Four under Jeff Walz, it will be behind their defense, which is rated 10th by Her Hoop Stats.<\/p>\n<p><em>Up next: vs. Tennessee (Saturday, 4 p.m. ET, ESPN2)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/ncaa\/500\/41.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<p>5.

The Huskies had won those by an average of 31.7 points. Monday&#8217;s contest was nothing like that. The game was played exactly the way the Knights want to play. They dictated pace and physicality. Had UCF made more than 10 of 20 free throws and not committed 20 turnovers, UConn would not be advancing to a 28th consecutive Sweet 16. The Huskies were forced into doing things UConn teams rarely do. They missed nine of 11 layup attempts, shot 29.2% from the field, went the final 5:05 without a field goal, got outrebounded and had two players foul out. UConn&#8217;s 52 points were its lowest of the season. It was the ultimate survive-and-advance game for a program that hasn&#8217;t had a second-round game this close since 1999.<\/p>\n<p><em>Up next: vs. Indiana (Saturday, 2 p.m. ET, ESPN)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/ncaa\/500\/251.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<p>6.

By no coincidence, his star freshmen, Rori Harmon and Aaliyah Moore, are playing their best basketball. The 6-foot-1 Moore&#8217;s 18 and 21 points in the first two rounds are the two highest-scoring games of her young career. Point guard Harmon has 19 assists in two tournament games, following a 20-point game in the Big 12 championship game. A team that has won all season because of its defense (rated the eighth best by Her Hoops Stats) has found its offense, which is averaging 77.0 PPG since the start of the Big 12 tournament.<\/p>\n<p><em>Up next: vs. Ohio State (Friday, 7 p.m. ET, ESPN2)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/womens-college-basketball\/story\/_\/id\/33566988\/\" \/>play<\/p>\n<p>0:27<\/p>\n<p>Grace Berger puts Indiana up for good with a late fourth-quarter bucket.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/ncaa\/500\/84.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<p>7.

They needed every day of that experience to survive Princeton, which erased a 14-point third-quarter deficit and came within a possession of being the first Ivy League team to reach the Sweet 16. A spinning layup by Grace Berger, in her fourth season, with 31 seconds left, and a steal by Ali Patberg, in her fifth season but seventh year in college, were the difference to secure Indiana&#8217;s second straight Sweet 16 appearance. All five of those starters average in double figures, with Berger leading the way at 14.0 PPG. She also led the way on Monday with 15 points.<\/p>\n<p><em>Up next: vs. UConn (Saturday, 2 p.m. ET, ESPN)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/womens-college-basketball\/story\/_\/id\/33566988\/\" \/>play<\/p>\n<p>0:17<\/p>\n<p>Maddie Nolan buries the longball to extend the Wolverines&#8217; lead in the fourth quarter.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/ncaa\/500\/130.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<p>8.

First, they swung the ball around the perimeter and made two or three extra passes until freeing open sharpshooter Maddie Nolan for a 3-pointer. On the next trip down the floor, a crisp pass to the low post found star senior Naz Hillmon for a layup. That sequence pushed Michigan&#8217;s lead into double figures on the way to the Wolverines&#8217; second straight Sweet 16 appearance after never having been there before. Hillmon dominated with her 50th career double-double (27 points, 11 rebounds), but Leigha Brown&#8217;s 18 points were even more important. Michigan&#8217;s second-leading scorer, Brown is healthy again, and she played in just her fourth game after missing a month with a leg injury.<\/p>\n<p><em>Up next: vs. South Dakota (Saturday, 6:30 p.m. ET, ESPN2)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/ncaa\/500\/66.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<p>9.

Iowa State hasn&#8217;t lost a quarter since. As she so often does for the Cyclones, Ashley Joens was the catalyst against the Mavs with 36 points and 15 rebounds. In the blowout of Georgia, Joens deferred to guards Lexi Donarski and Emily Ryan, and Iowa State&#8217;s defensive game plan did the rest, limiting the Lady Dogs to 30.4% shooting. Typically, the Cyclones win with their shooting. They lead the country in 3-point rate (38.9%) and are fourth in free throw rate (81.0%), but they are a sneaky good defensive rebounding team (13th nationally) and defend without sending their opponent to the line (third in free throw rate defense).<\/p>\n<p><em>Up next: vs. Creighton (Friday, 9:30 p.m. ET, ESPN2)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/ncaa\/500\/120.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<p>10.

Ashley Owusu is healthy, Diamond Miller looks comfortable again and Angel Reese has regained her inside dominance. They are playing like the big three they were projected to be, and they combined for 65 of the Terps&#8217; 89 points against FGCU. The Terps are the second-highest scorers in the tournament so far, something more reminiscent of the squad that led the nation in points per game a year ago.<\/p>\n<p><em>Up next: vs. Stanford (Friday, 9:30 p.m. ET, ESPN)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/womens-college-basketball\/story\/_\/id\/33566988\/\" \/>play<\/p>\n<p>1:40<\/p>\n<p>The Fighting Irish punch their ticket to the Sweet 16 as they take care of Oklahoma with ease, 108-64.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/ncaa\/500\/87.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<p>11.

The Sooners, third in the country in pace, felt they could run with Notre Dame. They couldn&#8217;t &#8212; and the 44-point defeat tied for the largest ever by a top-four seed in NCAA tournament history. Freshman point guard Olivia Miles routinely dribbled into space and then found shooters. That helped Dara Mabrey to seven 3-pointers and 29 points. Sonia Citron (25 points) and Maya Dodson (20 points) got layup after layup. For the second straight game, Miles reached double digits in assists, with 12, and Notre Dame&#8217;s 108 points were a season high. Miles&#8217; 23 assists are the most for a player in her first two tournament games since 2000. Now the Irish face a very familiar opponent in the Sweet 16. Notre Dame was the only ACC team to beat the Wolfpack this season.<\/p>\n<p><em>Up next: vs. NC State (Saturday, 11:30 a.m. ET, ESPN)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/ncaa\/500\/233.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<p>12.

They might still be underseeded here. In 80 minutes against Power 5 teams Ole Miss and Baylor, South Dakota has yet to trail. Coach Dawn Plitzuweit&#8217;s defense has completely shut down two prospective top-five WNBA draft picks in Shakira Austin and NaLyssa Smith. That shouldn&#8217;t be too much of a surprise. The Yotes ranked ninth in the country this season in points allowed per game. They just hadn&#8217;t been this good against the Power 5 teams they played in November and December, including South Carolina, Northwestern and Oklahoma. One more win and Chloe Lamb and Hannah Sjerven will become national stars. They have been conference stars nearly their entire careers in the Summit League, with Lamb this year&#8217;s player of the year and Sjerven a two-time defensive player of the year.<\/p>\n<p><em>Up next: vs. Michigan (Saturday, 6:30 p.m. ET, ESPN2)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/womens-college-basketball\/story\/_\/id\/33566988\/\" \/>play<\/p>\n<p>0:21<\/p>\n<p>Sara Puckett hits a corner three with seconds remaining in the fourth quarter against Belmont in the NCAA tournament.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/ncaa\/500\/2633_ncw.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<p>13.

The Lady Vols beat a No. 13 and a No. 12 seed to reach the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2016, and their best player in both games, Alexus Dye (38 points and 22 rebounds in the two games), previously played for Troy, which was a No. 15 seed a year ago.<\/p>\n<p><em>Up next: vs. Louisville (Saturday, 4 p.m. ET, ESPN2)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/womens-college-basketball\/story\/_\/id\/33566988\/\" \/>play<\/p>\n<p>0:17<\/p>\n<p>Carlie Littlefield dribbles to the baseline and puts up a nice layup around a defender.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/ncaa\/500\/153.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<p>14.
