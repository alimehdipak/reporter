Since 2005, the 82-year-old Art Deco theater has sat vacant, nearly home to numerous tenants \u2014 Urban Outfitters, Planet Fitness, Alamo Drafthouse, an arts education nonprofit \u2014 all of which eventually fell through.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Now, though, it\u2019s official: A lease has finally been signed and the historic building will stay a cinema.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere have been so many false starts and failed plans at The Metro; I think a lot of us started to feel like Charlie Brown with the football and had given up being excited,\u201d Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine told The Post. When he heard yet another potential business was interested in bringing back the Broadway building, \u201cI decided that I wouldn\u2019t celebrate until I heard it directly from a tenant that a lease had been signed.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>And now that\u2019s finally happened.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is real, I heard it direct from the head of the company: The lease has been signed so there\u2019s no turning back,\u201d he went on. \u201cThey\u2019re asking for a bit of anonymity at this point, but I can tell you unambiguously that this is real, it\u2019s happening, and it\u2019s a best case scenario.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The 10,260-square-foot building will become a \u201cCommunity Entertainment\u201d and \u201cmulti-screen cinema center, with restaurant facilities and community meeting rooms on a rental basis,\u201d longtime owner Albert Bialek told The West Side Rag. Since being built in the 1930s, the two-story building has housed an art house cinema, pornography theater and two national movie chains, and still boasts the same landmarked exterior. Its interior, however, has since been gutted.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/metro-theater-3.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"metro theater lease signed 2022\" \/>A sign advertising the space in February 2021.James Keivom for NY Post    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/metro-theater-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"metro theater lease signed 2022\" \/>The Metro Theater at 2626 Broadway, circa 1994.Museum of the City of New York\/Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt kind of works for this new format because it\u2019s going to be a large number of smaller screens,\u201d Levine noted optimistically of the blank interior canvas.<\/p>\n<p>The yet unnamed company of \u201crenowned people\u201d from California are refusing to reveal their identity until they \u201cfile their plans\u201d in the next few weeks, but they\u2019ll offer movie-goers an alcohol-equipped dine-in film experience, the Rag reported.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In response to The Post\u2019s inquiry, movie chain Alamo Drafthouse \u2014 which almost built a five-screen theater in the space before backing out in 2012 \u2014 offered no comment regarding if it is the secret new tenant.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The news is a huge boon for the area, which has lost a lot of businesses during the pandemic and is now pockmarked by empty storefronts.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a rough two years,\u201d said Levine, who represented part of the Upper West Side during his time on New York City Council from 2014 to 2021. \u201cWe had feared this would be a chain clothing store or a pharmacy, although anything would\u2019ve been better than abandonment.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Its vacancy has indeed been not only sad but also expensive: Bialek has been charged over $840,000 in city property taxes in the time the address has remained vacant, the Real Deal previously reported.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is gonna transform that area,\u201d Levine went on enthusiastically. \u201cThis is just the boost that the neighborhood needed.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After a very long intermission, this theater is finally set to return.
