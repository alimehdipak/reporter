It requires higher-order skills like planning and prioritizing,\u201d said Dr. Michael Manos, the clinical director of the Center for Attention and Learning at Cleveland Clinic Children\u2019s.<\/p>\n<p>But many kids struggle with this type of skill because the prefrontal cortex is not fully developed until when they reach adulthood at age 25, per the news outlet.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>But Manos noted: \u201cIf kids\u2019 brains become accustomed to constant changes, the brain finds it difficult to adapt to a nondigital activity where things don\u2019t move quite as fast.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cTikTok is a dopamine machine.
