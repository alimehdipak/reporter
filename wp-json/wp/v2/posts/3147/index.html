Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>Ratings for this year\u2019s broadcast were up 58%, with an average 16.6 million viewers tuning in. In comparison, a paltry 9.8 million Americans watched the 2021 show. <\/p>\n<p>Many people tuned in to the ceremony after Smith, 53, stormed the stage and slapped Rock across the face. The violent act was caused by a G.I. Jane joke Rock made about Jada Pinkett Smith, who suffers from\u00a0hair loss condition, alopecia.<\/p>\n<p>However, Erwich insisted that viewer numbers were already up before the slap took place, stating: \u201cEven before that very unfortunate moment, the show started off up year over year, and we came back in a big way.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The ceremony was hosted by Wanda Sykes, Amy Schumer and Regina Hall, with the ABC boss asserting that trio delivered for the network.  <\/p>\n<p>Erwich also said of the show\u2019s producers: \u201cIf you look at what they were trying to do, which is really bring entertainment back to the program, they had three amazing hosts, clips, and incredible musical performances, I thought it was a great way for the show to reclaim its place on the mantle.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/wanda-sykes-99.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Sykes was hosting the Oscars on the night Smith stormed the stage and slapped Rock.
