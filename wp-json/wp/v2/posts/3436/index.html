There are many ways to prevent cavities and keep your smile healthy. Here are five tips:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Why Preventing Cavities is Important<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Preventing cavities is important because it can prevent tooth decay and future <a href=\"https:\/\/hotmedia.site\/blogs\/149694\/How-long-do-you-have-to-wait-to-get-dentures\">dental issues<\/a>. Cavities form when food and plaque build-up in the spaces between teeth. When this happens, bacteria ferment the food and produce acid. This acid weakens the enamel coating on your teeth, which can eventually lead to tooth decay and even a loss of tooth structure. The best way to prevent cavities is to maintain good oral hygiene habits, including regular brushing and flossing your teeth.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>1. Brush Your Teeth for Two Minutes<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brushing your teeth for two minutes can prevent tooth decay and gum disease.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is recommended that you brush your teeth for two minutes twice a day, morning and night. You should brush the chewing surfaces of your molars, the inside surfaces of your cheek and tongue, and the biting surfaces of your front teeth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should also use an interdental brush to get rid of any food particles that might be stuck between your teeth.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>2. Floss Daily to Remove Plaque from the Gums and Between Teeth<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flossing is an important part of the prevention of plaque and gum disease. Plaque is a sticky substance that forms on the teeth and gums. Gum disease is when plaque accumulates to the point where it can damage the tooth or bone around it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flossing removes plaque from between teeth and between the teeth and gums. It also helps to remove bacteria that can cause infection. In addition, flossing helps increase saliva flow which neutralizes bad bacteria in the mouth.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>3. Get Regular Dental Checkups and Professional Cleanings<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dental checkups and professional cleanings are important to maintain a healthy mouth. A <a href=\"https:\/\/6001591e016b5.site123.me\/blog\/how-long-do-dental-bridges-last\">dental<\/a> checkup is a routine oral examination of the teeth, gums, and other parts of the mouth. It is important to go to a dentist every six months for a dental checkup. Professional cleanings should be done every 3-6 months, depending on how often you brush your teeth and floss.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>4. Eat a Low-Sugar Diet Including Plenty of Mouth-Healthy Foods<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A low-sugar diet is a diet that limits the amount of sugar in one&#8217;s diet. It can be done by limiting or avoiding sugary drinks, candy, desserts, and other foods with added sugars.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A low-sugar diet is important for oral health because sugar feeds bacteria that cause tooth decay and gum disease. Sugar also causes inflammation in the mouth which can lead to tooth loss.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cavities are a problem that affects millions of people and can lead to tooth loss.
