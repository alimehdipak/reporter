This is because braces come in many different shapes and sizes, and they can be used for a variety of purposes. In this article, we will answer some of the most common questions about braces.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>What are the alternatives to metal braces?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many alternatives to metal braces that may be better suited for your specific needs. Depending on the severity of your dental issues, one or more of these alternatives could work well for you:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-Invisalign: This system uses clear plastic aligners that are custom-fit to your teeth. Over time, the aligners gradually move your <a href=\"https:\/\/houstontalk.org\/if-your-teeth-have-been-looking-dull-lately-these-5-foods-beverages-might-be-why\/\">teeth<\/a> into their correct positions, allowing you to avoid metal braces entirely.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-Ceramic Braces: These brackets are made from a hard ceramic material and are Custom Fit to Your Teeth. They&#8217;re less invasive than metal braces and can last up to 10 years.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-Pedi-Braces: Pedi-Braces use a rubber band around each tooth, which is then attached to a bracket on the wearer&#8217;s head.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>At what age should my child get braces?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When should a child get braces? This is a question many parents are asking themselves. The answer, unfortunately, depends on many factors including the child&#8217;s dental health and development. Generally speaking, most children should have braces when they&#8217;re between the ages of six and eighteen months old. However, this age range is not set in stone and can vary depending on a child&#8217;s individual teeth alignment and development. If your child&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/blogbuzzers.wordpress.com\/2022\/06\/15\/adventure-orthodontics\/\">dentist<\/a> feels they need braces earlier than this, they will be happy to discuss their options with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Do braces do anything other than improving my smile?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Braces do a lot more than just improve your smile. They can also correct teeth alignment, reduce gaps between teeth, and support your bite. In addition, braces can reduce the risk of developing dental problems in the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you choose to get braces, it\u2019s important to talk to your <a href=\"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/view\/blogbuzz\/more\/adventure\">doctor<\/a> about what type of braces are best for you. There are several different types of braces available, and each has its own benefits and drawbacks. Some popular types of braces include fixed orthodontic appliances (FAA), clear aligners, removable retainer systems (RRS), and Invisalign.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re considering getting braces, be sure to talk with your doctor about all the options available to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Do braces hurt?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most people believe that braces do hurt, but this is not always the case. In fact, according to a study published in the journal \u201cPediatrics\u201d in 2000, only about 5% of children who wear braces complain of any discomfort. This survey was done using a questionnaire that was specifically designed to measure discomfort levels associated with various dental treatments.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>How often do I need to brush my teeth with braces?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Braces are a great way to correct teeth&#8217; alignment. But like any other dental appliance, they need to be properly cared for in order to maintain their function and look. There are three key times you should brush your braces: before bed, in the morning, and after dinner. You should also brush your braces every day if you wear them during the day.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Most people are familiar with braces, but may still have questions about them.
