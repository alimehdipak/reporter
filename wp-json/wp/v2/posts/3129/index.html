He arrived as a number one so the situation is not easy. He has been a fantastic team player since day one and never let anybody down.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We did not have a conversation yet but I know that the goalkeeper coaches have these conversations at the moment and then we will take our time to speak with him and reflect on what&#8217;s best and what the possibilities are. As a coach, of course I&#8217;m super happy to have both strong goalkeepers so let&#8217;s see.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>21.41 BST: Major League Soccer&#8217;s New England Revolution are expecting interest in <b>Adam Buksa<\/b> from European clubs with many of their domestic seasons coming to an end, as reported by MLSsoccer.com, who add that informal discussions have already begun.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure that we will be sorting out a variety of offers over the next couple of weeks or so for the transfer window in Europe,&#8221; head coach and sporting director Bruce Arena told members of the media. &#8220;So, we&#8217;ll have to wait and see what happens with those types of offers and whether we&#8217;ll accept them or whatever. But he is sought after, and obviously his stints with the Polish national team are helpful and he&#8217;ll likely be playing in the [2022 FIFA] World Cup. So, he&#8217;s going to attract some interest.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>21.06 BST: After their relegation from the Premier League, Norwich City have confirmed the departures of various first-team players, including <b>Lukas Rupp<\/b> and <b>Josip Drmic<\/b>.<\/p>\n<p>They have added that <b>Billy Gilmour<\/b>, <b>Brandon Williams<\/b>, <b>Ozan Kabak<\/b> and <b>Mathias Normann<\/b> will all return to their respective parent clubs after the Canaries&#8217; final game of the season against Tottenham Hotspur.<\/p>\n<p>20.27 BST: Nice had been confident that they would be able to sign Nancy midfielder <b>Warren Bondo<\/b>, but Le 10 Sport have now suggested that Hamburg is the 18-year-old&#8217;s most likely destination. The likes of Montpellier, Lille, Rennes and Monaco had all shown interest, but it had appeared as though the teenager would join Nice until his head has seemingly been turned.<\/p>\n<p>Hamburg are 1-0 up against Hertha Berlin after the first leg in the Bundesliga&#8217;s promotion\/relegation play-off as they aim to reach the top tier.<\/p>\n<p>20.08 BST: More news in North London! Tottenham Hotspur are ready to make a move for <b>Alessandro Bastoni<\/b>, reports Corriere dello Sport, who add that the Internazionale centre-back is Antonio Conte&#8217;s priority as he aims to strengthen his defence.<\/p>\n<p>It would take at least \u20ac60m to \u20ac70m to bring him in, with Inter feeling that offloading the Italian would allow them to keep Lautaro Martinez, Milan Skriniar, Marcelo Brozovic and Nicolo Barella. There has been interest from Manchester City in the past while Manchester United could still make a move.<\/p>\n<p>19.37 BST: <b>Justin Kluivert<\/b>&#8216;s permanent transfer from Roma to Nice is in the balance after the latter failed to qualify for the Champions League, reports Sky Sports Italia.<\/p>\n<p>The Dutchman has spent the season on loan with Nice, who would have had an obligation to sign him permanently for \u20ac15m if they had reached Europe&#8217;s elite competition. They still want to sign the winger but are hoping to do so for a lower amount, which has left Roma frustrated.<\/p>\n<p>19.19 BST: After earning promotion to the Premier League, Fulham are lining up a move for West Ham United right-back <b>Ryan Fredericks<\/b>, as reported by the Evening Standard.<\/p>\n<p>The 29-year-old will be a free agent having not been offered a new deal after falling behind Vladimir Coufal and Ben Johnson in the pecking order. This leaves him able to return to Fulham, where he played over 100 times before joining the Hammers for free in 2018.<\/p>\n<p>18.51 BST: On their official channels, Mainz 05 have confirmed the signing of Bochum centre-back <b>Maxim Leitsch<\/b>.<\/p>\n<p>The 24-year-old joins on a contract that will run until 2026 for an undisclosed fee, having made a total of 93 appearances for Bocum in all competitions.<\/p>\n<p>18.18 BST: Up next, a look ahead to the summer around a very intriguing free agent forward. Spanish outlet AS has some thoughts on possible clubs for Paulo Dybala when his contract at Juventus expires at the end of June. With him unwilling to accept a reduced salary in any new contract, the Serie A giants are seemingly resigned to his departure.<\/p>\n<p>The 28-year-old Argentina international hasn&#8217;t had the best of times in Turin this season, but with 15 goals and six assists (all competitions) while coming in and out of the first-team is a promising return, and several clubs could use a scorer of that caliber. (That&#8217;s even more true with Erling Haaland&#8217;s move to Manchester City now confirmed, and the future of Kylian Mbappe to be revealed this Sunday.) AS reckons that everyone from Atletico Madrid and Barcelona, to Manchester United and Tottenham &#8212; plus Inter Milan! &#8212; would be realistic options and who could benefit from Dybala next season.<\/p>\n<p>17.24 BST: Here&#8217;s a scoop from ESPN&#8217;s own James Olley involving Tottenham. Sources tell ESPN that the club is exploring a move for free agent winger Ivan Perisic and that the Croatia international is enthused by the prospect of a reunion with his former manager at Inter Milan, Antonio Conte.<\/p>\n<p>Per Olley&#8217;s report: &#8220;Although Inter are continuing talks with the 33-year-old in an effort to find an agreement before his contract expires this summer, Perisic is increasingly likely to leave the club.&#8221; He mentions that Juventus are in pole position, but that Spurs remain an intriguing option given that Perisic and Conte won Serie A together last season.<\/p>\n<p>16.31 BST: Thomas Tuchel has said he hopes Todd Boehly can become Chelsea&#8217;s &#8220;lucky charm&#8221; once his consortium completes their purchase of the club and they can conduct transfer business again.<\/p>\n<p>The Los Angeles Dodgers part-owner is spearheading a bid worth \u00a34.25 billion which is expected to pass the Premier League&#8217;s owners and directors&#8217; test in the coming days. Talks are continuing between outgoing owner Roman Abramovich and the U.K. government amid a row over how the \u00a32.5bn sale money is distributed to victims of the war in Ukraine.<\/p>\n<p>Assuming the takeover goes ahead as planned, Boehly and Tuchel are expected to meet to discuss the club&#8217;s summer transfer plans.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We will be very open and very honest. He will get my point of view if he wants to have it. Of course, we lose key players and we struggle to win our home games,&#8221; Tuchel said. &#8220;He was at the final in Wembley. Maybe when the deal is done and he is our owner, he is the lucky charm that we need so we give him so more credit.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Chelsea remain hopeful the sale will be finalised before their special licence to continue operating ends on May 31 and, while the government seeks assurances no funds will find their way back to Abramovich, Boehly spent last week meeting players and staff of the men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s teams.<\/p>\n<p>Although Boehly&#8217;s attendance is not always advertised, it is thought the American businessman has not seen the men&#8217;s side win a game in person since entering into talks to buy the club. He attended Thursday&#8217;s 1-1 draw against Leicester City at Stamford Bridge after the FA Cup Final defeat to Liverpool, a home draw against Wolves and the Champions League quarterfinal first leg loss to Real Madrid.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Olley: Boehly has work ahead once Chelsea takeover is completed<\/p>\n<p>15.47 BST: Paul Pogba has reservations about playing for Manchester United at Crystal Palace on Sunday over fears he could be targeted by visiting supporters, sources told ESPN&#8217;s Rob Dawson.<\/p>\n<p>The France midfielder was booed by fans following the 3-2 win over Norwich at Old Trafford on April 16 and again when he was substituted because of injury after 10 minutes of the 4-0 defeat at Liverpool on April 19.<\/p>\n<p>Pogba has not featured since the loss at Anfield but has an outside chance of being available for the trip to Crystal Palace on Sunday &#8212; United&#8217;s last game of the season.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also likely to be the last game of Pogba&#8217;s United career, with his contract set to expire in June, but sources told ESPN that the 29-year-old is concerned he may get a negative reception at Selhurst Park if he was to be part of the squad.<\/p>\n<p>Sources close to Pogba insist he is yet to make a decision on his long-term future. Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus are leading the race to sign the World Cup winner on a free transfer in the summer. Sky reports that Juve are looking to take a big step this weekend in their hope of convincing Pogba to return to the club by offering him a contract with a net annual salary of \u20ac8.5m.<\/p>\n<p>Pogba has made 226 appearances since rejoining United from Juventus for a then world record \u00a389.3m fee in 2016 but it set to walk away for free for a second time after initially making the switch from Old Trafford to Juventus in 2012.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; O&#8217;Hanlon, Ogden: Flop or not? Evaluating Pogba&#8217;s Man United career (E+)<\/p>\n<p>15.03 BST: Juventus have told Alvaro Morata that they will not be exercising the option to buy the forward that was included in his loan deal with Atletico Madrid, Marca reports.<\/p>\n<p>According to the newspaper, the Serie A club informed Morata of their decision on Thursday as they do not have the money available to pay the stipulated \u20ac35m fee. That would see Spain forward Morata, 29 &#8212; who has scored 12 goals for Juve this season &#8211;facing an uncertain future on his return to Atletico this summer.<\/p>\n<p>Even with Luis Suarez leaving, the LaLiga side have Joao Felix, Antoine Griezmann, Matheus Cunha and Angel Correa competing for places in their attack.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this year Morata was linked as a possible target for Barcelona during the January transfer window.<\/p>\n<p>14.21 BST: Outgoing Chelsea defender Antonio Rudiger has suggested the club could have done more to convince him to stay prior to sanctions being imposed on the club.<\/p>\n<p>The 29-year-old will leave Stamford Bridge on a free transfer at the end of the season after agreeing a four-year deal with Real Madrid.<\/p>\n<p>Chelsea wanted Rudiger to sign an extension, but sources have told ESPN&#8217;s James Olley the club were unwilling to meet his wage demands. Chelsea made a final offer in excess of \u00a3220,000 a week but Rudiger&#8217;s deal with Madrid is worth \u00a3342,000 a week.<\/p>\n<p>Chelsea had been unable to hold further talks with Rudiger since March after owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the U.K government following Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine. The club were granted a special license to continue fulfilling fixtures but are prevented from signing and selling players or renegotiating existing contracts. However, Rudiger said in a piece with The Players&#8217; Tribune that Chelsea could have been more proactive in discussions earlier in the campaign.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, my contract negotiations had already started to get difficult last fall,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Business is business, but when you don&#8217;t hear any news from the club from August to January, the situation becomes complicated.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;After the first offer, there was a long gap of just nothing. We&#8217;re not robots, you know? You cannot wait for months with so much uncertainty about your future. Obviously, no one saw the sanctions coming, but in the end, other big clubs were showing interest, and I had to make a decision. I will leave it at that, because business aside, I have nothing bad to say about this club.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Chelsea will always be in my heart. London will always be my home. I came here alone, and now I have a wife and two beautiful kids. I also have a new brother for life named Kova [teammate Mateo Kovacic]. I have an FA Cup, a Europa League and a Champions League medal. And of course, I have hundreds of memories that will stay with me forever.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/espnmediazone.com\/us\/files\/2018\/03\/App-Icon-Android-7.png&amp;w=126&amp;site=espnfc\" width=\"30\" \/>13.34 BST: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is facing a battle to relaunch his career this summer amid concerns Liverpool&#8217;s transfer strategy could force him to see out the final year of his contract at Anfield, sources told ESPN&#8217;s Mark Ogden.<\/p>\n<p>Oxlade-Chamberlain, 28, has not appeared in Jurgen Klopp&#8217;s Premier League team since playing 62 minutes of the 3-1 win at home to Norwich in February and the former England midfielder was an unused substitute as a depleted Liverpool side won 2-1 at Southampton on Tuesday.<\/p>\n<p>Despite being fit and available, the former Arsenal player&#8217;s only first-team action during the past three months have been FA Cup outings against Norwich and Nottingham Forest.<\/p>\n<p>But while Liverpool are prepared to listen to offers for Oxlade-Chamberlain this summer, sources told ESPN the club will assess how much interest there is in him before setting a valuation on a player signed for \u00a335 million from Arsenal in 2017.<\/p>\n<p>12.49 BST: Borussia Dortmund manager Marco Rose has been sacked after just one season in charge, the club announced on Friday.<\/p>\n<p>Rose guided Dortmund to second in the Bundesliga this season, eight points behind champions Bayern Munich, who won their 10th consecutive league title.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;BVB and Coach Marco Rose end their relationship,&#8221; the club said in a statement on Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Following an intensive season analysis on Thursday, including Rose, Watzke, Zorc, Kehl, and Sammer, the club has decided to move forward, and wishes Marco Rose the best of luck in his next opportunity.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/espnmediazone.com\/us\/files\/2018\/03\/App-Icon-Android-7.png&amp;w=126&amp;site=espnfc\" width=\"30\" \/>12.02 BST: Real Madrid believe that Kylian Mbappe will announce a decision on his future this weekend, sources have told ESPN&#8217;s Alex Kirkland and Rodrigo Faez, with uncertainty around the situation causing &#8220;nervousness and confusion&#8221; over the club&#8217;s chances of signing the Paris Saint-Germain forward.<\/p>\n<p>According to sources, there is &#8220;pessimism&#8221; at Madrid over the potential deal while there is a similar level of uncertainty at PSG. Earlier this week, sources close to the Ligue 1 champions told ESPN the club had given up on keeping Mbappe because they thought he would join Madrid. However, with Mbappe expected to announce his definitive decision over the next few days, the France international has not communicated it to either club.<\/p>\n<p>Madrid &#8212; who have known for months that the player had given the OK to a move to the Bernabeu &#8212; do not understand his behaviour over the last two weeks, sources said.
