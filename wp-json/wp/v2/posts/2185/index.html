While age is known to be highly predictive of death, other risk factors within age strata are incompletely explored. This study challenges our dogma that comorbidities are the major drivers of severe outcomes like mechanical ventilation or death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Instead, we find that other physiological features that can be measured within one hour of hospitalization more strongly predict who will go on to severe outcomes,&#8221; said Dr. Jason Goldman, an infectious disease specialist at Swedish Providence and a member of the study team. &#8220;These findings remind the treating clinician to incorporate physiological parameters into risk stratification, and subsequently into decisions on treatment allocations.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The retrospective study examined the electronic health records of more than 6,900 patients between June 31 and November 15 of 2021. The vast majority of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 &#8212; 92 percent of the younger patients and 75 percent of the older patients &#8212; had not received COVID-19 vaccination.<\/p>\n<p>Existing risk models for hospitalized patients were developed early on in the pandemic. This research addresses the need for updated models that reflect current standard of care for COVID-19, where fewer uncommon labs are used, and more therapeutic treatment options are available. Future investigations will benefit from finer granularity of subdivisions by age, BMI, and more detailed variables on conditions and drugs that affect individual immune response.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Chronic medical conditions are still important risk factors for severe COVID-19. However, when a patient has just been admitted to the hospital, their current status can be more helpful in predicting what level of care they are likely to need,&#8221; said ISB Assistant Professor Dr. Jennifer Hadlock, corresponding author of the study. &#8220;As the standards of care for COVID-19 evolve, our risk models need to evolve with them.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The collaborative study was conducted by researchers at ISB, Swedish Providence, Onegevity and Mayo Clinic Jacksonville.<\/p>\n<p>Story Source:<\/p>\n<p>Materials provided by Institute for Systems Biology. <em>Note: Content may be edited for style and length.<\/em><\/p>\n<p> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedaily.com\/releases\/2022\/04\/220428085855.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A just-published study provides previously unknown answers about which hospitalized COVID-19 patients are most likely to need mechanical ventilation or to die.
