who stand to lose their job if Elon Musk completes his takeover of the company.<\/p>\n<p>Vijaya Gadde, who earned $17 million last year as Twitter\u2019s top legal counsel, could be on the chopping block as Musk is reportedly planning to slash jobs and reduce executive pay as he looks to secure financing for his Twitter bid.<\/p>\n<p>After disclosing plans to acquire the company earlier this month, Musk expressed \u201cno confidence\u201d in Twitter\u2019s current management \u2014 which doesn\u2019t bode well for their future once he takes the helm later this year. <\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Gadde also stands to win a nice consolation price if she\u2019s fired: a severance package worth $12.5 million that includes the accelerated vesting of a trove of Twitter shares she has accrued.<\/p>\n<p>The 48-year-old Gadde, who reportedly broke down in tears when addressing colleagues about the future of Twitter, has become a lightning rod for controversy in recent days due in no small part to Musk himself, who tweeted a meme that painted her as oblivious to a \u201cliberal bias\u201d at Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\"

on an appearance by Gadde and her then-boss, former CEO Jack Dorsey, on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast \u201cThe Joe Rogan Experience\u201d in 2019.<\/p>\n<p>During that appearance, conservative journalist Tim Pool confronted both Dorsey and Gadde about instances in which right-wing voices were banned from Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>The Musk tweet as well as a critical tweet by journalist Saagar Enjeti, who called Gadde Twitter\u2019s \u201ctop censorship advocate\u201d who \u201ccensored the Hunter Biden laptop story,\u201d prompted pro-Musk Twitter users to criticize her.<\/p>\n<p>Musk also implicitly criticized Gadde by calling Twitter\u2019s decision to block links to the New York Post\u2019s coverage of Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop \u201cobviously incredibly inappropriate.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The piece was banned by major social media sites in the weeks before the election, with Twitter justifying accusations of censorship by labeling the story \u201ccontent obtained through hacking that contains private information.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Many mainstream outlets also\u00a0tried to discredit the Post\u2019s article, before later\u00a0reporting on its veracity\u00a0long after President Joe Biden was elected.<\/p>\n<p>In response to the flood of online criticism directed at Gadde earlier this week, another top Twitter executive defended her and accused Musk of \u201cmisogyny.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>
