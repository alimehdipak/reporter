Instead, when they arrived in England\u2019s Lake District, they learned they were actually going to rough it in the wilderness.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey bamboozled me!\u201d said Deandra. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I got out of the van and saw that I was in the mountains, I could have cried. And then we had to pick limited items to bring \u2013 I had four suitcases, and I had to pick one. I was so sad [without] my makeup. I could be butt naked, and I would have been A-OK, but . . . I just take so much pride in looking a certain way. I know most people are like, \u2018Girl, that\u2019s not important.\u2019 But as long as my nose is contoured, I\u2019m OK.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Her breaking point on the show?
