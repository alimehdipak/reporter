He now serves as executive chairman. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere is too much management turnover,\u201d a private markets source said. <\/p>\n<p>A broader shakeout in the payments industry is also making investors jittery. Fast, another payments startup and Bolt rival that was backed by Stripe, suddenly shut down last week after failing to secure funding.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Breslow taunted Stripe over the Fast\u2019s failure on Twitter Friday, posting a meme and writing, \u201cStripe didn\u2019t put $100m into fast, they donated $100m to bolt marketing. Best thing that could happen.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Larger publicly traded payments companies have likewise seen their stocks tank this year after soaring in 2020 and 2021. <\/p>\n<p>Shopify shares soared as high as $1,750 in November 2021 before collapsing more than 50% to about $644 on Friday. PayPal shares, likewise, soared above $300 last summer before falling to about $113. <\/p>\n<p>And shares of Jack Dorsey\u2019s Square parent company Block traded above $275 in August but are now hovering around $125.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/bolt-25-copy.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" \/>Bolt was looking to raise money at a $14 billion valuation earlier this year, but is now worth around $6 billion, private market sources said.
