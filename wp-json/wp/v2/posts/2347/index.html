It is the largest and most powerful telescope ever made, and it will allow astronomers to study the universe in unprecedented detail. The telescope is named after NASA\u2019s second administrator, James E. Webb.<\/p>\n<p>Webb is a large, yet very lightweight telescope. It weighs in at around 6 tons. This gives it the unique ability to be launched into space without having to use any additional boosters or rockets, which makes it cheaper and more efficient to launch than larger telescopes that need extra fuel and assistance.<\/p>\n<p>The James Webb Space Telescope will be placed in an orbit near the Earth. This will allow it to be close enough to receive information quickly, but it will also keep it a safe distance from any objects that may damage or interfere with its operations.<\/p>\n<p>So what is this telescope capable of doing? Well, its primary mission is to study some of the most distant objects in the universe. It will also be able to take extremely high-resolution images of planets and stars. Additionally, Webb will be able to study the atmospheres of exoplanets, which are planets that orbit stars other than our own sun.<\/p>\n<h3> where is James Webb Space Telescope capable of doing?<\/h3>\n<p>The James Webb Space Telescope is capable of doing a lot. It can take very high-resolution images and spectra of astronomical objects, allowing astronomers to study them in great detail. Additionally, the telescope can also detect very faint objects that are otherwise too difficult to observe. In short, the James Webb Space Telescope is a powerful tool that will allow astronomers to learn more about the universe.<\/p>\n<h3>James Webb telescope vs Hubble:<\/h3>\n<p>There are many differences between the James Webb Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope, but one of the most notable is their size. The James Webb Telescope is much larger than the Hubble Space Telescope, and this gives it a number of advantages. For example, the James Webb Telescope can collect more light than the Hubble Space Telescope, which means that it can take better pictures. The James Webb Telescope is also able to see farther into space than the Hubble Space Telescope, which means that it can study objects that are too faint for the Hubble Space Telescope to see.<\/p>\n<p>Another difference between the two telescopes is their location. The James Webb Telescope will be located in orbit around the Earth, while the Hubble Space Telescope is located in orbit around the sun. This means that the James Webb Telescope will be able to take pictures of objects that are much closer to Earth than the Hubble Space Telescope.<\/p>\n<p>One final difference between the two telescopes is their cost. The James Webb Telescope is estimated to cost about $8 billion, while the Hubble Space Telescope cost about $5 billion when it was first built. Although the James Webb Telescope is more expensive than the Hubble Space Telescope, it has a number of advantages that make it worth the extra cost.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, there are many differences between the James Webb Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope. However, they both have unique capabilities that make them both valuable research tools for astronomers.
