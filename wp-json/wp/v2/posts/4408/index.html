I don&#8217;t think exemption is realistically possible. If that is possibility, I don&#8217;t know what exemption would be about.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t have much answers there.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Having won all three of the first majors in 2021, Djokovic&#8217;s bid for the elusive Calendar Grand Slam was spoiled by Daniil Medvedev in last year&#8217;s US Open final. He was then unable to play at the Australian Open to begin this year after being deported from the country.<\/p>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p>Currently Djokovic, 35, will not be able to play Down Under in 2023 either as he&#8217;s not eligible for a visa. He acknowledged he was unsure when he would next be able to play a competitive match during his victory news conference Sunday.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I am on vacation,&#8221; Djokovic said. &#8220;Whether or not I&#8217;m playing any tournament soon, I&#8217;ll definitely be resting for the next couple weeks because it has been quite an exhausting and demanding period for me the last few months. A lot of tennis, which I was very happy about. I got what I wanted here.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll wait hopefully for some good news from USA because I would really love to go there. That would be probably the next big tournament, the next big swing, playing a tournament or two before US Open and US Open. If that doesn&#8217;t happen, then I have to see what the schedule will look like.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Djokovic, who is currently ranked No. 3, will fall to No. 7 in the rankings Monday as Wimbledon was stripped of its ranking points this year as a result of the tournament&#8217;s ban on Russian and Belarusian players due to the ongoing invasion of Ukraine.<\/p>\n<p>Djokovic&#8217;s ranking will continue to fall if he is unable to defend his runner-up status in New York.
