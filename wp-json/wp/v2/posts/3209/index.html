The restaurant subsequently confiscated her ID and told her to come back the next day with a viable payment method, causing the customer to fly off the handle. <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u2018Don\u2019t you want to go on the boat and do some African-American fishing?\u2019<\/p>\n<p>One of the disturbing questions the woman asked Ian Soleimani on video<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\u201cIt was paid, though, ma\u2019am, and you rejected the payment,\u201d the sunglasses-sporting woman spluttered in the clip. Things heated up after she noticed Soleimani filming her, and proceeded to bombard him with racial comments.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me, sir. Hi, one of four black people in Santa Barbara,\u201d fumed the incensed restaurant customer. \u201cOh, now I\u2019m a racist, terrible person, sorry, just because you\u2019re an obnoxious guy. It\u2019s not your fault that you\u2019re black, of course.

Wtf. You handled this so well, Ian!\u201d Meanwhile, one commenter on Reddit wrote, \u201cWTF is African American fishing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cInsane but unfortunately not surprising,\u201d lamented one Instagram commenter, while another advised Soleimani to find \u201cthis Karen &amp; send this video to her work place.\u201d Interestingly, while the bozo\u2019s identity has yet to be confirmed, a Reddit user claimed that the restaurant manager\u2019s husband told them she was actually named Karen and hails from Florida. <\/p>\n<p>Many were shocked that such a racist incident could occur in progressive Santa Barbara. \u201cWhat the hell?! NOT SB\u2026 no way,\u201d said one flabbergasted poster. <\/p>\n<p>However, Soleimani claims this is not an isolated incident. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cPeople have been kicked out of boathouse a few times for [racially] motivated comments towards myself, unfortunately,\u201d the DJ told the Daily Dot. \u201cLived here since 2003 and this happens all the time.
