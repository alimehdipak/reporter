Because even though they upended the entire business model of Hollywood, they still get no respect. It wouldn\u2019t just be a win for the film, it would be a badge of acceptance from the industry. <\/p>\n<p>If Ted Sarandos and Co. do take the stage at the Dolby Theater, they\u2019ll surely belt that famous \u201cCabaret\u201d lyric sung by Sally Bowles: \u201cNot a loser anymore \u2014 like the last time and the time before!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And the time before that.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Remember \u201cRoma\u201d? Alfonso Cuaron\u2019s 2018 semi-autobiographical movie was a critic\u2019s darling for the streamer. The Spanish-language, black-and-white film was heavily favored to win the top prize and seemed a shoo-in after Cuaron took home the telling Best Director trophy. Social media pariah \u201cGreen Book\u201d was called to the podium instead.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2019\/02\/roma.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" \/>\u201cRoma\u201d was sent packing by \u201cGreen Book.\u201d \u00a9Netflix\/Courtesy Everett Collection   \t \t   <\/p>\n<p>Netflix \u2014 believing itself to be the new King of the Movies \u2014 doubled down. The next year they produced the massively expensive film \u201cThe Irishman\u201d ($159 million) and released it in November. If you ask Siri, \u201cWhat do I need to make an Oscar-winning film?,\u201d she\u2019d say, \u201cMartin Scorsese, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and a mafia plot.\u201d It was nominated for 10 Oscars, including Best Picture, and lost every single one.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Did \u201cMarriage Story,\u201d Netflix\u2019s smaller but still prestigious 2019 movie about a crumbling relationship starring Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver, walk down the aisle? Nope! That lost Best Picture, too.<\/p>\n<p>Even Aaron Sorkin couldn\u2019t change their fate. During the first year of the pandemic, when almost no one went to a movie theater for months, Netflix\u2019s \u201cTrial of the Chicago 7\u201d still lost to \u201cNomadland,\u201d which played exclusively in the two brick-and-mortar theaters that were open.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2020\/10\/trial-of-chicago-7-5.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" \/>Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Trial of the Chicago 7\u201d was nominated for Best Picture, but lost to \u201cNomadland.\u201d Netflix    <\/p>\n<p>Now comes \u201cThe Power of the Dog.\u201d More boring than a train delay, it has all the right pieces: It\u2019s a Western; Campion would be one of just three women to ever win Best Director; its stars Benedict Cumberbatch and Kirsten Dunst are both having a moment; the film is kind of homoerotic (just ask Sam Elliott!).<\/p>\n<p>However, although it\u2019s won a slew of awards so far, it failed to even get nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Ensemble, and Cumberbatch, Dunst and Kodi Smit-McPhee all went home empty-handed there, too. You hear that angry barking in the distance? That\u2019s because Netflix knows that the majority of Oscar voters are actors.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/Jane-Campion-57.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"THE POWER OF THE DOG, from left: Kodi Smit-McPhee, Benedict Cumberbatch, 2021. ph: Kirsty Griffin \/\u00a9 Netflix \/Courtesy Everett Collection\" \/>\u201cThe Power of the Dog\u201d is Netflix\u2019s best hope so far to win the Best Picture Oscar. \u00a9Netflix\/Courtesy Everett Collection    <\/p>\n<p>The film also will also be faced with the new-ish ranked-choice voting system, just like New York uses in our mayoral elections. That method of tabulating the winner, considered to be more fair, boosts the chances of \u201cBelfast\u201d or Apple TV\u2019s \u201cCODA\u201d (the big SAG winner), because if one film doesn\u2019t get more than 50 percent of the No. 1 slot votes, the No. 2 slot votes get factored in.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m no mathematician, but I reckon that doesn\u2019t benefit a movie as divisive as \u201cPower of the Dog.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>So, Netflix could break its Oscars curse next Sunday.
