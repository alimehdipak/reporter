Her late maternal grandmother was a force in the kitchen, and Biegel came of age cooking at her feet. She studied journalism and food science at Miami University in Ohio, graduating in 2003. That same year, she was visiting New York City for the weekend and met Billy Joel at the rooftop bar at the Peninsula Hotel. The two wed in 2004 and amicably split five years later.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps inspired by the experience, her best-selling 2011 novel \u201cGroundswell\u201d tells the story of a young New York screenwriter recovering from divorce, who finds healing (and new romance) during a surf trip to Mexico.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/alexa-katie-lee-5.jpg?w=683\" alt=\"Katie Lee Biegel in a button down shirt. \" \/>Button-down shirt, $1,695, and skirt, $1,595, both at Amir Taghi; TWO by London earrings in 14-k yellow gold with diamonds, $16,060; London Collection necklace in 18-k yellow gold with diamonds, $42,780, dome ring (Biegel\u2019s left hand) in 18-k yellow gold with diamonds, $11,990, and twist ring (right hand) in 14-k yellow gold with diamonds, $6,270; Chanel Coco Crush cuff in 18-k yellow gold, price upon requestMelanie Acevedo    <\/p>\n<p>The Hallmark Channel just announced it\u2019s adapting that novel as a movie, with Biegel signed on to executive produce and make an on-screen cameo. It\u2019s set to premiere on the network later this year. (No word yet on who will play the heroine\u2019s hunky surfer love interest.)<\/p>\n<p>As for Biegel\u2019s own Hollywood ending? In 2015, she met and started dating Ryan Biegel, a producer on her show, \u201cBeach Bites With Katie Lee,\u201d currently airing on the Cooking Channel.<\/p>\n<p>They married in 2018 on Italy\u2019s Amalfi coast, celebrating at one of their favorite places \u2014 Lo Scoglio, the restaurant famous for its zucchini pasta.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/alexa-katie-lee-2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Katie Lee Biegel in blue. \" \/>Top, $14,000 at Valentino, 821 Madison Ave.; London Collection earrings in 18-k white and yellow gold with white and yellow diamonds, $35,000, and ring in 18-k white gold with diamonds and sapphires, $10,900Melanie Acevedo    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a great cook. He\u2019s really into food, too. So that\u2019s how we bonded,\u201d Biegel says. \u201cI really enjoy having someone as into food as I am. It\u2019s such a huge part of my life \u2026 Usually when we say, \u2018What do you want to do this weekend?\u2019 it\u2019s not necessarily an activity. It\u2019s more, \u2018What do you want to eat?\u2019 \u201d<\/p>\n<p>On a recent weekend, the answer was trying the new location of the Lobster Roll (affectionally known as \u201cLunch\u201d) in Southampton, which she mused would be kid-friendly.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIris loves going out. She loves looking at everybody and watching people,\u201d reports the proud mom. \u201cAnd she eats better in a restaurant, I think because she\u2019s excited.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Even though Biegel is a professional, feeding a fussy tot has been challenging.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/alexa-katie-lee-4.jpg?w=683\" alt=\"Katie lee Biegel in a feather dress.\" \/>Feather dress, similar styles price upon request at Prabal Gurung; London Collection earrings in platinum with diamonds, $597,600, necklace (top) in 14-k yellow gold with rainbow sapphires, $2,970, necklace in platinum with pink sapphire pendant, $129,000, ring (middle finger, bottom) in 18-k rose gold with rainbow sapphires, $8,205, and ring (ring finger) in 18-k rose gold with pink and blue sapphires, $8,140; GiGi Ferranti Portofino \u201cWave\u201d ring (middle finger, top) in 18-k yellow gold with gemstones, $2,850Melanie Acevedo    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cShe basically has three food groups: carbs, fruit and marinara,\u201d she jokes, readily admitting that the marinara in question typically comes in a jar with a Rao\u2019s label on it.<\/p>\n<p>While Biegel\u2019s approach to food and entertaining has always been unfussy, motherhood has forced her to simplify things even further.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been really into sheet-pan suppers,\u201d she says. A recent favorite has been sheet-pan fajitas, where the protein, peppers and onions all cook together on a single pan in the oven. \u201cI like things that are easy and fast right now. And not a lot of ingredients and certainly not a lot of clean-up.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Finding time for herself has been a challenge, but she recognizes the need to do so.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cShe basically has three food groups: carbs, fruit and marinara.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Biegel on cooking for her 19-month-old daughter, Iris<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\u201cUp until a few weeks ago, I felt like brushing my teeth was self-care,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I see people talking about, \u2018Oh I have a bath ritual for my self-care,\u2019 I laugh.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She\u2019s recently found more time to exercise, even if it\u2019s for shorter bursts than she\u2019s used to.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBefore I had a baby, I would exercise an hour and a half a day,\u201d she says. \u201cBut now just setting aside 25 to 30 minutes has made me a more sane person. It\u2019s helping me a lot.\u201d Her current favorites include online yoga classes on the Ob\u00e9 Fitness app and the SoulCycle At-Home Bike.<\/p>\n<p>Like her food, Biegel\u2019s personal style is all about easy elegance. Her taste in those beloved sweats runs the gamut from Target to more upscale brands such as Aviator Nation and Monrow. But summer is far and away her favorite fashion season.<br \/>\u201cYou can get by with wearing comfortable clothes that still look nice,\u201d she enthuses. \u201cYou can just put on a little sundress or something, and it looks good.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/alexa-katie-lee-3.jpg?w=683\" alt=\"Katie Lee Biegel in a white gown. \" width=\"618\" height=\"926\" \/>\u201cFloral Evermore\u201d gown, $819, and \u201cFloral Evermore\u201d cape, $529, both at Needle &amp; Thread; Chanel Eternal N\u00b05 transformable earrings in 18-k white gold with diamonds, $10,500, and Eternal N\u00b05 ring in 18-k white gold with diamonds, $7,900; TWO by London necklace in 14-k white gold with diamonds, $17,490Melanie Acevedo    <\/p>\n<p>Her favorite labels include Ulla Johnson, Xirena, and Stella McCartney \u2014 but only if she\u2019s feeling fancy. As for our Alexa cover shoot, the white Amir Taghi look was her favorite. \u201cI like simple and classic looks, and I loved that chunky gold Chanel bracelet.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And when it comes to styling Iris, the chef keeps it simple. \u201cShe dresses like me. She\u2019s in sweats every day,\u201d Biegel says with a giggle.<\/p>\n<p>She takes a similarly understated approach with her own jewelry. Most days, you\u2019ll find her in a classic pair of diamond earrings from London Jewelers. \u201cI\u2019ve known the London Jewelers family forever, almost 20 years now,\u201d she says of the bijoux boutique, which has locations across Long Island and in Manhattan and New Jersey. \u201cI always enjoy going in there to talk \u2014 and they also love food.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/katie-lee-biegelclose-up.jpg?w=682\" alt=\"Katie Lee Biegel - Photo by Melanie Acevedo.\" \/>Bolero jacket, $8,995 at Markarian; Van Cleef &amp; Arpels Frivole earrings in 18-k yellow gold with diamonds, $7,550, and ring in 18-k yellow gold with diamonds, $22,200Melanie Acevedo    <\/p>\n<p>After her engagement, she nabbed a simple white-gold wedding band for Ryan there. Her own wedding band was a vintage white-gold piece that complemented her engagement ring, a 1920s sparkler with a cushion-cut diamond.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI really love vintage jewelry,\u201d says Biegel, who borrowed a pair of Victorian earrings for her wedding day.<\/p>\n<p>The passion for baubles extends to her TV watching. She just finished \u201cThe Gilded Age\u201d on HBO and gushes about the accessorizing on the series. \u201cIt was one of my favorite things about the show: They had great jewelry.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But while the Biegel brand celebrates a certain sort of relaxed good life in the Hamptons, Biegel herself is attuned to the struggles of others. She\u2019s long been involved with Food Bank for New York City and serves on its board. In 2016, after learning that many women visit food banks for personal care products, she launched the Woman to Woman project within the organization. It works to supply hygiene essentials to girls and women in need.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA lot of young women miss school because they don\u2019t have access to period products,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible to think about somebody not having access to that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Looking ahead, Biegel is focused on her Hallmark debut as well as a new children\u2019s book. But she says she has no plans to write any sort of kiddie cookbook.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that anybody can tell each other what their kids are gonna like,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re so fickle.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>You can, however, count on her for easy summer entertaining. She can\u2019t wait for the juicy tomatoes, cobbler made from August peaches and delicious family-style meals \u2014 ribs, flank steak, a whole side of salmon \u2014 that the season will bring.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI live for summer,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m still like a kid who\u2019s on the school calendar waiting for Memorial Day.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>Editor: Serena French; Stylist: Anahita Moussavian; Photo Editor: Jessica Hober; Fashion Assistants: Sean Rodriguez, Madeleine Shepherd; Hair: Naoko Suzuki for Rossano Ferretti Hairspa using Rossano Ferretti Parma; Makeup: Julie Tussey for Matono Salon using Revlon<\/em>; <em>All jewelry available at London Jewelers, 2046 Northern Blvd., Manhasset, LI<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>New York Post may be compensated and\/or receive an affiliate commission if you buy through our links.
