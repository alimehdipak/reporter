He also discovers that larger forces are at play and are working against him, endangering his loved ones.

Chris, Constance Wu, Taylor Kitsch \u2026 it just goes on,\u201d said Pardo. \u201cI really wanted to be part of that, because it\u2019s inspiring to work with that kind of talent. We had a lot of fun on that set.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Pardo said that he was familiar with the world of Navy SEALs as seen on the series, thanks to his own family background.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy father was in the LAPD for 30 years and in the Marines for 30 years. So, I grew up in that atmosphere, around a lot of those guys,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat was interesting for me is that Tony Layun being an FBI agent \u2014 there\u2019s a moment where he gets pulled into Reece\u2019s world. And there has to be this feeling of he\u2019s a fish out of water, because the consequences are life or death. I just kept this idea in my head that Tony was this normal average man who was trying to catch Superman.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/the-terminal-list-chris-pratt-4.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Chris Pratt in a Navy SEAL uniform at a funeral. \" \/>Chris Pratt as James Reece in \u201cThe Terminal List.\u201d Justin Lubin    <\/p>\n<p>As events spiral out of control and the media portrays Reece as a dangerous man, Tony becomes embroiled in a cat-and-mouse game with him. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone talks about how you can\u2019t catch him, [how] he\u2019s escaping every situation. And here\u2019s Tony, who is sort of outmatched with somebody like James Reese,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, he has the power of belief. He feels like he can catch him.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>        <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/mayans-mc-jd-pardo-3.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"JD Pardo looks serious in biker leathers. \" \/>JD Pardo in \u201cMayans MC.\u201d     <\/p>\n<p>Some of Pardo\u2019s colleagues on set were real Navy SEALs, which pushed him to work harder, he said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m always up for a challenge. With \u2018Mayans,\u2019 I didn\u2019t know how to ride a bike, so I had to go to Harley school and throw myself into that world. In the same way with \u2018The Terminal List,\u2019 I had to throw myself into this world of ex-Navy SEALs who were playing these characters,\u201d he said. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cJust being around them as a group \u2026 when they say \u2018action,\u2019 those guys don\u2019t have stunt men. We have stunt men come in and do scenes that they had to do, but the majority of the time, our guys are doing it. And so my playing the character Tony, who is the head of this task force \u2014 psychologically, I didn\u2019t want these guys to do something that I couldn\u2019t do. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo I challenged myself every day.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cMayans MC\u201d star JD Pardo, who plays outlaw biker EZ Reyes in the \u201cSons of Anarchy\u201d spinoff, tackles a completely different role in \u201cThe Terminal List,\u201d a new Prime Video thriller starring&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":4077,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[5],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4076"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/6"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4076"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4076\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":6289,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4076\/revisions\/6289"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4076"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4076"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4076"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
