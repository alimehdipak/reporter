(Future New York also appeared in Season 3, but Season 4 picks up a few years later.)\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s not much orientation into this new world, since the series simply throws the audience into the middle of several characters\u2019 stories \u2014 and it\u2019s up to us to make sense of where they are now.<\/p>\n<p>Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood) is living her life as a meek woman named Christina with a friendly roommate, Maya (Ariana DeBose, \u201cWest Side Story\u201c). Christina doesn\u2019t seem to remember her identity or her previous life, and she spends her days scripting stories for an entertainment company about background characters in video games. <\/p>\n<p>She wants to write about romance, but she\u2019s told that she needs to give her characters more violent ends. She\u2019s also getting strange phone calls from a man who seems to think she\u2019s controlling his life, and she wakes up every morning in the same position (which is a callback to the \u201cloop\u201d she was on in past seasons, at the park).<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/ariana-debose-evan-rachel-wood.jpg?w=1024\" \/>Ariana DeBose and Evan Rachel Wood in \u201cWestworld\u201d Season 4.

John Johnson\/HBO    <\/p>\n<p>So, it seems likely that she\u2019s living in another loop right now, with the winking bit of irony that she\u2019s now in the position of the writer instead of a background character herself, albeit without realizing it. Of course, this begs the questions: who is controlling her loop? (if she\u2019s in one), why is she in it? and who else around her is a robot?<\/p>\n<p>Other plotlines set up similar cryptic scenarios that leave us with more questions than answers. William, aka The Man in Black (Ed Harris), is still violently wreaking havoc, with a nefarious yet vague end goal. Charlotte (Tessa Thompson) is still scheming and there are lots of symbolic images including flies and mazes. Mave (Thandiwe Newton) and Caleb (Aaron Paul) team up on a mission \u2014 but Caleb (a Season 3 addition) also now has a family with a wife and daughter, while Mave has been living a survivalist lifestyle alone in a remote cabin. <\/p>\n<p>Bernard (Jeffrey Wright) is back, and so is Teddy Flood (James Marsden), Dolores\u2019 stalwart cowboy love. He died in Season 2 and wasn\u2019t in Season 3, but when you\u2019re a robot, apparently death isn\u2019t permanent.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/aaron-paul.jpg?w=1024\" \/>Aaron Paul as Caleb in \u201cWestworld\u201d Season 4.

John Johnson\/HBO    <\/p>\n<p>In typical \u201cWestworld\u201d fashion, it\u2019s not quite clear where this is all going, or what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s all interesting, though.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>At its best, this show is thrilling, thoughtful and intriguing, blending an addictive plot with philosophical undertones. At its worst, it\u2019s smugly self-serious, ponderous and seems to believe that being convoluted is akin to being smart. While Seasons 2 and 3 fell victim to the latter, so far, Season 4 intrigues. Yes, it\u2019s confusing, but there are enough pieces of information for us to begin making sense of the storyline as it unfolds and leave us wanting more.<\/p>\n<p>This feels like a return to form for \u201cWestworld\u201d and also feels new with the futuristic New York City setting and its characters in different narratives.<\/p>\n<p>Even if you were frustrated with Season 3, this new ride is worth checking out.\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Doesn\u2019t look like anything to me.\u00a0 HBO\u2019s robot sci-fi hit \u201cWestworld\u201d is back for Season 4 after a two-year break (Season 3 aired in the spring of 2020).\u00a0 Season 4 (premiering Sunday,&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":4083,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[5],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4082"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/6"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4082"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4082\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4082"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4082"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4082"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
