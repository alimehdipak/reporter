Sources have told ESPN that Barcelona made a third offer for Lewandowski last week, worth more than \u20ac40m. Kahn has publicly insisted that the Poland striker is not for sale.<\/p>\n<p>United similarly insist that Ronaldo, who scored 24 goals last season, is not available for transfer and that new manager Erik ten Hag &#8220;wants and expects&#8221; him to be part of the squad next season.

The 21-year-old winger has been linked with both Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United, but after Frank Lampard&#8217;s side transferred Richarlison to Tottenham, the latest indicates that the Toffees are keen to keep hold of Gordon.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Manchester United&#8217;s first proposal of \u00a351m for Antony has been turned down by Ajax, reveals Goal.
