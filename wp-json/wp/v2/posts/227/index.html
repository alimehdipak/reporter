But make no mistake: The 2022 NFL free-agent class is still loaded with talent and big names who could land huge-money deals. How will it all play out? Who will sign where, and for how much? We mocked how offers and deals might go down for six of the top players available at multiple positions.<\/p>\n<p>Our NFL Nation reporters served as GMs for their teams and made contract offers for key free agents while trying to stay within that team&#8217;s salary-cap restraints and realm of realistic outcomes. The object wasn&#8217;t to &#8220;win&#8221; but rather to accurately reflect how a team might approach negotiations. For instance, the cap-strapped Packers didn&#8217;t throw around any offers here, but the Dolphins and Jaguars had money to spend &#8212; and it showed. Once the offers were all in, national NFL reporter Dan Graziano played the role of player rep, mulled the proposals and &#8220;signed&#8221; each of the playmakers to a new deal.<\/p>\n<p>So who is headed to a new team, and who re-signed for another go with his current franchise? Who earned the big bucks? Let&#8217;s predict this offseason&#8217;s free agency, which officially opens on March 16 after a two-day negotiating window, for six stars on the open market: Allen Robinson II, J.C. Jackson, Terron Armstead, Von Miller, Tyrann Mathieu and Chandler Jones.

But their offer is just a lot better than the others. Earning $20.5 million per year in Florida goes a lot further than $18 million per year in New Jersey, and I like those roster bonuses in 2023 and 2024 as a way of keeping the team honest. Trevor Lawrence looks like he could be something. New coach Doug Pederson has a Super Bowl ring. Looks like I&#8217;m going back to where it all began. <em>&#8212; Dan Graziano<\/em><\/p>\n<p>How he fits: Did I overpay? Probably, but I got a player who has 40 career touchdown catches and has averaged 12.9 yards per catch on 495 receptions from a less-than-underwhelming group of QBs. We&#8217;re talking about Chad Henne, Blake Bortles, Mitchell Trubisky, Chase Daniel, Nick Foles, Andy Dalton and Justin Fields. Trevor Lawrence would be the best QB he has played with in his career. Robinson isn&#8217;t a burner, but he&#8217;s a big, athletic receiver who can go up and get the ball &#8212; something the Jaguars don&#8217;t have right now. He&#8217;d be a huge threat in the red zone, too, which is something the Jaguars desperately need because they threw a league-low seven TD passes in that area in 2021. Pairing Robinson with Marvin Jones Jr., Jamal Agnew, tight end Dan Arnold, running backs Travis Etienne Jr. and James Robinson and a couple rookies from a very good receiver class gives Lawrence a significantly upgraded group of pass-catchers. <em>&#8212; Michael DiRocco<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/i\/infographics\/20170710_nfl_fpr\/charts\/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\" \/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/headshots\/nfl\/players\/full\/3121649.png&amp;w=43&amp;h=60&amp;scale=crop&amp;background=0xcccccc&amp;transparent=false\" \/><\/p>\n<p><b>2021 team:<\/b> Patriots | <b>Free-agent rank:<\/b> 13<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nfl\/500\/lac.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Chargers&#8217; offer: Three years, $35 million ($22M guaranteed) &#8230; This might be a little under-market, and while we have some cap space, we want to build something &#8212; and we have a lot of needs.

The Pats had their chance, and the Chargers aren&#8217;t really in the ballpark here. The other three are pretty similar, but I&#8217;m taking the Vikings out of it because Las Vegas and Pittsburgh are just offering a lot more in terms of guarantees. The Raiders&#8217; and Steelers&#8217; offers are close, and man &#8230; two all-time classic franchises. Great history of defense. Great uniforms. Really tough choice. The income tax thing is real, though, and that &#8212; plus the familiarity with the folks running the show in Vegas &#8212; breaks the tie. I&#8217;m taking the Raiders&#8217; offer here, though I might go back to the Steelers one more time to see if they&#8217;re willing to top it. <em>&#8212; Dan Graziano<\/em><\/p>\n<p>How he fits: Right away, Jackson &#8212; with his eight interceptions and league-leading 23 passes defensed last season &#8212; would solidify a secondary that will have a different look under new defensive coordinator Patrick Graham, departing from the Cover 3 sensibilities that Gus Bradley ran last season. The Raiders have already cleared cap space by re-structuring left tackle Kolton Miller and running back Kenyan Drake, and deciding to cut linebacker Cory Littleton &#8212; and they could free up more money by releasing the likes of defensive end Carl Nassib and linebacker and Nick Kwiatkoski. But Jackson would be CB1, and while Las Vegas hopes that Trayvon Mullen bounces back from an injury-plagued 2021 that limited him to just five games, the Raiders could still target another cornerback in the draft. <em>&#8212; Paul Gutierrez<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/i\/infographics\/20170710_nfl_fpr\/charts\/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\" \/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/headshots\/nfl\/players\/full\/15821.png&amp;w=43&amp;h=60&amp;scale=crop&amp;background=0xcccccc&amp;transparent=false\" \/><\/p>\n<p><b>2021 team:<\/b> Saints | <b>Free-agent rank:<\/b> 1<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nfl\/500\/chi.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Bears&#8217; offer: Three years, $58 million ($26M guaranteed and a $13M signing bonus, plus a $1M escalator for 80% of offensive snaps in 2022) &#8230; Come &#8220;home,&#8221; Terron.

The team&#8217;s offseason would be off to a good start by re-signing him. <em>&#8212; Adam Teicher<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/i\/infographics\/20170710_nfl_fpr\/charts\/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\" \/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/headshots\/nfl\/players\/full\/14927.png&amp;w=43&amp;h=60&amp;scale=crop&amp;background=0xcccccc&amp;transparent=false\" \/><\/p>\n<p><b>2021 team:<\/b> Cardinals | <b>Free-agent rank:<\/b> 10<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nfl\/500\/den.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Broncos&#8217; offer: Two years, $34 million ($24M guaranteed, with a $500,000 workout bonus each year and incentives of $1.5M for 11 sacks and $1.5M for 14 sacks each year) &#8230; Two words for you, Chandler: Russell Wilson. <em>&#8212; Jeff Legwold<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img data-src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2021\/1213\/nfl_mcshay-mock-draft_16x9_608x342.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2021\/1213\/nfl_mcshay-mock-draft_16x9_608x342.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Rankings:<\/b> Kiper \u00bb | McShay \u00bb<br \/>\u2022 <b>Mocks:<\/b> Kiper \u00bb | McShay \u00bb | Reid \u00bb<br \/>\u2022 Meet the QBs \u00bb | Intriguing teams \u00bb<br \/>\u2022 Draft order \u00bb | First Draft podcast \u00bb<br \/>\u2022 <b>More coverage \u00bb | Full rankings \u00bb<\/b><\/p>\n<p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nfl\/500\/sea.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Seahawks&#8217; offer: Two years, $30 million ($18M guaranteed, plus $1M in per-game roster bonuses each season and $2M incentives each season tied to playing time, sacks and the Pro Bowl) &#8230; Come play in a loud stadium and in an attacking defense that will make you its featured pass-rusher.

If these are the choices, then I might sit out a while and see if the landscape changes, a la Jadeveon Clowney from a couple of years back. I know my worth, and I&#8217;ve made plenty of money. I can wait until someone comes up. But if this is the market, I&#8217;m going back to the Broncos and saying, &#8220;Sure, I&#8217;ll take the $24 million guaranteed, but I want the deal to void after one year so I can pocket my $24 million and hit the market again after I go out there and post my eighth double-digit sack season.&#8221; You hear that? Eight! <em>&#8212; Dan Graziano<\/em><\/p>\n<p>How he fits: The Broncos have lived this life before, and it worked out for all involved. A 32-year-old DeMarcus Ware signed with the Broncos in 2014 in large part because Peyton Manning was at quarterback. Jones gives the Broncos the edge presence they need alongside Bradley Chubb. And newly hired defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero, who just won a Super Bowl ring, has promised to pressure opposing quarterbacks as much as possible, so Jones will be set loose to earn every incentive in the deal. <em>&#8212; Jeff Legwold<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mar 11, 2022NFL NationDan GrazianoCloseESPN Staff WriterJoined ESPN in 2011 New Jersey native and author of two published novelsEight NFL players received the franchise tag this week, and another two of the top presumed-free agents signed extensions.
