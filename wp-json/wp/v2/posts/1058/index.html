The belief from oddsmakers, however, is that the AFC has more depth.<\/p>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p>Chris Bennett, who oversees NFL odds for the Las Vegas-based Circa Sports, calculated the implied probabilities reflected by his sportsbook&#8217;s Super Bowl odds and found the AFC has roughly a 4% edge over the NFC.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a perfect science, because you would presume a really good team is going to come out of the NFC still, and not necessarily be a giant underdog to whatever team comes out of the AFC,&#8221; Bennett said. &#8220;But, overall, I think most people would agree that the AFC has better teams.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Even with all the improvements that AFC teams have made, and a lot of expense at NFC teams, I don&#8217;t want to go to crazy and give out too high of odds on NFC teams,&#8221; Bennett added.<\/p>\n<p>Circa Sports has the Buccaneers as 7-1 favorites to win the Super Bowl largely because of a &#8220;decent-sized bet&#8221; that Bennett said was placed on Tampa Bay to win the NFC. The Bills are 15-2, followed the Rams at 17-2, the Chiefs at 19-2 and the Packers at 10-1.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t necessarily think they&#8217;re better than the Bills,&#8221; Bennett said. &#8220;But the Bills are in the AFC, so they&#8217;ve got a tougher road. The Bucs, in particular in their division [NFC South], which isn&#8217;t looking very strong, have a much easier path than the Bills &#8212; even though, I might think the Bills would be favored over the Bucs on a neutral site.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The early Super Bowl line also shows oddsmakers giving a small edge to the AFC over the NFC. The AFC is a 1.5-point favorite in the early Super Bowl line at the SuperBook. The total is 52.5.<\/p>\n<p>While the teams at the top of oddsboards are evenly distributed between the conferences, seven of the 10 teams with the longest Super Bowl odds are from the NFC at Caesars Sportsbook. Entering last season, the AFC had four of the five teams with the longest odds, including the eventual conference champion Cincinnati Bengals, who were 125-1.<\/p>\n<p><img data-src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2020\/1012\/r759648_1296x729_16-9.png\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2020\/1012\/r759648_1296x729_16-9.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>A daily sports betting news and information show (6-7 p.m. ET, ESPN2) that aims to better serve the millions of sports fans who participate in sports wagering and help educate general sports fans with in-depth analysis. <b>Watch \u00bb<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Here is a look at some of the NFL odds and how they&#8217;ve moved over the last two months:<\/p>\n<p>Super Bowl odds-movement [per Caesars Sportsbook, which opened its odds to win Super Bowl LVII on Jan. 30).<\/p>\n<p>Improved odds<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Los Angeles Chargers &#8212; Opening: 22-1 Current: 16-1<br \/>\u2022 Tampa Bay Buccaneers &#8212; Opening: 14-1 Current: 8-1<br \/>\u2022 Denver Broncos &#8212; Opening: 25-1 Current: 16-1<br \/>\u2022 Cleveland Browns &#8212; Opening: 40-1 Current: 18-1<br \/>\u2022 Green Bay Packers &#8212; Opening: 15-1 Current 11-1<\/p>\n<p>Decreased odds<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 New England Patriots &#8212; Opening: 22-1, Current: 40-1<br \/>\u2022 Cincinnati Bengals &#8212; Opening: 12-1, Current: 22-1<br \/>\u2022 Seattle Seahawks &#8212; Opening: 40-1, Current: 80-1<br \/>\u2022 Kansas City Chiefs &#8212; Opening: 13-2, Current: 9-1<br \/>\u2022 Philadelphia Eagles &#8212; Opening: 30-1, Current 50-1<br \/>\u2022 Atlanta Falcons &#8212; Opening: 60-1, Current: 100-1<\/p>\n<p>Division drama<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 The Chiefs remain the favorite to win the AFC West but their odds have decreased notably after trading Tyreek Hill to Miami and seeing division rivals Denver and Las Vegas add big-name stars in Russell Wilson and Davante Adams respectively.<\/p>\n<p>To begin March, the Chiefs were -175 odds-on favorites to win the AFC West.
