Much like with real property, owners splash out in the hopes they\u2019ll be worth more in future.<\/p>\n<p>However, just like their real-world counterparts, the value of the plots can go up or down. They are considered a risky investment.<\/p>\n<p>Cheryl wrote: \u201cFor me, digital real estate and the metaverse will be playing a major role in how humans communicate, transact, and interact.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs such, buying digital real estate in the metaverse is like putting your stake into the next wave of technology, commercialism, and ways of socializing.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt is pretty much like buying real estate in a country. Just that this country is a digital one, and people are not really living inside it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The mysterious investor claims to have spent $19,000 SGD ($14,000) on a plot of land in the Decentraland metaverse.<\/p>\n<p>They say they hope to in future rent it out to businesses or place advertising on it to make a bit of extra cash on the side.<\/p>\n<p>After walking readers through the process of buying their own Decentraland property, the investor gave a word of warning.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI have to remind you guys to ensure the authenticity of your purchase \u2013 scammers are everywhere, so beware.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Like any investment, there\u2019s also the risk that it will LOSE value.<\/p>\n<p>It may have experienced something of a boom, but following months of rising prices, metaverse property prices appear to be\u00a0taking a tumble.<\/p>\n<p>According to analytics company Meta Metrics, the average price of metaverse property dropped 18 percent in March.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s in stark contrast to the preceding six months when prices rose nine-fold. Sales in January topped $85million.<\/p>\n<p>However, despite the dip, things are still looking rosy for investors.<\/p>\n<p>Land pricing was still four times higher in March than it was a year earlier when properties were going for $2,131 on average.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s unlikely that the blip will curb sales as interest in the industry grows.<\/p>\n<p>Sales of virtual real estate topped $500million last year and could double this year, according to analysts and investors.<\/p>\n<p>So far, metaverse real estate sales have been concentrated on the \u201cBig Four\u201d \u2013 Sandbox, Decentraland, Cryptovoxels and Somnium.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s likely that other sales booms will sweep the industry in future as new metaverses become the flavors of the week.<\/p>\n<p><em>This article originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission. <\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A gung-ho investor claims to have dropped thousands of dollars on a plot of virtual land.
