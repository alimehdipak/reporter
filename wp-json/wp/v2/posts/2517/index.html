It&#8217;s time to do the same for the postseason.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the playoff edition of ESPN NHL Rank, which seeks to identify the top forwards, defensemen and goaltenders in the upcoming Stanley Cup playoffs. Dozens of voters participated, choosing one winner in a series of head-to-head voting matchups created from the players on the 16 postseason qualifiers.<\/p>\n<p>The following list features NHL award winners, previous Stanley Cup champions and stars that are seeking postseason glory.

His 60-goal season was the first in the NHL since Steven Stamkos&#8217; in 2011-12, and the first ever for an American-born player. He set a new Maple Leafs record for single-season goals &#8212; no small feat for a franchise that entered the league in 1917. His growth as a defensive center has made him one of the most potent total packages the NHL has seen in recent memory.<\/p>\n<p>Matthews has 17 points in his last 19 playoff games, atoning for an invisible performance in 2018 that still defines him. That&#8217;s because Matthews has yet to carry the Leafs to a playoff series victory.

No defenseman has a higher points-per-game average than Makar in the last three seasons (1.01). But assume the Avalanche defenseman is one-dimensional at your own risk. Makar is a well-above-average defender despite drawing the toughest assignments for the Avalanche.<\/p>\n<p>He&#8217;s been a consistent playoff performer, with 31 points in 35 career games, with 12 on the power play and 19 at even strength.

Attempts to take the puck from him are bound to fail.<\/p>\n<p>But having taken his cues from friend and mentor Sidney Crosby, MacKinnon has worked hard to develop the defensive part of his game through the years. He&#8217;s never played in a championship playoff round, but it&#8217;s not for lack of trying: MacKinnon has 69 points in 50 career playoff games.<em> &#8212; Wyshynski<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/headshots\/nhl\/players\/full\/3041970.png&amp;w=43&amp;h=60&amp;scale=crop&amp;background=0xcccccc&amp;transparent=false\" \/><\/p>\n<p>2021-22 stats: 39 G | 49 A | 88 PTS<br \/>Preseason rank: 4<\/p>\n<p>No less an authority than ESPN&#8217;s John Tortorella believes Barkov is the superior player to Connor McDavid, and perhaps the best player in the entire NHL. Few players can boast the kind of two-way play that the Panthers center possesses, with 304 points since 2018-19 (12th in the NHL) and last season&#8217;s Selke Trophy as the best defensive forward in the league.<\/p>\n<p>Barkov has won faceoffs and put up points (14 in 16 games) during his NHL playoff career, but he&#8217;s also skated to a minus-10, which is uncharacteristic for a player that&#8217;s been a regular-season minus just once since 2015-16.<em> &#8212; Wyshynski<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/headshots\/nhl\/players\/full\/3895074.png&amp;w=43&amp;h=60&amp;scale=crop&amp;background=0xcccccc&amp;transparent=false\" \/><\/p>\n<p>2021-22 stats: 44 G | 79 A | 123 PTS<br \/>Preseason rank: 1<\/p>\n<p>The greatest evidence that McDavid is a gamebreaker comes from his peers. In the NHLPA&#8217;s recent Players Poll, McDavid was the overwhelming choice (42.4%) for the skater that most players would want on their team if they needed a victory. Considering how many games McDavid has won seemingly on his own in Edmonton, you can understand why.<\/p>\n<p>The 25-year-old center won his fourth scoring title this season with a career-best 123 points, including 44 goals. The Oilers will need that kind of production to win in the playoffs, where McDavid is &#8220;only&#8221; a point-per-game player (22 points in 21 career playoff games).<em> &#8212; Wyshynski<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/headshots\/nhl\/players\/full\/2976847.png&amp;w=43&amp;h=60&amp;scale=crop&amp;background=0xcccccc&amp;transparent=false\" \/><\/p>\n<p>2021-22 stats: 39-18-5 | 2.49 GAA | .916 SV%<br \/>Preseason rank: 10<\/p>\n<p>Only four goalies in NHL history have a better playoff save percentage than Vasilevskiy&#8217;s (.924) in at least 60 postseason games.

That&#8217;s a big-time goal, a key assist, a moment that moves the needle in Edmonton&#8217;s favor. The Oilers battled hard to get back on track and into the postseason at all.
