Earth.<\/p>\n<p>Sunspots are dark regions that pop up on the Sun due to magnetism inside the burning mass.<\/p>\n<p>They can last between a few hours to a few months and are considered \u2018dead\u2019 when they start breaking apart.<\/p>\n<p>A sunspot called AR2987 exploded recently and was considered \u2018dead\u2019 until it randomly \u2018restarted\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>Physicist Philip Judge explained to LiveScience: \u201cOccasionally, sunspots can \u2018restart,\u2019 with more magnetism appearing later (days, weeks) at the same region, as if a weakness was made in the convection zone, or as if there is an unstable region under the surface that is particularly good at generating magnetic fields beneath.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The sunspot explosion on April 11 could impact Earth in a few days time.<\/p>\n<p>According to the experts at SpaceWeather.com: \u201cA CME is heading for Earth.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNOAA forecasters say that G2-class geomagnetic storms are possible when it arrives on April 14th.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDuring such storms, auroras can be seen as far south as, e.g., New York and Idaho (geomagnetic latitude 55 degrees).\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img

solar storm predicted for April 14, is only likely to be a \u201cG2-class\u201d storm.<\/p>\n<p>This type of storm is considered to be moderate and can damage high-latitude power systems.<\/p>\n<p>A G2-class solar storm can affect the power grid and also any spacecraft in orbit.<\/p>\n<p>Ground control may have to keep an eye out to keep spacecraft out of harm\u2019s way.<\/p>\n<p>Solar storms can also confuse migrating animals that rely on the Earth\u2019s magnetic field for a sense of direction.<\/p>\n<p>One good thing about solar storms is that they can produce very pretty natural light displays like the northern lights.<\/p>\n<p>Those natural light displays are called auroras and are examples of the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere getting bombarded by solar wind, which creates pretty green and blue displays.<\/p>\n<p>The Earth\u2019s magnetic field helps to protect us from the more extreme consequences of solar flares.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\"
