Get instant access<\/p>\n<p>Still, considering Bayern played four fewer league matches every season in the 18-team Bundesliga than any of Messi and Ronaldo&#8217;s clubs did in Europe&#8217;s other top five leagues, the fact that Lewandowski managed to score more than either of the two players who shared the Ballon d&#8217;Or exclusively between them over that period makes his feat all the more impressive.<\/p>\n<p>Lewandowski scored 25 goals in all competitions in his debut campaign at Bayern, which would turn out to be his lowest single-season tally. In the seven seasons that followed, the Poland international never once dipped below 40 goals a season. He even twice broke the 50-goal barrier, peaking with 55 goals in 47 games in 2019-20 before also registering 50 goals in 46 games in 2021-22, his final season in Germany.<\/p>\n<p>With prolific output like that fuelling Bayern&#8217;s domination of Germany, it&#8217;s hardly a surprise that Lewandowski can also boast to having won the Bundesliga title in all of the eight seasons he spent at the club, and 19 trophies overall.<\/p>\n<p>Whatever financial gymnastics it took for Barca to stump up the initial \u20ac45m fee to sign Lewandowski, if they can get that level of output from him over the course of his contract, it will be worth every cent.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>An incredible era has come to an end at Bayern Munich with the news that one of the Bundesliga club&#8217;s greatest-ever goal scorers, Robert Lewandowski, has left to embark on a new challenge at Barcelona in LaLiga.2 RelatedEight trophy-laden years after joining on a free transfer from Borussia Dortmund, Lewandowski leaves Bayern after scoring 344&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":4672,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[13],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4671"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4671"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4671\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":6946,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4671\/revisions\/6946"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4671"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4671"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4671"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
