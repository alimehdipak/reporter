I was already making art and decor from reclaimed materials and someone had given me a huge tractor inner tube,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter some weeks of playing with different ideas, I crafted a bra top using an old bra pattern that I had laying around.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Only afterward did she realize it was functional, too.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I tried it on, I realized how comfortable and nicely fitted the material was to be made into a garment,\u201d Martin explained, noting that many of her items are sold out.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"574\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/Jam_Press_JMP184998.jpg?w=574\" alt=\"Martin began her recycled creations in 2012 and has since sold and rented many of her designs. \" \/>Martin began her recycled creations in 2012 and has since sold and rented many of her designs. Jam Press Vid\/@broke_boutique    <\/p>\n<p>Broke Boutique currently rescues six to 13 pounds of rubber from sitting in a landfill every week.<\/p>\n<p>She sources her materials from an industrial estate in Norfolk, where the tractor inner tubes, tires and old bouncy castles are often coated with mud and dust requiring a deep clean before creating the unique designs. <\/p>\n<p>All the recycled materials are free from animal products and latex, making the material safe for people to wear on top of being environmentally friendly. <\/p>\n<p>Martin plans to continue creating her innovative designs to do her part to save the planet as the demand for sustainable fashion continues to increase. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s really great that my business is growing because people love the fact that the brand is truly sustainable. Millions of very low-paid workers are exploited every day to make products that ultimately end up just getting dumped \u2013 and roughly 20% of those clothes go unsold,\u201d she shared. <\/p>\n<p>Nearly 92 million tons of clothes-related waste is discarded globally each year, which is enough to fill the Empire State Building one and a half times every day.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe fast fashion industry has got us into the habit of impulse buying cheap clothing that barely gets worn, we then chuck it and it goes to landfill or gets shipped to third world countries, who then have to deal with our waste,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"574\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/Jam_Press_JMP184999.jpg?w=574\" alt=\"A black chain bra\" \/>Broke Boutique is helping to save the environment with its unique and sustainable designs.
