Chenoweth has also opened up about her excitement to star as the \u201cBackwoods Barbie\u201d and even gave fans a pseudo-audition. <\/p>\n<p>During an appearance on \u201cThe Kelly Clarkson Show\u201d in 2021, guest host Jay Leno asked Chenoweth if she plans to star as Parton in a musical, pointing out that she clearly has the voice \u2014 both speaking and singing \u2014 for the part. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I want to. I\u2019m lacking a couple things \u2014 and I think we both know what they are,\u201d she quipped, gesturing her hands near her breasts. <\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>She noted that Parton has discussed her hopes for the \u201cWicked\u201d star to portray her but shared that there were no solid plans for the project. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cDolly, hurry up! I\u2019m ready!\u201d\u00a0Chenoweth said to the camera. \u201cI just grew up listening to her, and, you know, I do a pretty good \u2026 \u201d before crooning a perfect imitation of Parton\u2019s classic hit \u201cHere You Come Again.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>She then switched things up, sweetly singing a few lines of \u201cJolene,\u201d seemingly proving her right to be cast as Parton\u2019s replica. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2021\/12\/dolly-parton-is-boss-04.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" \/>Dolly Parton still hopes to do a production about her six-decade career in the entertainment business.Getty Images<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Here she comes again.
