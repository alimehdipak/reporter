The last month with more was December 1962, when there were nine 50-point games.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, there have been 17 50-point games this season, and Bey is the 13th player to pull off the feat, matching the most in a season in NBA history. At 22, he is the youngest player with a 50-point game in Pistons history, according to ESPN Stats &amp; Information.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/photo\/2022\/0217\/r975492_1296x1296_1-1.jpg&amp;w=130&amp;h=130&amp;scale=crop&amp;location=center\" width=\"65\" height=\"65\" \/><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Two nights after being torched for 16 points in the first quarter by Brooklyn&#8217;s Kyrie Irving on his way to a 60-point game, the Magic gave up 21 points in the first quarter to Bey.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I saw those highlights and it was just very efficient. It was within the flow of the game,&#8221; Bey said of Irving. &#8220;That was a great performance to watch, and I think just throughout the NBA there&#8217;s been a lot of great performances in the past two weeks. I&#8217;m just grateful to be in this league to have the opportunity.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Marvin Bagley III added 20 points and 11 rebounds for Detroit in the matchup of the bottom two teams in the Eastern Conference. Franz Wagner led Orlando with 26 points.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Rebuilding is always ugly,&#8221; Detroit coach Dwane Casey said, &#8220;but there&#8217;s a lot of beautiful moments like tonight.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Bey, whose previous career-high was 34, finished the first half in spectacular fashion, scoring five points in less than five seconds. He hit a 20-footer while falling out of bounds with 8.8 seconds left, came up with a backcourt steal and made a 3-pointer with 3.9 seconds left, giving the Pistons a 73-62 lead.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;He had 30 points at half so we were definitely expecting 50,&#8221; said Pistons center Isaiah Stewart, who had 16 points and 10 rebounds.<\/p>\n<p>The Magic scored the first nine points of the game, but that lead was quickly erased by Bey. The Pistons moved ahead for keeps on a dunk by Stewart that broke a 50-50 tie midway through the second quarter.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it was just the flow of the game,&#8221; Bey said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t come into the game saying this is what I&#8217;m going to do, but you catch a rhythm and you get in a zone. My teammates did a great job of finding me and just encouraging me to stay aggressive.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Pistons shot 50% and their 134 points was also a season high.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;[Bey] got going early and he hit some really tough shots, but we&#8217;ve got to do a better job &#8212; I&#8217;ve got to do a better job &#8212; of not letting him do what he wants to do,&#8221; Wagner said. &#8220;He shot 14 3s, and we knew before the game we didn&#8217;t want him shooting 3s.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.<\/i><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>ORLANDO, Fla. &#8212; Saddiq Bey went off for a career-high 51 points in the Detroit Pistons&#8217; 134-120 win over the Magic on Thursday night, continuing what has already been a torrid month of individual scoring in the NBA.Bey&#8217;s performance marked the league&#8217;s eighth 50-point game in March, the most in one calendar month over the&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":334,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[13],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/333"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=333"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/333\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=333"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=333"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=333"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
