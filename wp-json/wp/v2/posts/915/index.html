The Tesla founder claimed last week on Twitter that he \u201cmanaged to throw\u201d the sumo wrestler but suffered a back injury in the process. <\/p>\n<p>Musk shared an image of the match, although the neither the date nor the authenticity of the photo could be determined.<\/p>\n<p>\u2018Managed to throw him, but it cost me smashing my c5-c6 disc &amp; 8 years of mega back pain!\u201d Musk tweeted. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cAccording to him, he had some match with a world champion sumo wrestler back in the day for fun, and he f\u2014ed his neck up, like, throwing this guy outside of the ring,\u201d Rogan said. \u201cBut he actually defeated some world champion sumo wrestler.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Rogan, who has cultivated a friendship with Musk and twice invited him to appear on his podcast, suggested that he likes the eccentric billionaire\u2019s chances in a fight with Putin.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cElon Musk is a strange character, because first of all, he\u2019s a very big man. He\u2019s not small. Putin is smaller than me. Elon is quite a bit bigger than me. Elon is probably 6\u20192\u201d and he\u2019s big, he\u2019s a big guy,\u201d Rogan said.<\/p>\n<p>Putin, who was trained as a KGB officer, meanwhile has his own history of posting tough-guy photos on the internet, including a famous shot of him riding shirtless on a horse.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/joe-rogan-train-elon-musk-fight-vladimir-putin-09.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=683\" alt=\"Vladimir Putin\" \/>Vladimir Putin caused a stir in 2009 when photos surfaced of him riding a horse bare-chested during his vacation in southern Siberia.AFP via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>Musk\u2019s bizarre challenge to Putin had previously drew a response from Chechen warlord Ramzan Kadyrov, a longtime Putin crony. Kadyrov slammed Musk over his words toward Putin, referring to him as \u201cgentle (effeminate) Elona\u201d and claiming he wouldn\u2019t stand a chance in a fight.<\/p>\n<p>Kadyrov also suggested the billionaire should train with Chechen special forces to toughen up. Musk rejected Kadyrov\u2019s offer \u2013 though he briefly changed his Twitter name to \u201cElona\u201d following the exchange.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for the offer, but such excellent training would give me too much of an advantage. If he is afraid to fight, I will agree to use only my left hand and I am not even left-handed,\u201d Musk tweeted.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"712\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/joe-rogan-train-elon-musk-fight-vladimir-putin-01-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Elon Musk\" \/>Joe Rogan has twice invited Elon Musk to appear on his podcast.Getty Images    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"632\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/joe-rogan-train-elon-musk-fight-vladimir-putin-03.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Vladimir Putin\" \/>Vladimir Putin has yet to respond to Elon Musk\u2019s challenge.Anadolu Agency via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>Rogan, the popular podcaster who moonlights as a UFC color commentator, revealed he contacted Musk shortly after the Tesla chief challenged Putin to a brawl in response to the war in Ukraine.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI offered my services.
