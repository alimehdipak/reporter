Twenty-five years after the Wings and Avs were locked in a fantastic, relentless and breathtakingly violent winner-take-all battle for NHL supremacy, Avs enforcer Claude Lemieux still likes to point out the prodigious bump on his skull left by Darren McCarty&#8217;s knee. There&#8217;s a similar keepsake on Adam Foote&#8217;s forehead, another one bisecting Patrick Roy&#8217;s right eyebrow and even a slight indentation remains on Kris Draper&#8217;s cheek. To this day the scars the two rivals inflicted upon each other serve as a kind of road map to the epic stretch between 1996 and 2002 that resulted in three Stanley Cups for the Wings and two for the Avalanche. &#8220;Red Wings &#8211; Avalanche was just pure old-school, deep-seated hatred between two teams and two cities,&#8221; says McCarty, the mercurial forward who became one of the rivalry&#8217;s iconic figures. &#8220;That&#8217;s what made this whole thing so beautiful: the hate, and what was at stake.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, during that glorious seven-season run, the Wings and Avs met four times a year during the regular season and five more times during the post-season while managing to bring out the best &#8212; and the worst &#8212; in each other in ways only the Red Sox and Yankees and Celtics and Lakers had ever done before. &#8220;I&#8217;m a University of Michigan fan and somebody said, Who do you hate more, Ohio State or the Colorado Avalanche?&#8221; says former Red Wings trainer John Wharton. &#8220;I was like, you&#8217;re not serious, right? I can&#8217;t stand Ohio State but nobody on their team ever tried to kill one of my teammates.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The epicenter of the rivalry was March 26, 1997, a game held inside Detroit&#8217;s old Joe Louis Arena that has become known in hockey lore as Fight Night at the Joe. The high-stakes revenge game, featuring nine future Hall of Famers, had been simmering for nearly a year, ramped up by bus brawls, sucker punches, horrific injuries, heart-breaking losses, bomb-sniffing dogs and non-stop psychological warfare between the two fan bases. And when the puck finally dropped, the scale of the violence and chaos &#8212; 18 fighting majors, 148 total penalty minutes, the ice soaked with blood, some of it from the goaltenders &#8212; was unlike anything the NHL had ever seen, before or since. Especially in today&#8217;s game where significant changes have made the NHL safer, more entertaining and, at times, unrecognizably genteel to the players from Detroit and Colorado behind the legendary Fight Night at the Joe.<\/p>\n<p>Now, in conjunction with E60&#8217;s presentation of &#8220;Unrivaled,&#8221; we present the story of that epic night, through the voices of the key players, coaches, officials, and witnesses on and around the ice 25 years ago inside the Joe, the peak moment of the greatest of rivalries, one that left an indelible mark on the participants and the game.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"490\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/nhl\/story\/_\/id\/34131852\/\" \/>&#8220;I saw Patrick leave his net and if he leaves, that&#8217;s my guy,&#8221; Red Wings goalie Mike Vernon says of the origins of his clash with Avs counterpart Patrick Roy.\u00a0AP Photo\/Tom Pidgeon<\/p>\n<p><i><b>May 23, 1996.<\/b> Denver&#8217;s McNichols Sports Arena. Game 3 of the Conference Finals. After winning a record 62 games during the regular season, the high-flying Detroit Red Wings are heavy favorites to win the Cup and end their four-decade championship drought. &#8220;And it was an easy 62,&#8221; says McCarty, &#8220;probably could have been 70.&#8221; In the Conference Finals, though, the Wings run full force into the far more physical Avs who bully their way to a shocking 2-0 lead in the series. In the first period of Game 3 Adam Foote moves in on Slava Kozlov from behind to close down a play in the corner. The Detroit winger slips the hit and slams Foote&#8217;s face into the glass, opening a huge gash on his forehead. Foote returns to the game and scores a goal, but Kozlov is not penalized for the hit, enraging the Avs and especially their enforcer, Claude Lemieux.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><img height=\"75px\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/nhl\/story\/_\/id\/34131852\/ https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0614\/nhl_hockey_fight_Adam_Foote.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Adam Foote, Avs defenseman<\/p>\n<p>So many times all people talk about is the Kris Draper hit as the start of everything and I&#8217;m always going, uh, wait a minute here.

Once ranked by TSN as the second-most hated player in NHL history (behind Sean Avery) Lemieux is fined $1,000 and suspended for Game 4 of the 1996 Conference Finals. He plays tentatively in Game 5. And with the Avs headed back to Denver up 3-2, with a chance to eliminate the best regular-season team in NHL history, Crawford tells Lemieux to stop playing like a ballerina. Colorado has a 1-0 lead with 5:53 left in the first period when Kris Draper collects the puck in front of the Avs bench. Beloved in Detroit for his blue-collar approach, Draper, who the Wings acquired on waivers for $1, is the heart and soul of the team&#8217;s infamous &#8220;Grind Line,&#8221; alongside McCarty. On and off the ice Draper and McCarty are like brothers. After dumping the puck against the Avs, Draper continues to move backward along the boards. Just as he turns toward the Red Wings bench, Lemieux barrels into him from behind at full speed. With no time or space to react, Draper&#8217;s face is driven directly into the dasher on top of the boards. The dry-twig snapping sound of Draper&#8217;s cheek shattering and caving in against the boards haunts everyone who witnessed the hit to this day.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><img height=\"75px\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/nhl\/story\/_\/id\/34131852\/ https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0614\/nhl_hockey_fight_Kris_Draper.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Kris Draper, Wings center<\/p>\n<p>I knew I was hit from behind. I had no idea the extent of what my injuries were. I was down on my hands and knees and tried to get up but my legs wouldn&#8217;t move the way I wanted them to. The one thing that really stands out after all this time was the look on our trainer John Wharton&#8217;s face when he saw my face.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"75px\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/nhl\/story\/_\/id\/34131852\/ https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0614\/nhl_hockey_fight_John_Wharton.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>John Wharton, Wings trainer, 1990-2002<\/p>\n<p>I actually felt it. It literally shook the boards. For people who can&#8217;t understand what Draper&#8217;s injury was like, I would ask you to just go put your cheekbone and your upper teeth up against a hard 90-degree angle surface, be it a granite countertop or a wooden desk, or a steel appliance. Then imagine somebody curb stomps you from behind. He literally had a four-inch dent from his cheek down to the top of his front teeth. He had the imprint of the boards, a 90-degree divot, across his face.<\/p>\n<p>I was over the boards really quickly, because, I knew this was potentially a very tragic injury. Kris is asking &#8220;Who the f&#8212; was that?&#8221; And I told him, &#8220;Kris, this is not good. We&#8217;ve got to backboard you.&#8221; And before I could even finish, he says, &#8220;Like f&#8212; you are.&#8221; And he skates away. That&#8217;s hockey players. I was pretty confident that the spinal cord was intact, but I didn&#8217;t want to take any chances. But I also knew that shock was going to set in imminently. Two steps into the Red Wings medical room I could feel Kris&#8217;s weight. He was passing out.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"75px\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/nhl\/story\/_\/id\/34131852\/ https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0614\/nhl_hockey_fight_Claude_Lemieux.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Lemieux <\/p>\n<p>The way I played the game, if there was somebody in front of you, you finished the hit.

The play left Draper with significant injuries and poured gas on the smoldering rivalry.\u00a0The Denver Public Library, Western History Collection, WH2129<\/p>\n<p><i>Detroit&#8217;s dream season is over. The Wings limp to a 4-1 loss and are eliminated from the playoffs before any of the players know the full extent of Draper&#8217;s injuries. When they find out, Wings forward Dino Ciccarelli seethes to the press, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I shook [Lemieux&#8217;s] freakin&#8217; hand right after the game. That pisses me right off.&#8221; Asked about the injury, Lemieux finishes a beer, crumples the can, tosses it away and says he is tired of talking about the whiny Red Wings. With Draper unconscious in the Red Wings training room, an irate Detroit owner Mike Ilitch demands photos of Draper&#8217;s injury for the league hearing and a possible criminal prosecution against Lemieux. Draper is cleared to fly home with the team on Red Bird One, where the pilots are kept on constant alert in case Draper requires an emergency landing. Lemieux is suspended for two Stanley Cup Finals games, an unprecedented punishment for the time, but the Avs hardly need him, sweeping the Panthers to win the franchise&#8217;s first title since relocating to Denver in 1995. Back in Detroit, all an outraged Hockeytown can do is stew for the next nine months as Draper undergoes surgery to insert a titanium plate in his cheek and a grueling six-week rehab and liquid diet. The Red Wings wait for an apology from Lemieux that never comes.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><img height=\"75px\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/nhl\/story\/_\/id\/34131852\/ https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0614\/nhl_hockey_fight_Darren_McCarty.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>McCarty <\/p>\n<p>It was so frustrating.

Lemieux is out of the lineup for the first two games with an abdominal injury, however, and the third game is in Denver, where the Avs seem to purposefully limit the time Lemieux and McCarty spend on the ice together. Colorado wins all three games, which ramps up the tension to a fever pitch for the final matchup: March 26, 1997 at Joe Louis Arena. <\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>Gamesmanship abounds on both sides. Detroit accuses Colorado of shortening their bench in Denver. In Detroit, the Avs never eat anything that isn&#8217;t prepared by their own chefs and always seem to have issues at the Joe, be it a lack of hot water, noxious paint in the locker room or pre-game meals that don&#8217;t show up. But March 26, 1997 is an entirely new level of intensity. <\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>Up until this point, Colorado has flat-out owned Detroit, a team known for being pretty but not gritty. Realizing that his talented Red Wings roster still needs to gel and add a physical edge to their game, Detroit&#8217;s brilliant Bowman, who would win nine Stanley Cups as a coach, seizes on Lemieux&#8217;s hit on Draper, and his lack of remorse, as a rallying cry.

We were getting a lot of death threats. And I was taking that seriously. I was not worried about so much what could happen on the ice. I was much more worried about what could happen off the ice. I thought it was blown out of proportion, and my first game back in Detroit in 1997, I&#8217;m told I&#8217;m not going to have a roommate, in Detroit my roommate is going to be a police officer posted outside my hotel room. Then we got a memo from the league before the game that no one is to warm up without a helmet. Everybody&#8217;s got to wear a helmet. It was a wake up call for all of us. But especially for myself, being a husband and a father. I didn&#8217;t want to get shot.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"75px\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/nhl\/story\/_\/id\/34131852\/ https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0614\/nhl_hockey_fight_Kris_Draper.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Draper<\/p>\n<p>It was the sounds that I&#8217;ll never forget.

A little less than five minutes after that, the fighting begins inside the Joe. <\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>In what Crawford describes as &#8220;the undercard&#8221; at 4:45 in the first period, Colorado&#8217;s Brent Severyn battles Detroit&#8217;s Jamie Pushor. A few minutes later, the Wings&#8217; Kirk Maltby drops the Avs&#8217; Rene Corbet. The teams are on the verge of making it to the first intermission nearly unscathed when a pair of future Hall of Famers, Peter Forsberg and Igor Larionov, inexplicably square off. (In all, five of the 12 players on the ice for the ensuing donnybrook would become Hall of Famers.) Known as The Professor, Larionov has accrued a grand total of 26 penalty minutes in all of 1997. But when Forsberg knocks him onto his backside away from the play and in front of the Red Wings bench, then punches him in the head as he tries to regain his footing, something just snaps &#8212; in the mild-mannered Larionov, and then, in everyone else. Until this writing, though, no one knows that a secret connection between Lemieux and the Wings&#8217; alternate captain, Brendan Shanahan, truly triggers the historic melee.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><img height=\"75px\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/nhl\/story\/_\/id\/34131852\/ https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0614\/nhl_hockey_fight_Darren_McCarty.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>McCarty <\/p>\n<p>I saw Forsberg and Igor and I did a loop to see what was happening, but my initial thought was: &#8220;Those two?&#8221; It&#8217;s like cute puppies on Christmas morning.

He. Had. Enough. And the minute he did that I knew: This was it. But Foote had me good. He had me in a double arm bar, and it was tight enough that I was really struggling to get out of it. So if you really break all this down, Shanny is the key. In that moment, Shanny had to choose: bust me loose or go after Claude himself.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"75px\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/nhl\/story\/_\/id\/34131852\/ https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0614\/nhl_hockey_fight_Brendan_Shanahan.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Shanahan<\/p>\n<p>My deep dark secret was that I had played with Claude Lemieux and we were friends. I actually really liked Claude Lemieux a lot, but not on the ice. When I arrived in Detroit (via trade in 1997), I knew the history with Kris Draper and Claude Lemieux, and now these are my new brothers and that&#8217;s the way it is.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"75px\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/nhl\/story\/_\/id\/34131852\/ https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0614\/nhl_hockey_fight_Claude_Lemieux.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Lemieux <\/p>\n<p>I played with Shanny in New Jersey and I absolutely loved that kid.

I had gotten into it with somebody and Claude skated by and he looked at me and he said, &#8220;Ah, you&#8217;re a loser. You haven&#8217;t won anything.&#8221; I was yelling at him and I remember thinking, like, he&#8217;s completely released me of any feelings of regret or apprehension of what I&#8217;m willing to do to win.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not our first rodeo for guys that do this in hockey, especially in the &#8217;90s. So you look around and Lemieux&#8217;s on the ice and McCarty&#8217;s on the ice. Darren was sort of tied up with Adam Foote, so I came over and grabbed Adam Foote and Darren got loose. And he was on Lemieux, fast.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"75px\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/nhl\/story\/_\/id\/34131852\/ https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0614\/nhl_hockey_fight_Darren_McCarty.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>McCarty <\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not the first guy or the last guy to try and take his head off or want to cause him bodily harm on the ice. But for whatever reason Claude was just kinda out of it that night. For me, it was total premeditation. For me, it was all about trying to remove his head from his body. But Claude was skating back to the bench like doo-da-doo-da-doo, like Dopey the Dope Goat or something.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"75px\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/nhl\/story\/_\/id\/34131852\/ https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0614\/nhl_hockey_fight_Claude_Lemieux.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Lemieux <\/p>\n<p>I was clearly avoiding anything. I look horrible. I was avoiding any contact probably because I certainly didn&#8217;t want this to happen. But it&#8217;s happening.<\/p>\n<p><i>Near center ice, with the help of Shanahan, McCarty is able to spin out of Foote&#8217;s grip and in one motion pounce on an a strangely resigned Lemieux. A natural lefty forced to lead with his right, McCarty overcompensates his windup, and the extra rotational torque combined with the weight of his hockey glove is devastating. The punch lands squarely on the right temple of Lemieux, who crumbles like a dynamited building down to the ice where one of the most feared players in NHL history does the unthinkable: Lemieux &#8220;turtles&#8221; for protection. It doesn&#8217;t work.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><img height=\"75px\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/nhl\/story\/_\/id\/34131852\/ https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0614\/nhl_hockey_fight_Claude_Lemieux.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Lemieux <\/p>\n<p>He hit me with his glove on. All I remember is I&#8217;m down and I&#8217;m getting hit. Anyone that&#8217;s been hit or has played the game, you know when you&#8217;re in trouble. I knew I was in trouble. So you hang on tight. You take your beating. And it will be what it will be. From that point on I don&#8217;t know where I&#8217;m at and I&#8217;m just hanging on. I&#8217;m conscious but when you get in that position, there&#8217;s no fight to be had.

I didn&#8217;t even feel it. When you hit somebody perfectly on the button like that it feels like butter. I hit him, he goes down, then I get his helmet off and I pick him up off the ice and I f&#8212;ing wailed on him with a left uppercut or two, and that&#8217;s the punch that cut him. I got really good connection on that one. Oh, it felt so good.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"75px\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/nhl\/story\/_\/id\/34131852\/ https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0614\/nhl_hockey_fight_Bob_Wojnowski.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Bob Wojnowski, Detroit News columnist<\/p>\n<p>When Lemieux was felled the noise in that arena was something I&#8217;ve never heard.

With an unobstructed view from the Avs&#8217; net, goaltender Patrick Roy holds back as long as he can before launching himself on a beeline to rescue a prostrate Lemieux. This split-second decision leads to a spectacular, Matrix-like, midair collision between Roy and Shanahan, a devastating injury, and then, the greatest goaltender fight of all time between Roy and Mike Vernon; a remarkable brawl that features at least a dozen haymakers.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><img height=\"75px\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/nhl\/story\/_\/id\/34131852\/ https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0614\/nhl_hockey_fight_Patrick_Roy.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Roy<\/p>\n<p>It was stupid by me, I guess I have no business there.

Blood pouring from Lemieux&#8217;s temple turns a 3-foot section of ice crimson. His eyes are open but Lemieux is out cold and leaning heavily on a referee. Lemieux recovers and comes back to assist on the Avs&#8217; final goal but up until recently he has no recollection of returning to the game.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><img height=\"75px\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/nhl\/story\/_\/id\/34131852\/ https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0614\/nhl_hockey_fight_John_Wharton.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Wharton<\/p>\n<p>It was almost like a symphony.

While one ref desperately tries to scrape the blood off the ice with his skates, the players retrieve their gear and Roy, Forsberg and Lemieux retreat to have their wounds dressed. Lemieux is stitched up by a member of the Red Wings&#8217; medical staff whose hands tremble during the entire procedure. Meanwhile, Devorski begins to tally up the penalties. Overwhelmed by a level of utter chaos and uber violence that would be unrecognizable in today&#8217;s game &#8212; the YouTube footage from the Joe still carries a &#8220;viewer discretion&#8221; warning &#8212; Devorski unwittingly adds to the anarchy by giving McCarty only a double minor. The Avs get a four-minute power play, but, somehow, McCarty is allowed to stay in the game, as are Roy and Vernon. The Wings&#8217; goaltender is so certain he&#8217;s kicked out he&#8217;s slumped in his locker stall recovering when a team official races in to tell Vernon to put his gear back on and get in net.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><img height=\"75px\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/nhl\/story\/_\/id\/34131852\/ https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0614\/nhl_hockey_fight_Paul_Devorski.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Devorski<\/p>\n<p>I kept thinking in my head, Lemieux had it coming. Did he deserve it? Yeah, he probably did. I still remember seeing Kris Draper&#8217;s head all smacked up [in 1996] and he just looked terrible, and I think that&#8217;s what this was all about. It was payback time, and it happened that night. Marc Crawford and my linesmen were a little upset that I didn&#8217;t throw McCarty out. So I went over and explained to Crawford that, yes, McCarty should definitely have been thrown out. For some reason, I didn&#8217;t give him the instigator and I should have. To this day, I really screwed up on that game. But in my heart I just said, you know what? Payback is a bitch.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"75px\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/nhl\/story\/_\/id\/34131852\/ https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0614\/nhl_hockey_fight_Darren_McCarty.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>McCarty <\/p>\n<p>We all packed into the coaches room to watch a replay of the fight. We laughed at the fact that I didn&#8217;t get kicked out, and we laughed at the fact that I only got four minutes. One of the most unbelievable things about that whole era of hockey was what we were able to get away with on the ice. It was cool because Scotty Bowman let us sort of enjoy that for like 10 minutes, and then we had to get back to the real task at hand, to win the game.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"75px\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/nhl\/story\/_\/id\/34131852\/ https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0614\/nhl_hockey_fight_Brendan_Shanahan.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Shanahan<\/p>\n<p>When Darren saw the replay of all the things that were going on behind him, he was shocked.

We&#8217;re all gonna fight until we die!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><i>The Avs certainly try to make good on that pledge. The second period features five new fights, 78 penalty minutes, two game misconduct penalties and more memorable mayhem. Every inch of ice is contested. Every check is finished. Elbows fly. Sticks fly. More fists, teeth and blood fly. The crowd is deafening and relentless. And every whistle seems to feature a nasty scrum that threatens to implode into a bench-clearing clash. At this point, with 18 fighting majors handed out, the violence is almost cartoonish. Roy&#8217;s injury is bad enough that he starts trying on teammates&#8217; shoulder braces between periods. (He says now that he &#8220;should have left the game.&#8221;) Covered in blood splatter, the back of Tomas Holmstrom&#8217;s Detroit jersey looks like a Jackson Pollock painting. Colorado&#8217;s Brent Severyn brawls with Aaron Ward for several minutes behind the net while completely bare-chested after his jersey and pads are ripped off &#8212; all while fans wave &#8220;SCREW LEMIEUX&#8221; signs and &#8220;We Don&#8217;t Have to Take Our Clothes Off (To Have a Good Time)&#8221; blasts from the Joe Louis speakers. But the most shocking development of all is that by early in the third period, Detroit still trails Colorado 5-3. The Wings have avenged Draper &#8212; and then some &#8212; but it will all be for naught if they lose for the fifth straight time to the Avs.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><img height=\"75px\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/nhl\/story\/_\/id\/34131852\/ https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0614\/nhl_hockey_fight_Darren_McCarty.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>McCarty <\/p>\n<p>That was the catalyst to why this all happened &#8212; we had to win the game and we had to win that game because up until that point they had owned us.<\/p>\n<p><img height=\"75px\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/nhl\/story\/_\/id\/34131852\/ https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0614\/nhl_hockey_fight_Claude_Lemieux.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Lemieux <\/p>\n<p>If the Wings don&#8217;t win that game, it sends a message: &#8220;Yeah, you beat up Lemieux and a few other guys, but you still lost.

We responded and they responded. There were more fights. We won some, they won some. But what was frustrating was once again, they were beating us.

One of our coaches sort of said something on the bench like, &#8220;Well, if we&#8217;re not gonna win we better really send a message.&#8221; As much as we had been sending messages all night, the collective response on the bench from all of us players was: We&#8217;re gonna win, and this game is not over.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"419\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/nhl\/story\/_\/id\/34131852\/\" \/>McCarty scored the winning goal in overtime. &#8220;It was just that proverbial exhale moment. We did it. We&#8217;re going to be alright,&#8221; he says of the cathartic outcome that rallied the Wings.\u00a0Julian Gonzalez, Detroit Free Press, USA Today Network<\/p>\n<p><i>In the third period, a relentless onslaught by the desperate Wings pushes the shots on net to 47-19 in Detroit&#8217;s favor. Eventually, Roy shows signs of being human. Halfway through the period, the Wings score twice in 24 seconds, tying the game on a wrap-around goal that Shanahan bounces off the back of Roy&#8217;s left skate. Overtime. In the first minute of OT, a back-checking Shanahan forces a turnover by Lemieux in the neutral zone. Larionov picks up the puck along the boards and weaves through three defenders to gain the Avs&#8217; zone. Instead of continuing across to open ice, though, the Professor brilliantly drives toward the net. This not only sets a pick for McCarty, allowing him to shoot deep and cross to the left of the net, it gives Shanahan time to curl back up and jump up into the right side of the play. <\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>McCarty, who grew up dreaming of being a Red Wing in Leamington, Ontario, about 40 miles from Joe Louis Arena, recognizes the play right away from thousands of hours of running the classic three-man weave drill as a kid. This time, though, McCarty and Shanahan wind up in opposite spots, which is less than ideal. Shanahan reaches the top of the face-off circle and bangs his stick. Larionov pushes him the puck, forcing Roy to come way out of net to overplay Shanahan&#8217;s shot. The air seems to leave the Joe as the crowd falls completely silent.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><img height=\"75px\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/nhl\/story\/_\/id\/34131852\/ https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0614\/nhl_hockey_fight_Brendan_Shanahan.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Shanahan<\/p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t believe I passed it.

There was a shift in our confidence, a shift in our team, in the building, in the fans and in the city of Detroit. Not only did we beat them, we also beat the crap out of them. There&#8217;s a belief you need, I don&#8217;t care who you are or what team you are, you need that moment when you finally truly believe you can do it.
