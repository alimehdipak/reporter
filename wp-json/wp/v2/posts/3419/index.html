Including international showings, its worldwide total is $248 million.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a supersonic start for a film that still has the wide-open skies of Memorial Day itself to rake in even more cash. According to projections and estimates, by Monday\u2019s close, \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d will likely have over $150 million.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThese results are ridiculously, over-the-top fantastic,\u201d said Chris Aronson, Paramount\u2019s president of domestic distribution. \u201cI\u2019m happy for everyone. I\u2019m happy for the company, for Tom, for the filmmakers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Though undeniably one of the biggest stars in the world \u2014 perhaps even \u201cthe last movie star,\u201d according to various headlines \u2014 Cruise is not known for massive blockbuster openings.<\/p>\n<p>Before \u201cMaverick,\u201d his biggest domestic debut was in 2005, with Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cWar of the Worlds,\u201d which opened to $64 million. After that it was \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Fallout\u201d with $61 million in 2018. It\u2019s not that his films don\u2019t make money in the long run: They just aren\u2019t enormously frontloaded.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/top-gun.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Tom Cruise played \" \/>Tom Cruise played Pete \u201cMaverick\u201d Mitchell in the 1986 film.\u00a9Paramount\/Courtesy Everett    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d had an extremely long journey to get to the theaters. The sequel to the late Tony Scott\u2019s \u201cTop Gun,\u201d which was released in 1986, was originally slated to open in the summer of 2020. Its marketing campaign technically started back in July 2019. The pandemic got in the way of those plans, however, and it was delayed several times. Directed by Joseph Kosinski, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and co-produced and co-financed by Skydance, the sequel reportedly cost $152 million to make.<\/p>\n<p>But even as the months, and years, went by and many other companies chose to compromise on hybrid releases, Cruise and Paramount didn\u2019t waver on their desire to have a major theatrical release. A streaming debut was simply not an option.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat was never going to happen,\u201d\u00a0Cruise said in Cannes.<\/p>\n<p>And it is major, with 4,735 North American theaters (a record) showing \u201cTop Gun: Maverick.\u201d It also opened in 23,600 locations in 62 international markets.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is one of the longest runways for a marketing campaign for any film ever. And it only served to create more excitement around the movie,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cThis movie literally waited for the movie theater to come back.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The build up has been just as flashy, with fighter-jet-adorned premieres on an\u00a0aircraft carrier in San Diego\u00a0and at the\u00a0Cannes Film Festival, where Cruise was also given an honorary Palme d\u2019Or, and a\u00a0royal premiere in London\u00a0attended by Prince William and his wife Kate.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe feeling you get when you watch this film with an audience, it\u2019s pretty special,\u201d Aronson said. \u201cThe first big screening we had, there was spontaneous applause during the movie.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Reviews\u00a0have been stellar, too, with the film notching a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes. Audiences, who were 58% male, gave it an A+ CinemaScore, according to exit polls.<\/p>\n<p>The new film has Cruise reprising the role of Maverick, who returns to the elite aviation training program to train the next generation of flyers, including Miles Teller, Glen Powell, Monica Barbaro, Greg Tarzan Davis, Danny Ramirez, Lewis Pullman and Jay Ellis. Jennifer Connelly, Jon Hamm and Val Kilmer, reprising his role from the original, also star.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis solidifies the notion that the movie theater is a singular and a vitally important outlet for people,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cPeople are looking for a great escape from everything that\u2019s going on in the world right now.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMaverick\u201d is now among the top pandemic era openings, still led by \u201cSpider-Man: No Way Home\u201d with $260 million, followed by \u201cDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness\u201d with $187 million and \u201cThe Batman\u201d with $134 million.<\/p>\n<p>Notably, \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d is the only non-superhero movie in the bunch. It also attracted a wide swath of age groups to the theater. An estimated 55% of the audience was over 35.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSuperhero movies aren\u2019t for everybody. This movie is for everyone and that\u2019s what sets it apart,\u201d Aronson said. \u201cThe theatrical exhibition business has challenges ahead of it, but this is a shot in the arm for that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Bob\u2019s Burgers Movie\u201d was the only new release that dared go up against \u201cTop Gun.\u201d Released by 20th Century Studios and Disney, the animated pic earned $12.6 million from 3,425 locations. It opened in third place, behind \u201cDoctor Strange 2,\u201d which earned $16.4 million in its fourth weekend in theaters.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTop Gun\u201d will continue to essentially have the skies to itself until \u201cJurassic World: Dominion\u201d opens on June 10.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt has a really nice, open marketplace to play,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cTom Cruise has always been about consistency. His movies are about the marathon. This is the first movie of his that is sprinting to big box office numbers. Here, he gets the sprint and the marathon.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore.
