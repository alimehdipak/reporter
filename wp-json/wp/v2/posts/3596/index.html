A video of the impromptu animal controller\u2019s good deed is now going viral on Instagram, and city slickers praise her varmint-handling prowess.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was like, \u2018Alright I got this.\u2019 I told everyone, \u2018Listen, I\u2019m from Alaska, let me handle it,\u2019 \u201d Sara Fulton \u2014 who goes by @Sarakalee on Instagram \u2014 told The Post of handling the unwanted customer. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to question someone from Alaska. So that\u2019s when I went up to the opossum and scruffed him and took him outside.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This now-viral incident went down at Temkin\u2019s Bar in Greenpoint last week, sending patrons into a panic. <\/p>\n<p>Flatbush resident Fulton, 33, painted the scene: \u201cI was outside hanging out with my friend, and we see this critter run into the bar and we\u2019re like, \u2018What is that? Is that like a rat?\u2019 And then I was like, \u2018Wait, it\u2019s too big to be a rat.\u2019 [So] we go in and we see everyone on the other side of the bar freaking out.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s when the Anchorage native\u2019s pal \u201ccornered him.\u201d Meanwhile, since the Temkin\u2019s clientele were \u201closing their minds,\u201d Fulton figured, \u201cI\u2019m the calmest one here in this situation,\u201d and rolled down the sleeves of her denim jacket to take care of business.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/woman-hero-possum-brooklyn-bar-feat-image.jpg?w=1024\" \/>\u201cHold my phone \u2014 I\u2019m from Alaska,\u201d Sara Fulton declared in the viral clip after the opossum wandered into the Greenpoint, Brooklyn, bar. Her inadvertent catchphrase has since spawned a T-shirt emblazoned with the now-viral words.
