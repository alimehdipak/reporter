But it appears the actual price O\u2019Neal paid for it must have been way above asking. While the final sale price is hush-hush, the previous listing did note that there was a deadline for final offers by April 21 \u2014\u00a0only three days after it first hit the market. <\/p>\n<p>The competitive housing market means O\u2019Neal likely overpaid for the property significantly. According to the Dallas Morning News, which was the first to report the transaction, O\u2019Neal\u2019s expansion of his Big Chicken restaurant chain in Texas was a factor in the purchase.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt has a lot to do with that, and basic travel \u2014 he travels here quite a bit for different things,\u201d Zac Gideo, a real estate agent for Rogers Healy who worked with O\u2019Neal to buy the home, told the outlet, adding that the star plans on living here part-time. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/shaq-dallas-home-2_0.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"The home spans over 5,200 square feet.\" \/>The home spans over 5,200 square feet.
