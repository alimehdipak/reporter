(If only someone had told all Karen\u2019s before their raging fits.)<\/p>\n<p>Blue medical masks were associated with being the most attractive, and cloth masks were a close second still making faces \u201csignificantly more attractive,\u201d according to researchers at Cardiff University\u2019s School of Psychology in the UK.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur study suggests faces are considered most attractive when covered by medical face masks,\u201d co-author Michael B.

Medical masks came out on top, with cloth coming in close second and no covering ranking last.<\/p>\n<p>The results suggested that covering the bottom half of your face in any way, whether you are hot or not, increased people\u2019s attractiveness \u2014 showing that the results were not necessarily about hiding unattractive qualities.<\/p>\n<p>The reason could be that covering the bottom half of your face brings a certain allure and sense of mystery \u2014 a surefire turn-on, as many studies and publications have claimed that 93% of communication comes from nonverbal cues, including smiling and frowning. <\/p>\n<p>Masks also force attention on the eyes and hair \u2014 two of our most engaging facial features, the study noted.<\/p>\n<p>Before the pandemic hit, medical face masks were mostly associated with illness, but since COVID forced everyone to wear masks for nearly two years, our thoughts about seeing people wearing masks, namely of the medical variety, in public have changed drastically.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe results run counter to the pre-pandemic research where it was thought masks made people think about disease and the person should be avoided,\u201d Lewis noted. \u201cThe pandemic has changed our psychology in how we perceive the wearers of masks. When we see someone wearing a mask we no longer think \u2018that person has a disease, I need to stay away.&#8217;\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/blue-surgical-face-mask-4.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Woman in a protective mask holding her phone\" \/>Since the pandemic began, wearing a blue medical mask has gained positive connotations. Getty Images\/Westend61    <\/p>\n<p>Blue medical masks, in particular, could be considered the most attractive because of their associations with medical professionals or the \u201cwhite-coat effect\u201d in which females find male doctors sexier when wearing a white coat.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis may be because we\u2019re used to healthcare workers wearing blue masks and now we associate these with people in caring or medical professions,\u201d Lewis added. \u201cAt a time when we feel vulnerable, we may find the wearing of medical masks reassuring and so feel more positive towards the wearer.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Masks can also \u201cbe seen as a sign of being responsible and caring citizens, which may positively impact perceived attractiveness.\u201d Throughout the pandemic wearing masks has been seen as a sign of respect and doing one\u2019s part to help society, which are great traits to add to your dating profile.<\/p>\n<p>Lewis told The Guardian that a second study, with men rating masked women, is currently being carried out.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Forget Gua Sha face stones, ice rollers and lip fillers, you probably already have the simplest and most effective tool to make your face more attractive: a blue medical mask.
