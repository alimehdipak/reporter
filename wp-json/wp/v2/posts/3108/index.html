But it\u2019s not exactly the profit you would think if he is able to score his initial asking price. <\/p>\n<p>Spanning over 7,300 square feet, the space underwent a whopping $7.5 million renovation with an elite team including designer Deborah Wecselman of Wecselman Design, architect Wesley Kean of KoDA, contractor Larqcon Group, and landscape architecture firm Enea.<\/p>\n<p>Inside, the staircase within the foyer acts as an art gallery with pieces from Picasso, Robert Pruitt, Allora &amp; Calzadilla, and Ernie Barnes.  Hints of Joyner\u2019s favorite color red are sprinkled throughout each piece of work while a custom Bocci pendant light hangs from the ceiling.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/tom-joyner-home-05.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"The property spans over 7,400 square feet. \" \/>The property spans over 7,300 square feet.
