This prevents the bird\u2019s head from drying out. The bird will continue its cycle until the head dries out and evaporation can no longer cool it.<\/p>\n<h3>What is the dipping bird called?<\/h3>\n<p>Drinking birds, also known as insatiable birdies, dunking birds, drinky birds, water birds, dipping birds, and \u201cSippy Chickens\u201d are toy heat engines that mimic the motions of a bird drinking from a water source. They are sometimes incorrectly considered examples of a perpetual motion device.<\/p>\n<p>What liquid is in dipping bird?<\/p>\n<p>Inside, the drinking bird is a highly volatile liquid known as methylene chloride (CH2Cl2). Since methylene chloride is colorless, coloring must be added to enhance the visual effect. This liquid is also highly volatile, meaning it evaporates rapidly due to weak intermolecular bonds in the liquid state.<\/p>\n<p>Is the drinking bird a heat engine?<\/p>\n<p>The drinking bird is, essentially, a heat engine, in which the hot reservoir is the abdomen, and the cold reservoir is the head. The working fluid is methylene chloride, and it is put through its cycle by transfer of heat between the abdomen and the head.<\/p>\n<p>How do you use the thirsty bird?<\/p>\n<p>How does it work? Simply moisten the bird\u2019s head with water, place it next to a full glass of water and watch as the bird periodically dunks its head into the glass for a \u201cdrink\u201d. It continues for hours.<\/p>\n<h3>How do you adjust a drinking bird?<\/h3>\n<p>Most Drinking Birds work without adjustment, but sometimes a small tweak to the pivot point of the bird is needed to make sure the bird is at equilibrium. Carefully move the metal clip up or down the glass tube, (ca. one millimeter), until the Drinking Bird just balances in a vertical position.<\/p>\n<p>Is the drinking bird perpetual?<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes the drinking bird is called a perpetual motion machine, but there is no such thing as perpetual motion, which would violate the laws of thermodynamics. The bird only works as long as water is evaporating from its beak, producing an energy change in the system.<\/p>\n<p>What is inside a drinking bird?<\/p>\n<p>The drinking bird works because of thermodynamics. The bird is made of a top bulb and a bottom bulb, separated by a narrow tube. Inside the bird is a liquid called dicloromethane, which evaporates at room temperature. The bottom bulb contains the liquid, while the top bulb contains evaporated dicloromethane gas.<\/p>\n<p>How do you make a homemade drinking bird?<\/p>\n<p>Dunking Bird<\/p>\n<p>Fill one of the two glass bulbs with methylene chloride. Insert a glass tube into the filled bulb, almost to the bottom, then seal the bulb opening around the tube. Seal the second bulb onto the top of the tube, except for a small opening for evacuation.<\/p>\n<h3>How does the dipping duck work?<\/h3>\n<p>To operate the Dippy Bird, you get its head wet. As the water evaporates, fluid moves up into the head, causing the bird to become top-heavy and dip forward. Once the bird dips forward, fluid moves back into the abdomen, causing the bird to become bottom-heavy and tip up.<\/p>\n<p>How do you adjust a drinking bird?<\/p>\n<p>Most Drinking Birds work without adjustment, but sometimes a small tweak to the pivot point of the bird is needed to make sure the bird is at equilibrium.

The bird only works as long as water is evaporating from its beak, producing an energy change in the system.<\/p>\n<p>Does humidity affect the drinking bird?<\/p>\n<p>As mentioned, air humidity affects the bird\u2019s period if wa- ter is the external liquid. At room temperature, when the vapor partial pressure, PE, is equal to the liquid\u2013vapor equi- librium pressure at that temperature, PE(TR), the water on the head no longer evaporates and the bird stops.<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Each time the bird\u2019s beak dips into the water, the fuzzy material absorbs a little water to replace any that has evaporated.
