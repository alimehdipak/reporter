But it also comes with roommates in the form of ghouls, though it\u2019s not clear whether they contribute to paying the bills.<\/p>\n<p>The sellers, paranormal investigators Jenn and Cory Heinzen, purchased the home for $439,000 in 2019 \u2014 and spent four months keeping themselves to one room as \u201ca sign of respect for the spirits, letting them get used to us instead of barging in,\u201d they told the Wall Street Journal at the time of listing. However, that didn\u2019t stop a black-colored figure once seen looking in at them from the doorway of their room.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/conjuring-01.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"The Rhode Island residence is said to be haunted by the spirit of Bathsheba Sherman, who lived there in the 1800s.\" \/>The Rhode Island residence is said to be haunted by the spirit of Bathsheba Sherman, who lived there in the 1800s.Mott &amp; Chace Sotheby\u2019s International Realty    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/conjuring-19.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"The property stands on 8.5 acres of land -- and surrounded by woods, can anyone hear you scream?\" \/>The property stands on 8.5 acres of land \u2014 and is surrounded by woods.

The pair also have heard footsteps and knocks \u2014 and have even seen flashes of light in rooms that don\u2019t have lights in them.<\/p>\n<p>The Journal also first broke the news of this sale, adding that the new owner is a Boston real-estate developer named Jacqueline Nu\u00f1ez, 58. She was one of more than 10 offers on the property \u2014 and one of the prospective owners interviewed by the sellers to make sure they met the requirements, including not living in the home for the buyer\u2019s own good.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a very personal purchase for me,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez, who was represented by Ricardo Rodriguez and Bethany Eddy of Coldwell Banker Realty in Providence, told the Journal. \u201cWhen it hit the market, I thought, \u2018This is a property that enables people to speak to the dead.&#8217;\u201d Nu\u00f1ez added she doesn\u2019t feel the house is home to a demon \u2014 but simply a structure that is \u201cuniquely an amplifier for our energy, attitudes and beliefs. If your end goal is to be terrified, it can deliver. Or if you go there to connect with a loved one, it can deliver that, too,\u201d she told the paper.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/dining-room-03.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"If the home has too much spook, focus on its historical charm, which includes beamed ceilings and fireplaces.\" \/>If the home has too much spook, focus on its historical charm, which includes beamed ceilings and fireplaces.Mott &amp; Chace Sotheby\u2019s International Realty    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/conjuring-12.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"A library with a reading nook -- to stay distracted, of course.\" \/>A library with a reading nook \u2014 to stay distracted, of course.Mott &amp; Chace Sotheby\u2019s International Realty    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/conjuring-14.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"The listing images aptly came with a cheeky nod to the creepy history.\" \/>The listing images aptly came with a cheeky nod to the creepy history.Mott &amp; Chace Sotheby\u2019s International Realty    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/dining-room-02.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"This photo, too, is meant to creep.\" \/>This photo, too, is meant to creep.Mott &amp; Chace Sotheby\u2019s International Realty    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/Bedroom3.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"There are three bedrooms inside.\" \/>There are three bedrooms inside.Mott &amp; Chace Sotheby\u2019s International Realty    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/Kitchen.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"The kitchen has wooden cabinets.\" \/>The kitchen has wooden cabinets.Mott &amp; Chace Sotheby\u2019s International Realty    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/living-room.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"If you're going to be haunted, you may as well feel terrified in a cozy living room with a fireplace.\" \/>If you\u2019re going to be haunted, you may as well feel terrified in a cozy living room with a fireplace.Mott &amp; Chace Sotheby\u2019s International Realty    <\/p>\n<p>Nu\u00f1ez plans to host events at the house with the Perron family, members of whom previously owned the home and operate it as a sort of learning center. Andrea Perron, 63, lived there between 1971 and 1980 and told the Journal she and her family experienced spiritual activity there.  <\/p>\n<p>For instance, during a s\u00e9ance in 1974, she saw her now-82-year-old mother, Carolyn, levitating in a chair before being thrown 20 feet from it and hitting her head on the floor. Other bizarre alleged occurrences include children seeing ghosts they believed were actual people until they vanished, witnessing a broom moving by itself across the floor, smelling an odor of rotting flesh and one child being slapped by an invisible force.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Conjuring,\u201d which became a franchise of horror films, is a fictionalized account of the Perron family and their work with paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. The original film didn\u2019t shoot in the just-sold abode \u2014 and the Perrons, at the time of their purchase, hadn\u2019t been informed of the home\u2019s dark history of murder, rape and suicide. Even the property\u2019s listing says it\u2019s rumored to be haunted by the spirit of Bathsheba Sherman, who resided there in the 19th century.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond its unusual history, the home stands on an 8.5-acre lot \u2014 and has one full bathroom and one half-bathroom, according to the listing, represented by Benjamin Kean and Ben Gugliemi, of the Blackstone Team at Mott &amp; Chace Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of the house,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez told the Journal, but also quipped: \u201cAsk me again in a year.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This Rhode Island home is simply spook-tacular \u2014 and perhaps that\u2019s why it just sold for more than its asking price.
