Knowing he wanted to be the opposite of the stereotypical 1950s father, Paul mined the web for expert parenting advice and research-backed product reviews. He found a lot of good information, but much of it was geared towards moms and didn\u2019t speak to his experience as a dad.<\/p>\n<p>Not finding online resources or community that reflected him, Paul ended up reaching out offline to another new dad, his brother-in-law, John Doht. The two swapped parenting information and found comfort in their camaraderie. Paul and John started talking about building the online resource they wished they had found when they became parents. And that\u2019s how their dad-focused parenting brand, <a href=\"https:\/\/fathercraft.com\/\">Fathercraft<\/a> was born. They launched the site in 2016, focusing on in-depth baby product reviews that weren\u2019t just informational, but funny and fun to read.<\/p>\n<p>Today, Fathercraft brings in an average of 51,000 monthly visitors to the website and gets about 52,000 monthly views on their YouTube channel. While Fathercraft is still a part-time project for Paul and John, their goal is to make it a full-time business. Adding affiliate links to reviews and selling merch on their site has provided a steady stream of income, but Paul says their online video courses, which they launched in 2018, are currently their biggest money maker.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When Paul Zalewski became a father, he went online, looking for information on how to be a dad. \u201cI literally never held a baby until my daughter was born,\u201d Paul admits.
