The Albanian international reportedly rejected a move to Old Trafford in favour of first-team football in London, following uncertainty surrounding the future of current first-choice goalkeeper David Raya, with the 26-year-old yet to accept an initial offer to extend his contract, which expires in 2024.<\/p>\n<p>20.42 BST: Wolves reject \u00a325m opening bid from Everton to sign Morgan Gibbs-White, according to Sky Sports.<\/p>\n<p>The 22-year-old academy graduate, who spent last season on loan at Sheffield United, has made 86 appearances for the Wolverhampton side.

Tuttosport says Juve are braced for a \u20ac90m offer for De Ligt from Bayern, which they would look to reinvest in Koulibaly and Roma&#8217;s attacking midfielder Nicolo Zaniolo.<\/p>\n<p>Koulibaly has made 317 appearances for Napoli since joining them in 2014 and has been linked with several clubs during that time. The Senegal defender has a year left on his contract and would bring plenty of Serie A experience to Juventus.<\/p>\n<p>16.07 BST: Sevilla are interested in signing the Tottenham Hotspur left back Sergio Reguilon, according to the Daily Mail.<\/p>\n<p>Reguilon, 25, played for Sevilla during the 2019-20 season while he was on loan from Real Madrid, before he joined Tottenham two years ago. He has made 67 appearances for the north London club since then, but he was left out of their preseason trip to South Korea.<\/p>\n<p>Now the Mail has reported that Sevilla could look to reincorporate Reguilon, with their present left-back Ludwig Augustinsson linked with a loan move to Aston Villa. They suggest that Reguilon could see his game time cut after Ivan Perisic joined from Inter Milan.<\/p>\n<p>15.28 BST: Barcelona have made Salma Paralluelo their fourth signing of the summer after confirming the arrival of the forward from Villarreal on a free transfer.<\/p>\n<p>Paralluelo, 18, has signed a contract with the Catalan club until 2026 and follows Nuria Rabano, Lucy Bronze and Geyse Ferreira in the door at Camp Nou.<\/p>\n<p>In joining Barca, Paralluelo has also had to give up athletics, where she has previously represented Spain in 400m and the 400m hurdles.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a tough to give up a sport, but it&#8217;s a step I had to take and it could not have been to come to a better club,&#8221; she told Barca&#8217;s official website. &#8220;Barca are the best team in the world. Being here is a privilege. I&#8217;m really looking forward to learning from the best players.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Paralluelo will now focus exclusively on football. She was part of the Spain squad for this summer&#8217;s European Championships in England but was forced to withdraw through injury.<\/p>\n<p>Barca won a domestic treble last season, including winning all 30 of their Primera Division matches, but were beaten in the Champions League side by Lyon.<\/p>\n<p>They have since added England international Bronze and Brazil&#8217;s Geyse &#8212; who was the top scorer in the Spanish top flight last season with Madrid CFF &#8212; to their squad following the departures of Lieke Martens and Jenni Hermoso.<\/p>\n<p>14.55 BST: Mesut Ozil has had his contract with Fenerbahce terminated by mutual consent, according to NTV Sport.<\/p>\n<p>Ozil, 33, joined the Turkish club 18 months ago after he was released by Arsenal, and went on to score eight goals and register three assists in 36 appearances for them.

The Uruguay striker said he had listened to the offers he had received from the United States, but added that he wanted to be in the best shape possible for the World Cup in Qatar.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The thing is that some possibilities are for January, I have to analyse everything,&#8221; Suarez said, after confirming that he had received multiple offers from the U.S.. &#8220;The market in MLS is very complex, some clubs want you but they don&#8217;t have the slots, and so it would have to be for January. Other clubs want you now but I have to evaluate if they have a chance to qualify for the playoffs.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not closing the door to anyone and I&#8217;ve listened to all the offers. But if some MLS teams don&#8217;t qualify for the playoffs, they end their season in the first week of October, and that&#8217;s not useful for me because I would stop for a month ahead of the World Cup, which wouldn&#8217;t be good for me.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Suarez also addressed rumours which suggested he could reunite with his close friend Messi at Inter Miami before they both retire.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;What was said about Inter Miami isn&#8217;t real, a lot of things are said in the press and on social media, but we can&#8217;t come out to deny things all the time,&#8221; Suarez said. &#8220;Leo has his future at PSG, and then I don&#8217;t know where he will want to retire. I have my sporting projects and then I&#8217;ll analyse things with my family.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We will surely end up living close to each other in Barcelona because we&#8217;re friends and our families are too, but from there to ending up together in the same sporting project is a lot of speculation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>13.14 BST: Manchester United are hopeful of pushing through a deal for Frenkie de Jong after being told the Barcelona midfielder is keen on a move to Old Trafford, the Daily Telegraph reports.<\/p>\n<p>ESPN has reported that the two clubs have reached an agreement over an initial \u20ac65m deal for De Jong, but last week Barca president Joan Laporta said the Netherlands international was &#8220;not available&#8221;. Spanish reports have said Barca want De Jong to take a pay cut, something sources have told ESPN he is unlikely to do.<\/p>\n<p>The Telegraph say that the deal has stalled because Barca owe De Jong more than \u00a317m in deferred wages and bonuses from the COVID-19 pandemic, but United have reportedly been assured that the midfielder wants to join them if that situation can be resolved.<\/p>\n<p>12.42 BST: Napoli vice-president Edoardo De Laurentiis has not closed the door to Paulo Dybala&#8217;s signing.<\/p>\n<p>Dybala, whose contract with Juventus expired last month, is a target of several clubs, including Inter Milan. Asked about the Argentina forward, De Laurentiis said: &#8220;God moves in a mysterious way.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>De Laurentiis, meanwhile, expects Belgium forward Dries Mertens and Senegal centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly to continue at the club. Mertens, the club&#8217;s all-time top scorer, has been offered a new contract with his previous deal having expired last month while Koulibaly becomes a free agent in June 2023.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We made him [Mertens] an important offer worth \u20ac2.5m net [per season],&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m convinced he will accept. Napoli has given so much and can still give him much more.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Kalidou will arrive in the coming days. We offered him \u20ac6m net for five years. More than this we can&#8217;t do.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>12.09 BST: Italian forward Mario Balotelli has hinted he may play next season in Spain.<\/p>\n<p>Balotelli joined Adana Demirspor last summer from AC Monza and is under contract with the Turkish outfit until June 2024. The former Liverpool and Manchester City player is a reported target of LaLiga side Valencia.<\/p>\n<p>Balotelli, 31, posted on his Instagram story an emoji of a Spanish flag plus one of a football and his name, Mario, and asked his followers if they would like that.<\/p>\n<p>Balotelli enjoyed a strong season in Turkey, scoring 18 goals and setting up four more in 32 games.<\/p>\n<p>11.37 BST: Andri Gudjohnsen &#8212; son of the former Chelsea and Barcelona forward Eidur &#8212; is close to leaving Real Madrid to join IFK Norrkoping, according to Expressen.<\/p>\n<p>Madrid beat Barca to Gudjohnsen&#8217;s signature when they signed Andri, now 20, for their academy in 2018.<\/p>\n<p>The striker scored four goals in 21 appearances &#8212; most of them as a substitute &#8212; for Madrid&#8217;s reserve team Castilla last season.<\/p>\n<p>The Swedish newspaper reports that Gudjohnsen would soon be presented by Norrkoping, a historic club with 13 league titles, with the final details of a four-year contract now being worked on.<\/p>\n<p>11.11 BST: Erik ten Hag has insisted Cristiano Ronaldo is not available for transfer and that he is planning on having the striker in his squad next season.<\/p>\n<p>Ten Hag revealed he had a conversation with Ronaldo before news broke that the 37-year-old wants to leave Old Trafford this summer but said the pair have not spoken since. Ronaldo has been granted time off to deal with a family issue and has not travelled to Bangkok ahead of the first game of preseason against Liverpool at the Rajamangala National Stadium on Tuesday.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not with us and it&#8217;s due to personal issues,&#8221; Ten Hag said at a news conference on Monday. &#8220;We are planning for Cristiano Ronaldo for the season and that&#8217;s it. I&#8217;m looking forward to working with him.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I have read [that he wants to leave] but what I say is Cristiano is not for sale, he is in our plans and we want success together.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I spoke with him before this issue came up, I had a conversation with him and I had a good talk. That is between Cristiano and me, what I can confirm is we had a really good conversation together.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/i\/espn\/misc_logos\/500-dark\/transfers.png\" width=\"30\" \/>10.30 BST: Paul Pogba has rejoined Juventus on a four-year contract, the club has announced, following his exit from Manchester United as a free agent last month.<\/p>\n<p>The France international enjoyed a successful first stint at the club between 2012 and 2016, winning Serie A four times in a row and and the Coppa Italia twice.<\/p>\n<p>The midfielder flew into Turin on Friday and was met with a hundreds of Juventus fans celebrating his return.

Juve spent the weekend posting plenty of picture of the France midfielder undergoing his medical, and it is expected that the 29-year-old will officially sign for them in the coming days.<\/p>\n<p>Sterling, meanwhile is reportedly waiting for the results of his medical with Chelsea before finalising his transfer to Stamford Bridge from Premier League champions City. Sources told ESPN&#8217;s James Olley last week that England international Sterling had agreed personal terms on a deal that will make him the Blues&#8217; highest-paid player. The exact transfer fee is yet to be finalised as talks continue but Sterling is expected to move for a figure in the region of \u00a345m plus add-ons.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/espnmediazone.com\/us\/files\/2018\/03\/App-Icon-Android-7.png&amp;w=126&amp;site=espnfc\" width=\"30\" \/>08.00 BST: Wayne Rooney has agreed terms to be the next manager of D.C. United, and will join up with the club once the final details are worked out and he acquires the necessary work visa, a source has confirmed to ESPN&#8217;s Jeff Carlisle.<\/p>\n<p>Rooney replaces Hernan Losada, who was fired in April. The Black-and-Red has since been under the stewardship of interim manager Chad Ashton, but the results haven&#8217;t improved, including last Friday&#8217;s 7-0 shellacking at the hands of the Philadelphia Union. DCU is currently tied with Chicago for the fewest points in Major League Soccer, with just 17 from as many matches.<\/p>\n<p>Rooney will manage the side with which he spent 15 months as a player back in 2018-19. That spell was largely viewed as successful, though there was a sense that he could have made an even bigger impact had he stuck around for the entirety of what was originally a 3\u00bd-year contract.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, Rooney returned to England to not only join Championship side Derby County as a player-coach, but also because his family had found it difficult to settle in the U.S. He eventually became Derby&#8217;s manager after Phillip Cocu was fired following a woeful start to the 2020-21 season. Under Rooney&#8217;s guidance, Derby managed to avoid relegation on the final day of the campaign.<\/p>\n<p>Matters became drastically more difficult during the 2021-22 season. Last September, the English Football League docked Derby 12 points for entering administration. The Rams were later deducted an additional nine points for breaching EFL accounting rules. While Rooney was lauded for keeping Derby competitive, the penalties proved too great, and the Rams were relegated.<\/p>\n<h2>PAPER GOSSIP (by Adam Brown)<\/h2>\n<p>&#8211; Barcelona are set to win the race to sign Raphinha, according to the Daily Mail. Leeds United have been looking for a fee of around \u00a363 million to part ways with him, and despite Chelsea having a proposal accepted, the LaLiga side have now met Leeds&#8217; valuation. The 25-year-old winger was determined to wait for the <i>Blaugrana<\/i>, having chosen them as his priority destination.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Kyle Walker-Peters is attracting interest from both Arsenal and Manchester United, reports the Athletic. While neither club are yet to advance negotiations for him, it is reported that the 25-year-old right-back is on both of their radars. He made 32 Premier League appearances last season, contributing to three goals for Southampton.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Bayern Munich will meet with Juventus this week as they look to table a bid for Matthijs De Ligt, reveals Gianluca Di Marzio. The 22-year-old centre-back has been on the radar of Manchester United and Chelsea in recent weeks but, having heard of interest from the Bundesliga champions, he is reported to be waiting for an agreement to be reached between Julian Nagelsmann&#8217;s side and the <i>Bianconeri<\/i>. It is understood that he has a release clause of \u20ac125 million.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Barcelona are set to end their interest in Bernardo Silva if they cannot move on Frenkie de Jong this summer, writes Mundo Deportivo. Division among the <i>Blaugrana <\/i>camp has seen conflicting reports surrounding the 25-year-old Netherlands international midfielder&#8217;s future, but the latest indicates that Xavi will only get one of his prime targets this summer by using the funds raised by parting ways with De Jong. Manchester City are reported to be looking for around \u20ac100 million for Silva, with the 27-year-old attacking midfielder still deemed to be an important part of Pep Guardiola&#8217;s squad.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Despite speculation linking Harry Kane with Bayern Munich, Bild understands that he is not on their shortlist this summer. Reports suggested that the Bundesliga side were eyeing the 28-year-old Tottenham Hotspur striker as a replacement for Robert Lewandowski, who is expected to leave the Allianz Arena. Having been linked with an exit from north London last season, Kane is understood to now be happy at the club following Antonio Conte&#8217;s appointment.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ousmane Dembele appears set to finally agree to a new contract with Barcelona.\u00a0Quality Sport Images\/Getty Images)The summer transfer window is here, and there&#8217;s plenty of gossip swirling about who&#8217;s moving where.
