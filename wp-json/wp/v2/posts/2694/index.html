Yet for many years it was all but unknown in America.<\/p>\n<p>But reality TV changed all that.<\/p>\n<p>Since the Netflix series \u201cDrive to Survive\u201d \u2014\u00a0featuring behind-the-scenes footage of the usually-secretive racing teams and the sometimes contentious relationships between drivers and team executives \u2014 debuted in 2019, the American audience for Formula 1 has skyrocketed.<\/p>\n<p>Netflix doesn\u2019t publicize viewer data, but the audience for ESPN\u2019s coverage of Formula 1 races has nearly doubled \u2014\u00a0up to 1.5 million views per race\u00a0\u2014 since the show premiered.<\/p>\n<p>According to a recent Nielsen study, Formula 1 is on track to top a billion worldwide fans this year, with 77 percent of those new fans under 35 years old.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWithout \u2018Drive to Survive\u2019 there would be no American F1 boom,\u201d Kevin Clark, host of The Ringer\u2019s F1 Show, told The Post. When his podcast started, the idea was to recap episodes of the binge-worthy show and preview each of the 22 races in the sport\u2019s season. The success of the podcast caught him and the staff of The Ringer, a popular sports and pop culture site, by surprise, however. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/lewis-hamilton-max-verstappen-pierre-gasly-masashi-yamaoto.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Drivers like Lewis Hamilton (from left), Max Verstappen and Pierre Gasly (with Honda F1 General Manager Masahi Yamamoto) have become stars in America.\" \/>Drivers like Lewis Hamilton (from left), Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez (with Honda F1 General Manager Masahi Yamamoto) have become stars in America.Icon Sportswire via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen we saw the numbers, we saw the reaction,\u201d Clark said. \u201cWe knew this wasn\u2019t going to be a part time thing. We tapped into something.\u201d According to the podcast rankings at Chartable, The Ringer F1 Show is regularly among the top 50 sports podcasts in the United States.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Formula 1 has gotten so big that Sun., May 8, marks the inaugural Miami Grand Prix, which will be run in the Hard Rock Stadium \u2014\u00a0complete with a makeshift Monaco-style marina for yachts built just for the occasion \u2014\u00a0and has ticket prices rivaling the Super Bowl. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou look at Formula 1 and it\u2019s healthier than it\u2019s ever been before. We\u2019re selling sold-out tickets, so far, everywhere, and I think it\u2019s going to continue the whole of this year,\u201d driver Alex Albon \u2014\u00a0a \u201cDrive to Survive\u201d star \u2014 told Page Six during the Williams Racing launch party at the W Hotel South Beach on Thursday.<\/p>\n<p>In another sign that \u201cDrive to Survive\u201d is fueling the new American Formula 1 fandom, the Miami Grand Prix driver\u2019s parade \u2014 a pre-race tradition of the sport where drivers travel the circuit out of their cars so fans can see them up close and personal \u2014 will, for the first time, include Team Principals, the executives who have become celebrities on the show.<\/p>\n<p>Miami is actually the second American race: The US Grand Prix, run in Austin, Texas, since 2012, saw a 15 percent increase in attendance in the first year of \u201cDrive to Survive,\u201d with 250,000 fans attending the race \u2014 a number on par with a typical Kentucky Derby crowd. In 2021, that number had grown to over 400,000, making it the largest crowd at a Formula 1 race anywhere in the world, ever.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/daniel-ricciardo.jpg?w=682\" alt=\"Drivers like Daniel Ricciardo and Lando Norris have lots to celebrate, with F1 finally welcoming young fans.\" \/>Drivers like Daniel Ricciardo and Lando Norris have lots to celebrate, with F1 finally welcoming young fans.Formula 1 via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>Next year there are plans to add a third American stop and race cars down the Las Vegas Strip.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI started watching \u2018Drive to Survive\u2019 three months ago and I went from actively disliking motorsports to being obsessed with F1. I read about it every day, I\u2019m on the Reddit every day, I text about it every day, I think about it every day,\u201d television writer Travis Helwig, 34, told The Post. \u201cLike most sports, the best part is the narrative, and Formula 1 lends itself to the drama and narrative well. There\u2019s only 20 participants, so it\u2019s easy to learn every participant\u2019s story.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>American-based Liberty Media Group purchased Formula 1 for $4.4 billion in 2016  and partnered with Netflix in a radical departure from anything the brand had done before.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDrive to Survive\u201d is unique, according to Clark, even among sports reality shows. While HBO\u2019s NFL reality series \u201cHard Knocks\u201d gives the NFL final say over what is broadcast, Netflix has no such agreement with Formula 1, <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/travis-helwig-alexis-novak.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"New fan Alexis Novak compares the \u201cDrive to Survive\u201d drama to \u201cReal Housewives,\u201d while Travis Helwig said he\u2019s become addicated to the point that he reads about the sport every day.\" \/>New fan Travis Helwig said he\u2019s become addicted to the point that he reads about the sport every day, while Alexis Novak compares the \u201cDrive to Survive\u201d drama to \u201cReal Housewives.\u201d    <\/p>\n<p>The result, Clark added, is a much more revealing and entertaining show, and one that draws in fans who not only never watched Formula 1 before, but never even watched sports at all. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cReality shows \u2014 even if you think they take away from the competitive element, even if you think that it makes a mockery of the sport \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s the easiest way to create superstars,\u201d Clark said. \u201cTens of millions of people have watched \u2018Drive to Survive.\u2019 And there are so many people who did not like sports who are now watching this every single weekend.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe switch between how F1 markets itself is an entertainment product was a huge inflection point in the sport.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t care about F1 at all. After watching \u2018Drive to Survive,\u2019 I will now teach my [future] children about F1,\u201d said Alexis Novak, 31, the founder of the online clothing store Tab Vintage. \u201cIt made me feel giddy and made me want to follow and support my favorite drivers like I used to with boy bands.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/forumla-1-drive-to-survive-01.jpg?w=1024\" \/>Netflix has announced at least two more seasons of \u201cDrive to Survive\u201dNetflix    <\/p>\n<p>For Novak, who says she has always \u201cactively disliked sports,\u201d \u201cDrive to Survive\u201d made Formula 1 seem different. \u201cIt\u2019s not like other sports because you get to know the people in the cars, the people working on the cars, and the owners. You get to see the politics behind the races too,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect crossover of culture, wealth, fame, adrenaline and drama \u2014like the \u2018Real Housewives\u2019 meets the Super Bowl.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Former Formula 1 chief executive Bernie Ecclestone was famously dismissive of younger fans.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why people want to get to the so-called \u2018young generation,\u2019\u201d Ecclestone told Campaign Asia-Pacific magazine in 2014. \u201cWhy do they want to do that? Is it to sell them something? Most of these kids haven\u2019t got any money. I\u2019d rather get to the 70-year-old guy who\u2019s got plenty of cash.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>The impact of the growing American audience is being felt around the world, too. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cForty percent of our audience is from the US now, and only 25 percent is from the UK,\u201d said BBC radio presenter Richard Ready, host of the Formula 1 podcast \u201cMissed Apex.\u201d \u201cSo if people want to get snobby about \u2018Drive to Survive\u2019 fans, they have to kind of realize they\u2019re a bit outnumbered now.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/lewis-hamilton.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Lewis Hamilton is a major star of the sport.\" \/>Lewis Hamilton is a major star of the sport.Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>Ready is referring to a growing concern, particularly among some European fans of the sport, that these new fans are going to \u201cAmericanize\u201d it: putting an emphasis on personalities, exaggerating rivalries and minor disputes and fulfilling the American need for all sporting contests to be dramatic and decisive.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAmericans cannot abide a tie,\u201d Ready says. \u201cFormula 1, to me, is sometimes special because nothing happens. And that might be a British thing or a European thing. In soccer, we don\u2019t mind the odd boring draw \u2026 If you force the spectacular all the time, it\u2019s like having birthday cake every day. So when your birthday comes around, is it that special?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The fear that playing to the American audience\u2019s appetite for drama came to a boil in last year\u2019s final race in Abu Dhabi, where the two top drivers were tied in points for the championship. After it looked like the race would be decisively won by reigning champion Lewis Hamilton, a controversial decision by the Race Director Michael Masi allowed challenger Max Verstappen to close the gap and win in the final lap of the race. <\/p>\n<p>The result was a thrilling neck-and-neck finish, but longtime fans of Formula 1 cried foul, saying Masi broke the rules. An investigation by the FIA, Formula 1\u2019s governing body, found that Masi\u2019s decision was the result of \u201chuman error\u201d and he was replaced as Race Director. Many fans wondered if that error was the invisible hand of Netflix guiding the race results.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/max-verstappen.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"A controversial decision by the Race Director Michael Masi allowed challenger Max Verstappen to close the gap and win in the final lap of a race. \" \/>A controversial decision by the Race Director Michael Masi allowed challenger Max Verstappen above) to close the gap and win in the final lap of a race. Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere was already a suspicion going into that, that there\u2019s been a Netflix-ization of the sport,\u201d said Clark. \u201cI think what you saw in Abu Dhabi was just general run of the mill incompetence, but because there was already a skepticism among diehard fans, you saw more theories about that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI do not see that as a conspiracy theory,\u201d Ready arued. \u201cI see it as very plausible.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Netflix just confirmed confirmed two more seasons of \u201cDrive to Survive,\u201d and producers have been spotted at Formula 1 races this season. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cFormula 1 now, I have to say, is an American sport,\u201d Ready admitted. \u201cAnd as much as the things that are coming in from the US might be jarring to us, F1 did need them.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With more than 400 million viewers, Formula 1 is one of the most popular sports in the world.
