A year later, Minnelli won a Tony for \u201cFlora the Red Menace.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She released a slew of records \u2014 usually standards and songs from musicals \u2014 and acted in such films as \u201cNew York, New York\u201d (the title song would become her signature number) and \u201cTell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon.\u201d That one was notable because a nude scene filmed in a Massachusetts graveyard led to what was known as the \u201cLiza Minnelli Bill\u201d and prohibited filming in that state\u2019s cemeteries without permission.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/liza-minnelli-judy-garland-vincente-minnelli-02.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Minnelli is the daughter of actress Judy Garland and director Vincente Minnelli.\" \/>Minnelli is the daughter of actress Judy Garland and director Vincente Minnelli.Bettmann Archive    <\/p>\n<p>Her role as the tragic Sally Bowles in \u201cCabaret\u201d would sear her gamine image into pop-culture history, and her TV special \u201cLiza With A \u2018Z&#8217;\u201d meant no one would mispronounce her name again.<\/p>\n<p>She is just one of a handful of people to win an EGOT \u2014 an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony \u2014 although Gorenstein pointed out that the Kennedy Center has yet to bestow an honor on her, which has created online grumbling from her fans for years.<\/p>\n<p>But Minnelli\u2019s life has been marked by pain.
