But now he&#8217;s on his way to Major League Soccer &#8230; with LAFC!<\/p>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p>The most expensive player of all time in 2013, when he made the move from Tottenham Hotspur to Real Madrid for \u20ac100 million ($106m), Bale&#8217;s career in Spain has been filled with trophies (including five Champions Leagues, three LaLiga titles, three UEFA Super Cups and one Copa del Rey) and controversy (mainly over his injury record, perceived lack of commitment to the club and love of golf.)<\/p>\n<p>With his contract &#8212; which cost the club around \u20ac60m a season, making him one of the five highest-paid players in the world &#8212; expiring this summer, sources had told ESPN that the 32-year-old had been prepared to retire from football if Wales had failed to reach the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. But Wales beat Ukraine 1-0 to seal the final UEFA spot in the playoffs and will open their tournament against the United States on Nov. 21.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, Bale needed a new club side to maintain his fitness until November and was linked with a return to Wales with Cardiff City in the English Championship.<\/p>\n<p>But the lure of Los Angeles loomed and Bale opted to move to the City of Angels, following veteran Italy and Juventus defender Giorgio Chiellini, who did so earlier this month.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how how social media reacted to the news and also a look at Bale&#8217;s impact on the game.<\/p>\n<p><b>&#8211; Stream ESPN FC Daily on ESPN+ (U.S. only)<\/b><br \/>&#8211; Don&#8217;t have ESPN?
