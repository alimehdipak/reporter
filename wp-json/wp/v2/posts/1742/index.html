I loved the idea of taking young trained dancers, and asking them to ask one of their untrained parents to dance with them. I was similar to a lot of these kids, I was dancing nonstop, and it was my life,\u201d Dewan, 41, told The Post.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI know what it\u2019s like to be a diehard dancer as a kid. But I also know what it\u2019s like to be the parent who would do anything for her kids,\u201d she said. \u201cI could see it in their eyes [in the show], how much the parents wanted to impress us and be there for their kids. I get it. It was super-fun, but hard for me to judge, because my heart was so invested in their journey.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"835\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/come-dance-with-me-12.jpg?w=835\" alt=\"Jenna Dewan smiles in a shiny orange dress. \" \/>Jenna Dewan as a judge on the new parent-child dance competition series \u201cCome Dance with Me.\u201d CBS    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/come-dance-with-me-3.jpg?w=1024\" \/>Mother and son duo Lucas and Carolina take the stage in \u201cCome Dance with Me.\u201d CBS    <\/p>\n<p>In \u201cCome Dance With Me\u201d (Fridays at 8 p.m.) is hosted by Grammy-winning songwriter Philip Lawrence \u2014 best known for his collaborations with Bruno Mars \u2014 with judges Dewan, Dexter Mayfield and Tricia Miranda.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In each episode, a young trained dancer (between the ages of 8 and 15) taps one of their dance-novice parents to join them on stage, performing a choreographed number for the panel of judges. They\u2019re evaluated based on technique, team chemistry and showmanship. Each week, parent\/child duos are eliminated until the last pair standing wins a $100,000 grand prize.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was drawn to the courage that it takes for these parents to say yes,\u201d said Lawrence, 41, who has won seven Grammys and garnered 18 nominations.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/come-dance-with-me-13.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Philip Lawrence stands on a stage holding a mic and smiling. \" \/>Grammy-winner Philip Lawrence hosts \u201cCome Dance With Me.\u201d CBS    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/come-dance-with-me-8.jpg?w=1024\" \/>Emelyn, 13, dances with her novice mom, Nicole, on \u201cCome Dance with Me.\u201d CBS    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/come-dance-with-me-6.jpg?w=1024\" \/>Ava, 10, dances with her novice dad, John, on \u201cCome Dance with Me.\u201d CBS    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been watching from the sidelines, supporting their kids\u2019 dreams, and they\u2019re now thrust into that arena when they\u2019ve had none of that training.
