Notably, the ability to \u201cfly, fly away\u201d across galactic graphics at many of the saga\u2019s legendary locations is reportedly unmatched.<\/p>\n<p>However, although fans are instantly loving the new release, the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise\u2019s original Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) might not be so thrilled to discover it includes a years-old meme he has previously denounced. <\/p>\n<p>The infamous meme moment documents Obi-Wan Kenobi handing Luke his father\u2019s lightsaber for the first time. Luke proceeds to aim it at his face \u2014 as though he is staring down the barrel of a gun. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis makes me cringe every time I see it,\u201d Hamill, 70, tweeted last March. \u201cI don\u2019t remember doing this in the movie. I think it\u2019s just an on-set production still, otherwise Obi-Wan wouldn\u2019t look so remarkably unconcerned.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>This makes me cringe every time I see it. <\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t remember doing this in the movie.
