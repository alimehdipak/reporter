His distraught pseudo-daughter, Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown), went with the Byers family as Joyce (Winona Ryder), Will (Noah Schnapp) and Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) left Hawkins, Indiana for less-dangerous pastures. Steve (Joe Keery) made a new friend in Robin (Maya Hawke). And Billy (Dacre Montgomery), the bully, died.<\/p>\n<p>Season 4, premiering Friday (Volume 2 drops in July) picks up more or less from the Season 3 finale. It\u2019s 1986, and Hopper is having a bad time. The Byers and Eleven are living in California. Eleven and Mike (Finn Wolfhard) are still going strong in their relationship (albeit long-distance) while Eleven is being bullied in school. Joyce (Winona Ryder) has a new job and is stressing about Jonathan getting into college. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/stranger-things-season-4-4.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" \/>Erica (Priah Ferguson), Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo), Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) in \u201cStranger Things\u201d Season 4.

Courtesy of Netflix    <\/p>\n<p>Back in Hawkins, Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) and Mike are as nerdy as ever, which puts them at odds with Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin), who\u2019s trying to get into the popular jock crowd. Max (Sadie Sink) is lost after her brother Billy\u2019s death. Nancy (Natalia Dyer) is putting her investigative skills to use at the school newspaper, and Steve and Robin are best friends, crushing on girls together. And of course, there\u2019s a scary new monster in town.<\/p>\n<p>If that sounds like a laundry list, it feels a bit like that onscreen, too. The show has become more epic and sprawling than ever, and that\u2019s not necessarily a good thing. It creates bloated episodes and plotlines that vary wildly in quality. Poor Joyce feels borderline irrelevant, while Hopper, who used to be the heart of the show, is stuck in a thankless subplot that feels like it\u2019s wasting Harbour\u2019s talent. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/stranger-things-season-4-11.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"David Harbour scowls in a Russian hat. \" \/>Hopper (David Harbour) in \u201cStranger Things\u201d Season 4.

Similarly, Eleven\u2019s struggles with her powers were interesting, but they were emphasized when we watched her play off of Hopper, the two lonely misfits fulfilling a need in each other for a father-daughter relationship.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/stranger-things-season-4-7.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Winona Ryder holds a phone and looks worried. \" \/>Joyce Byers (Winona Ryder) in \u201cStranger Things\u201d Season 4.

Courtesy of Netflix    <\/p>\n<p>Season 4 doesn\u2019t ditch its humanity and there are  still some fun moments including characters shooting the breeze with each other (especially Steve and Robin). But with its main cast members scattered to the wind \u2014 and Hopper and Joyce feeling less relevant \u2014 \u201cStranger Things\u201d feels like it\u2019s lost some of its heart. <\/p>\n<p>Because of the three-year hiatus, it also feels nearly like parody, how old the young cast now looks. Will seems at least 17, where in previous seasons, he looked 12. This isn\u2019t Schnapp\u2019s fault, but it <em>is <\/em>the show\u2019s fault for not accommodating it. It would have been easy for the story to simply write in a bigger time jump between Seasons 3 and 4, allowing the young characters to age more naturally.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s still a lot to enjoy about Season 4, and \u201cStranger Things\u201d remains an entertaining show.\u00a0But, it also feels like it\u2019s biting off more than it can chew. \u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Everything is turning upside-down. \u201cStranger Things\u201d is back after three years and the Netflix hit is bigger than ever \u2014 but it\u2019s a mixed bag in its penultimate season.
