Which of the two is more involved in disrupting sleep has been a long-disputed question, with most researchers crediting the sleep problems to beta-amyloid accumulation.<\/p>\n<p>During sleep, the brain clears out the beta amyloid that accumulates during the day. When we can&#8217;t sleep, it builds up. So, Neylan said, since the PSP patients never sleep, she expected to see lots of the protein in their brains.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;But it turns out that they have none,&#8221; he said. &#8220;These findings confirm with direct evidence that tau is a critical driver of sleep disturbances.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In patients with PSP, said Grinberg, this understanding turned the treatment paradigm on its head.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We see that these patients can&#8217;t sleep because there is nothing telling the &#8220;awake&#8221; neurons to shut down,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Now, rather than trying to induce these people to sleep, the idea is to shut down the system that&#8217;s keeping them awake.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Clinical Trial is Giving Patients Hope<\/p>\n<p>That idea is currently being tested in a clinical trial of patients with PSP, using a treatment that specifically targets the overactive &#8216;awake&#8217; system that keeps these patients from sleeping. This approach contrasts with the traditional trial-and-error treatment with sleep medications.<\/p>\n<p>At the helm of that trial is Christine Walsh, PhD, the study&#8217;s other lead author, who has also worked on the study for a decade. Noting that PSP and Alzheimer&#8217;s are at opposite ends of the sleep-disturbance spectrum, she said she expects the research to lead to new ways of treating sleep disturbances driven by neurodegeneration.<\/p>\n<p>Treatments for Alzheimer&#8217;s could be adjusted depending on the patient&#8217;s needs, bumping up the &#8220;awake&#8221; system while tamping down the &#8220;sleep&#8221; system, said Walsh, who along with Grinberg, is a member of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences.<\/p>\n<p>The PSP trial is still underway, and Walsh is highly optimistic that this new approach will have better results than current medications for people with either condition. Based on the findings of the study published today, she said, &#8220;We&#8217;re even more hopeful that we can actually make a difference in the lives of these patients.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedaily.com\/releases\/2022\/04\/220404120516.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The lethargy that many Alzheimer&#8217;s patients experience is caused not by a lack of sleep, but rather by the degeneration of a type of neuron that keeps us awake, according to a&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":1430,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[9],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1429"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/7"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1429"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1429\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1429"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1429"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1429"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
