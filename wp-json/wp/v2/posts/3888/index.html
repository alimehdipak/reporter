At several points he attempted to hold the device with both hands as he spoke to his rapt audience. <\/p>\n<p>Hanks \u2014 who co-stars as svengali Colonel Tom Parker opposite Austin Butler\u2019s Elvis in Baz Luhrmann\u2019s controversial biopic \u2014 didn\u2019t make mention of his obvious tremor as he addressed the crowd. <\/p>\n<p>Reps for Hanks\u2019 camp have yet to respond to The Post\u2019s request for comment. However, fans of the \u201cForrest Gump\u201d icon have flocked to social media saying international speculation about his health is inaccurate \u2014 and\u00a0inappropriate. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s still one of the best actors left \u2026 his health is his business,\u201d one declared.  <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/tom-hanks-shake-comp.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" \/>Fans have expressed concern about Tom Hanks\u2019 health after the actor was seen shaking onstage at the Australian premiere of \u201cElvis.\u201d    <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/tom-hanks-shake-004.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"618\" height=\"411\" \/>The 65-year-old actor moved the mike back and forth between his shaking hands as he spoke to the crowd.

The actor was one of the first public figures to test positive for the coronavirus in March 2020, while he was filming \u201cElvis\u201d in Australia. <\/p>\n<p>Still another passionate defender said the enduring star\u2019s unsteady hands could likely be due to his diabetes and shouldn\u2019t be cause for alarm. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s diabetic.

Backgrid    <\/p>\n<p>Hanks later told Radio Times that he was a \u201ctotal idiot\u201d about his self-care: \u201cI\u2019m part of the lazy American generation that has blindly kept dancing through the party and now finds ourselves with a malady,\u201d he said. \u201cI was heavy.
