Why critics say ads, spam sites are killing search\"><\/p>\n<p>Is Google search getting worse? From viral TikTok videos to posts on techie forums, frustrated users seem to think so.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>They say that Google\u2019s search results are increasingly stuffed with paid ads \u2014 and argue that spam sites are getting better at pushing themselves up in search results by gaming the company\u2019s algorithms.<\/p>\n<p>The end result is that Google\u2019s search is gradually deteriorating, critics say, becoming less helpful and more annoying even as it remains the primary tool more than 4 billion people use to search the internet. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve tried to search for a recipe or product review recently, I don\u2019t need to tell you that Google search results have gone to s\u2014t,\u201d Dmitri Kyle Brereton, a software engineer and writer, wrote in a blog post that rocketed to the top of influential Silicon Valley forum Hacker News in February. \u201cGoogle is dead.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2>Ads and spam<\/h2>\n<p>For example, imagine someone who works from home is looking for a new laptop.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>If they go to Google and search \u201cbest laptop for working from home,\u201d ads for Microsoft, LG and Capital One take up the entire screen. Scroll down past yet another ad for Dell, and they\u2019ll reach the first non-sponsored link to a bizarre website called corporateshields.com.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"535\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/google-4.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Google search results\" \/>Google search results for some queries are overrun with ads.     <\/p>\n<p>The article, which is written by a faceless author named Patricia and is itself overrun with advertisements, appears to have gamed Google\u2019s algorithm by repeating keywords over and over again, including the phrase \u201claptop\u201d 155 times, \u201cremote work\u201d 14 times and \u201cworking from home\u201d 10 times.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>This process \u2014 called search engine optimization, or SEO \u2014 can result in awkward, robotic sentences that repeat key phrases.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWorking remotely from home is more common than ever before, requiring a high-quality laptop computer,\u201d the article reads. \u201cTheir prices range from hundreds to thousands. So, how do you find the best laptops for remote work?\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The second, third and fourth Google search results are also no-name sites that use keywords over and over again. While the products on the sites are real, there\u2019s little evidence that the articles are being created by real writers with any other goal than to hoard traffic by gaming Google\u2019s system.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe first few non-ad results are SEO optimized sites filled with affiliate links and ads,\u201d Brereton, the Google critic, wrote. \u201cTo be fair, this would probably be an issue with any search engine, but you\u2019d expect Google to be able to come up with a less gameable algorithm.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In addition, critics argued that Google is upping the amount of ads that appear in search results.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve dialed [ads] up to the max recently to squeeze out every last cent before their inevitable collapse,\u201d he said.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In a statement to The Post, a Google spokesperson argued that \u201cthe quality of Google Search has drastically improved over time.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>\u201cEvery year, we make thousands of improvements to Google, and our testing gives us clear evidence that these changes truly make Search better for people,\u201d the spokesperson added. \u201cOver the last seven years, we decreased irrelevant results by over 50%.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Google also said that it\u2019s made improvements to how it ranks search results, including product reviews, and said that ads have not appeared on 80% of search result pages on average over the past four years. <\/p>\n<p>Even Brereton admits that Google searches for factual questions \u2014 like, for example, \u201cwhat was the population of London in 1700\u201d \u2014 are \u201cabsolutely amazing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve built the best question-answer system ever,\u201d Brereton told The Post. \u201cBut for everything else, like regular web results, that\u2019s where the issue is.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, foresaw problems with advertising when they first created the search engine in 1998 . <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers,\u201d Page and Brin wrote in a 1998 paper while PhD students at Stanford University, warning of the model\u2019s \u201cmixed incentives.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Yet Page and Brin nonetheless started selling ads alongside their search results in the year 2000 and Google\u2019s ad business has ballooned ever since. Ads across Google\u2019s network \u2014 which includes YouTube and ad placements on third-party sites \u2014 brought in a whopping $54 billion in revenue during the first quarter of 2022 alone. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/google-2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Google \" \/>Critics say that search engine optimization techniques and ads have made Google search worse. NurPhoto via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<h2>Reddit\u00a0<\/h2>\n<p>Some frustrated Google users have found a way around spotty results: adding \u201cReddit\u201d to the end of their searches.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The popular forum\u2019s name often crops up in the Google search suggestion box \u2014 and a TikTok video about the trend racked up more than 100,000 likes in April.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the only way to avoid trying to find the answer in a blog post full of ads,\u201d the top comment on the video reads.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI thought I was weird for doing this,\u201d another top commenter said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know so many others did it.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/reddit-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Reddit\" \/>Some users say adding \u201cReddit\u201d to the end of their Google searches helps them get better results. SOPA Images\/LightRocket via Gett    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt literally gives better answers than google,\u201d a third said.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Brereton argues that adding \u201cReddit\u201d to searches helps filter out \u201cfake\u201d parts of the internet, such as spam sites. Google searches that include the word also often have fewer ads. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe SEO marketers gaming their way to the top of every Google search result might as well be robots,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEverything is commercialized. Someone\u2019s always trying to sell you something. Whether they\u2019re a bot or human, they are decidedly fake.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>And while Reddit posts might lie, people can at least reasonably assume they come from real people.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHow can we regain authenticity?\u201d Brereton wrote. \u201cYou append \u2018reddit\u2019 to your query.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Reached for comment, Reddit spokesperson Courtney Geesey-Dorr declined to comment on Google but said that Reddit has upgraded search options on its own site.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Asked about potential Google alternatives, Brereton told The Post that Bing and DuckDuckGo suffer from many of the same problems as Google, such as algorithm-gaming spam and ads. He said the most exciting new alternatives are sites called\u00a0Neeva, Brave and You.com.<\/p>\n<p>But Google\u2019s vice-like grip on the search market makes it difficult for a competitor to emerge, he added. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe alternative can\u2019t just be two times better, it needs to be so much better that it\u2019s worth the inconvenience of switching,\u201d Brereton told The Post. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Is Google search getting worse?
