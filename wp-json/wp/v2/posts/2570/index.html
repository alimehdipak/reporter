Some people might suggest reading the manga first, as it is the original source material for the anime adaptation. Others might say to watch the anime first and then read the manga, as the anime can provide a helpful introduction to the story. Ultimately, it\u2019s up to you to decide what order you want to experience Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure in.<\/p>\n<p>If you do choose to watch the anime first, we would recommend starting with Part 1: Phantom Blood. This is the section of the story that the anime adapts, and it will give you a good idea of what the overall series is like. After watching Phantom Blood, you can then move on to reading Part 2: Battle Tendency \u2013 which is currently ongoing in Shueisha\u2019s Ultra Jump magazine. Of course, you can always read the manga in any order you like \u2013 but we think this is a good place to start.<\/p>\n<h3>How would you rank each part of JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure, from least favorite to favorite, and why?<\/h3>\n<p>There is no easy answer to this question. It depends on what you are looking for in a story and how you prefer to consume it. Both the JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure anime and manga are excellent examples of their respective mediums, so it really comes down to personal preference.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to experience the story at a faster pace and with more visual flair, then the anime is probably the better option. It condenses the story down to its most essential plot points and presents them in an exciting and stylish way. Plus, the voice acting and music are top-notch, making it a truly immersive experience.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you prefer a more detailed and leisurely paced story, then the manga is probably a better fit. It goes into much greater depth than the anime, exploring the characters and their motivations in greater detail. Plus, there\u2019s something to be said for being able to sit down and read a story at your own pace.<\/p>\n<p>So, in the end, it really comes down to what you are looking for in a story and how you prefer to consume it. If you want a fast-paced and visually exciting experience, go with the anime. If you prefer a more detailed and leisurely paced story, go with the manga.<\/p>\n<h3>Why did Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure become so popular?<\/h3>\n<p>There are many reasons why Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure became such a popular anime and manga series.
