It\u2019s not been published yet, but it does exist and we\u2019re working on it right now,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"868\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/extinct-dodo-return-04.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" \/>This early 20th-century illustration of a dodo was made by Lionel Walter Rothschild about 200 years after the bird went extinct.Getty Images   \t \t   <\/p>\n<p>The 3-foot-tall flightless bird was first recorded in modern history by Dutch sailors on the island of Mauritius, east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, in 1598. By the late 17th century, not a trace of the dodo could be found there \u2014 and was presumed to have been wiped out by invasive species, including dogs, cats and humans <\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s been a buzz in the evolutionary research community about the potential to recreate other prehistoric species, such as the wooly mammoth which died out around 4,000 years ago. Scientists have teased the plan since its complete genome was sequenced in 2015.<\/p>\n<p>That same year, Shapiro\u2019s book \u201cHow To Clone A Mammoth\u201d (Princeton University Press) revealed her dodo de-extinction aspirations: \u201cMore than any other species [the dodo] is the international symbol of human-caused extinction,\u201d she wrote. <\/p>\n<p>But bringing back the dodo poses unique challenges, Shapiro told Royal Society attendees.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/extinct-dodo-return-02.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"dodo skeleton\" \/>This \u201cSummers Place Dodo\u201d skeleton dates back to the 16th century, just before the species went extinct.Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cMammals are simpler,\u201d she said, made possible by cloning \u2014 \u201cthe same approach that was used to create Dolly the Sheep.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>\u201cBut we don\u2019t know how to do that with birds because of the intricacies of their reproductive pathways.
