He had said he had planned to return to the ring, but was also wholly committed to promoting the Katie Taylor-Amanda Serrano undisputed lightweight title fight in Madison Square Garden, which took place Saturday night. Paul was in attendance for the split decision win for Taylor over his fighter, Serrano.<\/p>\n<p>Now, Paul will come back on his own after his first break following fighting four times in 11 months from November 2020 until January 2021.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Back in the gym, back to training and excited, more excited and motivated than ever,&#8221; Paul told ESPN back in March. &#8220;You know, that was Chapter 1 of my boxing career, that was my rookie season and now I get to go on another chapter here.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Paul said in March he wasn&#8217;t sure who he would fight next or when, exactly, the fight would be. Initially, after his win in December over Woodley, he said he wasn&#8217;t going to fight for 18 months because he felt burned out.<\/p>\n<p>He said in March he was looking at things pessimistically then because he had been in a constant training camp-fight rotation. Plus, he had his other business ventures as well. Two months into his break, he realized how much he loved fighting and decided to start training again.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It was like two months in, I was like, I was sitting there and I had an epiphany,&#8221; Paul said in March. &#8220;I was like, &#8216;I feel motivated again.
