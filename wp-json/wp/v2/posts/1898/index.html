With enough signatures, the group can petition the National Labor Relations Board to hold a formal union election for the Grand Central location.<\/p>\n<p>In a post on their website, the organizers said they had voted to become an affiliate of the labor group Workers United on Feb. 21 ahead of the signature drive.
