Mark Ogden and Ryan O&#8217;Hanlon are here to sort through the noise and give you some answers.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pogba&#8217;s six seasons at Manchester United were among the most polarizing in recent memory. A large and loud subsection of the commentariat have held Pogba up as a symbol for everything that&#8217;s wrong with the once-great club. Meanwhile, others see one of the most talented soccer players in the world, a domineering midfielder who&#8217;s flourished everywhere else he&#8217;s been, simply unable to overcome all the dysfunction around him.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, Pogba was supposed to be a transformative signing for United &#8212; a world-record transfer that proved that the best players in the world still wanted to play at Old Trafford and who showed that the club would be challenging for major titles once again. Instead, with Pogba at the club, United never seriously challenged for the Premier League and reached the Champions League quarter finals just once.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>14.30 BST: Chicago Fire and the U.S. U20&#8217;s goalkeeping phenom Gabriel Slonina has been linked with the Champions League winners.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/soccer\/blog-transfer-talk\/story\/4678522\/\" \/>play<\/p>\n<p>1:22<\/p>\n<p>Herculez Gomez speaks about Gabriel Slonina&#8217;s potential transfer from Chicago Fire to Real Madrid.<\/p>\n<p>13.49 BST: Aston Villa have already signed Boubacar Kamara, Diego Carlos and Philippe Coutinho, but The Athletic says the club want three more new arrivals.<\/p>\n<p>The report claims: &#8220;The club are looking for another left-sided defender, a midfielder and a new striker, with free agent Luis Suarez still under consideration.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Suarez, 35, will leave Atletico Madrid on a free transfer this summer and could be tempted to join his former Liverpool teammate Steven Gerrard, who is now manager at Villa.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/espnmediazone.com\/us\/files\/2018\/03\/App-Icon-Android-7.png&amp;w=126&amp;site=espnfc\" width=\"30\" \/>13.05 BST: ICYMI &#8211; Barcelona will seek approval from the club&#8217;s members for a cash injection of up to \u20ac700m to help overhaul the squad this summer, sources have confirmed to ESPN.<\/p>\n<p>The Catalan club announced on Tuesday that they will hold an extraordinary assembly on June 16 for members to vote on the potential sales of Barca Licensing &amp; Merchandising [BLM] and future television rights.<\/p>\n<p>Barca say they want &#8220;authorisation for the acquisition by one or more investors of a minority stake in the social capital of the BLM business (up to 49.9%).&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>They are also asking for members to allow them to sell &#8220;up to 25% of income for the exploitation of television rights corresponding to [LaLiga] to one or more investors.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Members will be provided with more information on June 3 and then, 13 days later, will be able to vote electronically on whether to grant the club permission to sell off the assets.<\/p>\n<p>Sources have told ESPN the sale of a stake in BLM could bring in around \u20ac200m, while the club&#8217;s television rights could bring in as much as \u20ac500m depending on the final terms and lengths of the potential deals.<\/p>\n<p>12.45 BST: Liverpool are suddenly being linked with a lot of players&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>The Daily Mail claims Watford&#8217;s Joao Pedro could be a possible replacement for Sadio Mane.<\/p>\n<p>Pedro, 20, still has three years left on his contract, after joining the club in January of 2020, but Watford were relegated this season and he could move on.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/i\/espn\/misc_logos\/500-dark\/transfers.png\" width=\"30\" \/>12.03 BST: Paul Pogba will leave Manchester United when his contract expires at the end of June, the club announced on Wednesday.<\/p>\n<p>The France international will depart Old Trafford on a free transfer for the second time after joining Juventus in 2012.<\/p>\n<p>A club statement read: &#8220;The club can announce that Paul Pogba will leave Manchester United at the end of June, upon the expiry of his contract.

It is expected that only a loan move would be possible financially, while any transfer would reportedly need to be completed by July to take advantage of tax breaks.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly is eyeing a summer move with Barcelona his favoured destination, according Diario Sport. The centre-back has one year left on his contract and his wish is to leave in a mutually beneficial transfer due to his long-standing relationship with the Serie A club, rather than leaving as a free agent in 2023. Barcelona are aware of they are Koulibaly&#8217;s No. 1 choice, but they have not yet made a move as they are waiting to see what Napoli do. While Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Juventus have all made an effort to start talks, Camp Nou is the Senegal international&#8217;s favoured option.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Juventus are in a strong position to sign Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba, with Paris Saint-Germain pulling out of a potential deal and Manchester City being a no-go, according to Calciomercato. With Pogba&#8217;s contract running out at the end of this month, Juventus are set to offer a contract of at least three years on \u20ac8m-per-season plus bonuses. It would put the Frenchman alongside Matthijs de Ligt as their biggest earner.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Lazio want to sign Chelsea midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek if either Sergej Milinkovic-Savic or Luis Alberto depart, as reported by Gazzetta dello Sport. The Serie A outfit would offer the Englishman \u20ac4m-per-year, while Chelsea are expected to want a transfer fee of at least \u20ac20m. Despite this making any move difficult for Lazio, they will prioritise him if either of their midfielders leaves.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; It seems increasingly likely that Nayef Aguerd will join West Ham United, and Foot Mercato has suggested that Stade Rennais see Lyon centre-back Jason Denayer as his replacement. Belgium international Denayer is edging closer to the exit door at Lyon with his contract ending on June 30, and while there is expected to be competition from English clubs who would be able to offer more lucrative financial packages, Rennes are hoping they will be able to persuade Denayer to stay in France.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The summer transfer window is approaching, and there&#8217;s plenty of gossip swirling about who&#8217;s moving where.
