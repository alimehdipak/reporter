The best thing about electric toothbrushes is that they help to clean your teeth better than manual ones. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Electric toothbrushes have a motor that helps to move the brush around your mouth. You can also find different kinds of toothbrush heads that you can use. Some of them are for cleaning your teeth, others for whitening, and some are even for your tongue.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Be diligent about flossing<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flossing is also important for preventing gum disease and cavities.
