If properly baled and stored, hay can last a long time without degrading in quality. Twine is the least expensive bailing material, but some hay can be lost as it is baled and moved. Twine bales are also more prone to damage when stored outside.<\/p>\n<p>How do you bale your own hay?<\/p>\n<p>How To Bale Hay Using Hand Hay Baler Tutorial:<br \/>Step 1: Build Your Baler. | Step 2: Stand Baler Firmly On A Level Ground. | Step 3: Cut Polypropylene Twine And Tie Loops.

Step 8: Tie Off Loops.<\/p>\n<p>What is the difference between bail and Bale?<\/p>\n<p>Here are the most common uses of the words: Bale is a large bound stack of material, such as hay or leather; Bail is the security deposit that\u2019s paid if someone who\u2019s been temporarily released from jail pending a trial doesn\u2019t appear in court.<\/p>\n<h3>How big is a bail of hay?<\/h3>\n<p>Two-string hay bales are typically 14\u201d high x 18\u201d wide x 35\u201d long, and three-string bales are 16\u201d high x 22\u201d wide x 44\u201d long. Round bales can come in various diameters depending on what size baler was used to make them. Standard sizes are 5 feet wide and 6 feet in diameter or 4 feet wide and 5 feet in diameter.<\/p>\n<p>Why do farmers leave hay bales in the field?<\/p>\n<p>You might find hay bales left in a field simply because a farmer hasn\u2019t had time to stop by and grab the bales yet. Most farmers work overtime during the summer to get the hay in the barn by the time the fields stop producing.<\/p>\n<p>Is bale of hay correct?<\/p>\n<p>A bale is a compact, easy-to-move bundle of a crop like hay or cotton. Bales are formed in various shapes by a machine called a baler, and wrapped in twine or wire so they can be efficiently transported or stored. The word bale is Old French for \u201crolled-up bundle,\u201d from the same Germanic root as ball.<\/p>\n<p>Is straw the same as hay?<\/p>\n<p>Hay is a crop that is grown and harvested as a feed crop for cattle, horses and other farm animals. Straw on the other hand is a byproduct of a grain crop; in our area it\u2019s usually usually wheat straw that we see.<\/p>\n<h3>What do Tedders do?<\/h3>\n<p>A tedder (also called hay tedder) is a machine used in haymaking. It is used after cutting and before windrowing, and uses moving forks to aerate or \u201cwuffle\u201d the hay and thus speed up the process of hay-making. The use of a tedder allows the hay to dry (\u201ccure\u201d) better, which results in improved aroma and color.<\/p>\n<p>Why is hay wrapped in white plastic?<\/p>\n<p>The last few decades have brought increased interest in the use of plastic wrapped bales for forage. The advantages are clear: reduction in drying time, better leaf retention compared to dry hay, no storage structures needed, and reduction in weather risk.<\/p>\n<p>How do you rake a hay field?<\/p>\n<p>How to Round Rake a Hay Field<br \/>Set the width depending on hay volume and toughness. Rake two or three windrows together. Let the rake down in time to pick up the very end of the row. Pick up all of the wind rows. When you arrive at the end of your row, raise the rake as you turn around.<\/p>\n<p>Can you bail hay by hand?<\/p>\n<p>Baling hay compresses it so it requires less space, and bales can be stacked more efficiently too. What is this? Making hay bales, whether by hand or by machine, is simply a matter of saving space.<\/p>\n<p>Do you bail water?<\/p>\n<p>As a verb, bail means to remove water by using a bucket.<\/p>\n<h3>What\u2019s the difference between bail and bond?<\/h3>\n<p>Bail is the money a defendant must pay in order to get out of jail. A bond is posted on a defendant\u2019s behalf, usually by a bail bond company, to secure his or her release. Defendants with pending warrants are usually not eligible for bail.<\/p>\n<p>How heavy is a bale of hay?<\/p>\n<p>A two-string square hay bale can weigh anywhere between 40-75 lb (18-34 kg). Three-string square bales weigh around 100 lb (45 kg), and some bales weigh around 140 lb (63.5 kg). The average round hay bale weight is about 1,250 lb (567 kg), but the weights can vary greatly between 563-1,584 lb (255-718.5 kg).<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is baling of hay? noun. a large bundle or package prepared for shipping, storage, or sale, especially one tightly compressed and secured by wires, hoops, cords, or the like, and sometimes&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":486,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[6],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2884"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2884"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2884\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2884"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2884"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2884"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
