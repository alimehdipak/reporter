The Williamsburg resident decided it was time to lighten up. She started spicing up her wardrobe with cheery pastels. A favorite new look is a bold purple shirt dress that she\u2019ll pair with a pretty pink purse and rhinestone block heels for a girls\u2019 night out.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAfter COVID, I was sick of wearing boring clothes. I want to take a picture in any outfit that isn\u2019t all black,\u201d said Saldarriaga, who credits Gen Z fashion influencers with showing her that \u201cI don\u2019t have to wear black to look sleek and chic.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sleek onyx looks, long a staple of many a New Yorker\u2019s wardrobe, are now being pushed to the back of the closet as Gothamites embrace clothing in bright, bold colors \u2014 from garden-party florals dresses to chic monochromatic suiting.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/black3.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Lara Bogossian\" \/>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to look like a neon sign or a pi\u00f1ata by any means, but I said, \u2018I have enough dark colors. I need to brighten up my look,\u2019 \u201d Lara Bogossian, 30, told The Post.Courtesy of Lara Bogossian    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt has to do with the psychology of being locked down for two years and not wanting to dress in what the Southerners call mourning attire,\u201d\u00a0Shawn Grain Carter, associate professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology, told The Post. \u201cWearing color is more of an escape from what\u2019s going on. You\u2019ve got a war, economic instability, new waves of COVID madness \u2014 people want to feel good, and so you put on a pink dress or a beautiful yellow set. These are happy colors that make people feel mentally stable and emotionally comfortable.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Manhattanite Lara Bogossian typically wore all black \u2013 save for a swipe of red lipstick \u2013 but her wardrobe palette changed after spending some time in 2020 in Los Angeles, where she\u2019s originally from. When she returned to New York City, she had a new outlook and a number of new jewel-tone tops.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to look like a neon sign or a pi\u00f1ata by any means, but I said, \u2018I have enough dark colors. I need to brighten up my look,\u2019 \u201d Bogossian, 30, told The Post. \u201cI was elated to be back. I was optimistic.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Designers are taking note of fashionistas\u2019 hunger for new hues.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re noticing our Wild Pink, Sky Blue and Radiant Yellow styles from the summer collection are best-selling colors at the moment,\u201d designer Ramy Brook told The Post. \u201cNew Yorkers are going for brighter shades.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>For some, opting for more color is about growing up.\u00a0Brooklyn native Christina Izzo, 32 and a writer living on the Upper West Side, remembers adapting the all-ebony uniform in middle school, adorning herself in mesh tops and leather cuff accessories from Hot Topic. The self-proclaimed former goth kid leaned into a more Stevie Nicks aesthetic in her late teens and early 20s, wearing oversize charcoal caftans, heeled leather boots and black blazers.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/black-2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Christina Izzo\" \/>Christina Izzo said that turning 30 inspired her to embrace more shades.Courtesy of Christina Izzo    <\/p>\n<p>Her milestone 30th birthday inspired her to embrace more shades.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI felt like most of my life, I had been wanting to hide and was literally covering myself in shadow and darkness to do so,\u201d Izzo said. \u201cBut I think stepping more firmly into adulthood and into who I am, I started realizing how quickly it all goes by and how much I wanted to express parts of myself that I previously wasn\u2019t allowing myself to.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Her fresh new outfits include a periwinkle crop top and matching pants and a pastel pink pantsuit that she wore to her sister\u2019s bridal shower, puzzling even her closest family members.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA cousin came up to me saying, \u2018Is this \u2026 you?
