His death, at 52, was ruled a suicide by hanging.<\/p>\n<p>Five years after the \u201cBlack Hole Sun\u201d singer\u2019s death, fans are still trying to understand why Cornell suddenly fell into the darkest of places. Although he had battled mental health issues such as depression and anxiety, as well as substance-abuse problems, the man with one of rock\u2019s greatest voices \u2014 possessing a four-octave range \u2014 seemed to have escaped being another one of grunge\u2019s tragic losses.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/113920854.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Chris Cornell\" \/>Chris Cornell goes airborne during a Soundgarden show, circa early \u201990s.FilmMagic    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cHis death was a complete shock,\u201d Mark Yarm, author of \u201cEverybody Loves Our Town: An Oral History of Grunge,\u201d told The Post. \u201cOf those four main grunge bands, we\u2019ve lost [Nirvana\u2019s] Kurt Cobain, we\u2019ve lost [Alice in Chains\u2019] Layne Staley, and we\u2019ve lost Chris Cornell. Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam is the only one who survives.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou felt that Chris had made it through to the other side \u2014 he was happily married, he had a family and everything,\u201d said Chris Celona, who co-hosts the \u201cGrunge Bible\u201d podcast with Ethan Shalaway. \u201cBecause he had persisted and had success into his 40s and 50s, you got the sense that he was really embarking on the second or even third act of his career as kind of an elder statesman of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, in a 2015 interview, Cornell said he planned on rocking well into his golden years: \u201cI would look at older blues musicians who just keep going into their 70s. They keep doing it until they drop dead. And I\u2019ve always felt like that\u2019s what I want to do \u2026 I plan on doing this forever.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/51970735.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Soundgarden at the 1994 Grammys\" \/>Chris Cornell and Soundgarden won two Grammys in 1994.AFP via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>After having a bad experience smoking PCP when he was 14, Cornell suffered from severe depression and panic disorder as a teenager. But music helped to lift him out of his isolation, and he went on to become a founding member of Soundgarden in 1984.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cInitially, he was the drummer,\u201d said Yarm. \u201cHe was singing from behind the drums. But that didn\u2019t last very long because he had such natural frontman charisma.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But behind the roaring vocals there was a kind, gentle soul. \u201cI don\u2019t think any one person can say anything bad about Chris. I really don\u2019t,\u201d said photographer Chris Cuffaro, who shot Cornell and Soundgarden in the late \u201980s and early \u201990s. \u201cChris was just the nicest guy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/146146712.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Chris Cornell in 2012\" \/>Chris Cornell performing at the Download Festival in Donington Park, England, in 2012.WireImage    <\/p>\n<p>And even after the success of Soundgarden\u2019s 1991 breakthrough \u201cBadmotorfinger\u201d catapulted him from the Seattle grunge scene to rock stardom, Cornell remained a bit of a loner at heart. \u201cHe was pretty low-key,\u201d said Cuffaro. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t outgoing.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>After Soundgarden broke up in 1997, Cornell began using drugs such as OxyContin as well as drinking heavily \u2014\u00a0a vice he\u2019d struggled with in previous years. Finally, while fronting his new band Audioslave, he went to rehab in 2002.<\/p>\n<p>And by the time a reunited Soundgarden went on tour in 2017, Cornell\u2019s dark days seemed to be well behind him. \u201cAs far as the public knew, he was clean and sober,\u201d said Yarm.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/685990770.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Chris Cornell in 1996\" \/>Chris Cornell performing with Soundgarden at Lollapalooza in 1996.Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>But after the concert on that fateful night five years ago, Cornell called his wife Vicky, slurring\u00a0his words while repeating that \u201cI am just tired.\u201d He also admitted to taking \u201can extra Ativan or two\u201d for his anxiety before hanging up. Shortly thereafter, he was found dead.<\/p>\n<p>After his death, Cornell won a posthumous Grammy for Best Rock Performance\u00a0 (\u201cWhen Bad Does Good\u201d) in 2019, and the two youngest of his three children \u2014 Toni, now 17, and Christopher, now 16 \u2014 accepted the award in their father\u2019s honor. And last month, Toni performed her dad\u2019s cover of \u201cNothing Compares 2 U\u201d on \u201cThe Late Late Show With James Corden.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"906\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/Chris_Cornell_Wife_Letter.jpg?w=906\" alt=\"Chris Cornell and Vicky Cornell\" \/>Chris Cornell with wife Vicky Karayiannis in 2012.AP    <\/p>\n<p>Celona believes that if Cornell had lived, \u201cWe would have seen some collaborations between him and his kids, which would have been really special.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, though, Cornell couldn\u2019t outrun the demons he sang about on songs such as the Soundgarden hit \u201cFell on Black Days\u201d: \u201cWhatsoever I feared has come to light\/And whatsoever I\u2019ve fought off became my life.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>During the encore of the Soundgarden show at Detroit\u2019s Fox Theatre on May 17, 2017, Chris Cornell \u2014 in all of his grunge-god glory \u2014 seemed ready to rock on to the&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":3006,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[5],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3005"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/6"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3005"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3005\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3005"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3005"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3005"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
