During mitosis, the DNA is exactly copied and a new daughter cell created with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell, ie 46.<\/p>\n<h3>Where does mitosis usually occur?<\/h3>\n<p>Mitosis occurs in somatic cells; this means that it takes place in all types of cells that are not involved in the production of gametes. Prior to each mitotic division, a copy of every chromosome is created; thus, following division, a complete set of chromosomes is found in the nucleus of each new cell.<\/p>\n<p>What causes mitosis to occur?<\/p>\n<p>Mitosis is a process where a single cell divides into two identical daughter cells (cell division). During mitosis one cell? divides once to form two identical cells. The major purpose of mitosis is for growth and to replace worn out cells.<\/p>\n<p>In what phase does cell division occur?<\/p>\n<p>Mitosis (the M phase)<\/p>\n<p>The process of mitosis, or cell division, is also known as the M phase. This is where the cell divides its previously-copied DNA and cytoplasm to make two new, identical daughter cells.<\/p>\n<p>Where does meiosis occur?<\/p>\n<p>Meiosis occurs in the primordial germ cells, cells specified for sexual reproduction and separate from the body\u2019s normal somatic cells. In preparation for meiosis, a germ cell goes through interphase, during which the entire cell (including the genetic material contained in the nucleus) undergoes replication.<\/p>\n<h3>Where does cell mitosis occur quizlet?<\/h3>\n<p>Where does mitosis take place? Mitosis takes place in all cells of the body.<\/p>\n<p>What stage occurs before meiosis and mitosis?<\/p>\n<p>The S phase of a cell cycle occurs during interphase, before mitosis or meiosis, and is responsible for the synthesis or replication of DNA. In this way, the genetic material of a cell is doubled before it enters mitosis or meiosis, allowing there to be enough DNA to be split into daughter cells.<\/p>\n<p>What must occur before mitosis takes place?<\/p>\n<p>Before a cell can enter the active phases of mitosis, however, it must go through a period known as interphase, during which it grows and produces the various proteins necessary for division.<\/p>\n<p>Does mitosis occur in all of the body\u2019s cells?<\/p>\n<p>Most of the time when people refer to \u201ccell division,\u201d they mean mitosis, the process of making new body cells and it occurs in all somatic cells.<\/p>\n<h3>During what phase of the cell cycle does the cell prepare for mitosis?<\/h3>\n<p>Interphase is the phase of the cell cycle in which a typical cell spends most of its life. Interphase is the \u2018daily living\u2019 or metabolic phase of the cell, in which the cell obtains nutrients and metabolizes them, grows, replicates its DNA in preparation for mitosis, and conducts other \u201cnormal\u201d cell functions.<\/p>\n<p>What is the first phase of mitosis?<\/p>\n<p>Prophase is the first stage in mitosis, occurring after the conclusion of the G2 portion of interphase. During prophase, the parent cell chromosomes \u2014 which were duplicated during S phase \u2014 condense and become thousands of times more compact than they were during interphase.<\/p>\n<p>What happens in G1 phase?<\/p>\n<p>In G1, cells accomplish most of their growth; they get bigger in size and make proteins and organelles needed for normal functions of DNA synthesis. Here, proteins and RNAs are synthesized, and, more especially the centromere and the other components of the centrosomes are made.<\/p>\n<p>Where do meiosis and mitosis take place?<\/p>\n<p>Meiosis occurs at the time of male and female gamete formation during sexual reproduction. Mitosis occurs in the somatic cells for growth, repair and regeneration.<\/p>\n<p>Is meiosis before or after fertilization?<\/p>\n<p>1 Answer. Meiosis occurs before fertilization.<\/p>\n<h3>What are the 4 stages of the cell cycle?<\/h3>\n<p>In eukaryotes, the cell cycle consists of four discrete phases: G1, S, G2, and M. The S or synthesis phase is when DNA replication occurs, and the M or mitosis phase is when the cell actually divides. The other two phases \u2014 G1 and G2, the so-called gap phases \u2014 are less dramatic but equally important.<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Explanation: Cell division by mitosis occurs in all human body cells except the gonads (sex cells).
