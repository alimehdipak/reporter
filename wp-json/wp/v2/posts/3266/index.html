The new ones we\u2019ve been seeing lately. The ones with beards and c \u2013 \u2013 ks. They\u2019re as good as gold, I love them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Then, referencing the highly-publicized trans bathroom controversy, the \u201cAfterlife\u201d star said, \u201cAnd now the old-fashioned ones say, \u2018Oh, they want to use our toilets.\u2019 \u2018Why shouldn\u2019t they use your toilets?\u2019 \u2018For ladies!\u2019 <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/Ricky-Gervais-63.jpg?w=1024\" \/>Ricky Gervais is being ripped by LGBTQ advocates online over perceived transphobic jokes in his new special \u201cSuperNature.\u201dNetflix    <\/p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018They\u00a0<em>are<\/em>\u00a0ladies \u2014 look at their pronouns!

He was criticizing how the trend of comics getting canceled today for old tweets that weren\u2019t considered controversial at the time.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t predict what will be offensive in the future,\u201d said Gervais, who has quipped in the past that his ultimate goal is to get canceled. \u201cLike, the worst thing you can say today, get you canceled on Twitter, death threats, the worst thing you can say today is, \u2018Women don\u2019t have penises,\u2019 right? Now, no one saw that coming.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou won\u2019t find a ten-year-old tweet saying \u2018Women don\u2019t have penises.\u2019 You know why? We didn\u2019t think we f \u2013 \u2013 king had to!\u201d the comic added. He had previously stated that\u00a0\u201csmart people\u201d don\u2019t get offended by jokes about AIDS, Hitler and other taboo topics.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>Despite the perceived transphobic jokes, Ricky Gervais maintained in the special that he actually a big supporter of the trans community. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cFull disclosure: In real life of course I support trans rights. I support all human rights, and trans rights are human rights,\u201d the comic insisted. \u201cLive your best life. Use your preferred pronouns. Be the gender that you feel you are. But meet me halfway, ladies. Lose the c \u2013 \u2013 k. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Needless to say, the inflammatory jokes didn\u2019t sit well with many online, who accused the Brit of punching down at a marginalized community. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cRicky Gervais has a new stand-up show out on Netflix today,\u201d fumed one critic on Twitter. \u201c5 minutes in and he\u2019s making jokes about trans women attacking and raping people in public bathrooms. To him, we exist only as a punchline, a threat, something less than human.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Another tweeted, \u201cIf you\u2019re a comedian and you support trans people it\u2019s your responsibility to be speaking out against Dave Chappelle and the new Ricky Gervais special. At this point, you can\u2019t call yourself an ally if you\u2019re not publicly taking a stand against it. it\u2019s the bare minimum.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Another found it hypocritical of Gervais, who\u2019s a staunch animal activist, slamming trans people while railing against animal abuse. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s insane that Ricky Gervais\u2019 whole bit is screeching and cackling at marginalized groups being brutally murdered daily, before turning to the camera, making a sad face, and saying \u2018some people put lipstick on bunnies,&#8217;\u201d they wrote. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn honor of Ricky Gervais and his 2-4-1 rant on trans people and cancel culture, I am in fact, canceling,\u201d fumed one critic about the streaming service, which recently lost a boatload of subscribers. \u201cThanks @netflix #TransRightsAreHumanRights.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Advocacy group GLAAD also weighed in on Tuesday afternoon, tweeting in a thread that the special was \u201cfull of graphic, dangerous, anti-trans rants masquerading as jokes.
