Patients who received psychosocial and behavioral therapy had higher rates of co-occurring mental health and substance use diagnoses, including cannabis and stimulant use disorders.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Patients who have comorbid substance use disorders that lack effective medication options, such as cocaine and amphetamines, could represent a priority group for psychosocial services,&#8221; adds Samples. &#8220;Further research to understand the relationship between clinical profiles and therapy services is critical to align patient needs with evidence-based treatment to improve medication retention and patient outcomes.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The study was the first to characterize trends in psychosocial and behavioral therapy received alongside buprenorphine in the treatment of adults with opioid use disorder.<\/p>\n<p>Story Source:<\/p>\n<p>Materials provided by Rutgers University.
