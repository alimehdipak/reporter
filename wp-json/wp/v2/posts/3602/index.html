I will do what they want. We will see soon! Don&#8217;t be in a hurry because we will see this together.

Arsenal hope the Brazil international will be looking to move on for regular first-team football ahead of the World Cup in November.<\/p>\n<p>The report says that a weekly wage of \u00a3190,000 could tempt Jesus away from the Premier League champions. His City deal earns him \u00a3110,000 a week.<\/p>\n<p>Even though Jesus only has one year left on his City contract, they will still look for a transfer fee in the region of \u00a350m.<\/p>\n<p>10.58 BST: The Sunday Mirror reports that Barcelona have told Mohamed Salah they are ready to sign the forward on a free transfer when his Liverpool contract expires next summer.<\/p>\n<p>Salah, who celebrates his 30th birthday later this month, has committed his future to the Reds for the coming season but has so far rejected the chance to sign an extension to his deal.<\/p>\n<p>10.14 BST: Paul Pogba is still mulling over offers from Juventus, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain after the France midfielder&#8217;s exit from Manchester United was officially announced, according to Sky Sports.<\/p>\n<p>Pogba is using his post-season break to think about his future, with all three interested clubs making attractive offers to the World Cup winner. Perhaps with this in mind, Pogba&#8217;s final decision regarding his next destination will be football motivated. Now 29, Pogba is aware that this could be the last big move of his career and wants to take his time to ensure the right decision is made.<\/p>\n<p>It has previously been reported that Juventus are very confident of taking Pogba back to Serie A, but Real Madrid and PSG appear to still be in with a chance.<\/p>\n<p>09.30 BST: The Daily Mail reports that Tottenham Hotspur have turned down a transfer offer of \u00a317m from Ajax for Steven Bergwijn.<\/p>\n<p>Bergwijn, 24, is desperate for more regular first team football and would be interested in a move to Amsterdam, his place of birth.<\/p>\n<p>However, sources told ESPN on Friday that Spurs are continuing to demand up to \u20ac25m for Bergwijn.<\/p>\n<h2>PAPER GOSSIP <\/h2>\n<p>&#8211; AC Milan have made first contact with Club Brugge regarding a possible move for Charles De Ketelaere, according to Calciomercato. The Belgian club&#8217;s current demand of a \u20ac30m transfer fee is deemed to be too high but there is room for negotiation, with Milan intending to do everything possible to ensure he is part of Stefano Pioli&#8217;s squad next season.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; A move to AC Milan remains the priority for Lille centre-back Sven Botman this summer, but Calciomercato reports that a change of ownership at San Siro has delayed a deal. If they decide to invest the \u20ac30m needed for the move elsewhere, then it is likely the Dutchman will be headed to Newcastle United.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Henrikh Mkhitaryan could join Inter Milan when his AS Roma contract expires at the end of June, and La Gazzetta dello Sport have offered the names of three players they are considering bringing in to replace the Armenian. Isco, who will be a free agent when his Real Madrid contract ends this summer, and Mario Gotze of PSV Eindhoven could be options, with the former seen as the more likely of the two. Facundo Farias of Colon, who would require a \u20ac10m transfer fee, is also on Jose Mourinho&#8217;s shortlist amid rival interest from Atalanta, Fiorentina, Juventus and Atletico Madrid.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Dani Ceballos, Marco Asensio, Luka Jovic, Mariano Diaz, Jesus Vallejo, and Andriy Lunin all have an uncertain future at Real Madrid, according to Marca. This news comes with Gareth Bale and Marcelo already having said their goodbyes at the Bernabeu.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; As reported by Fabrizio Romano, Newcastle United have reached an agreement with Stade de Reims for a deal to sign Hugo Ekitike, worth \u20ac30m plus \u20ac5m in add-ons. The Magpies will now hold negotiations with the 19-year-old striker&#8217;s agent.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The summer transfer window is approaching, and there&#8217;s plenty of gossip swirling about who&#8217;s moving where.
