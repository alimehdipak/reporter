The device works through compressors contained in each ear cup, which work to \u201cproject two streams of purified air to the wearer\u2019s nose and mouth\u201d through the visor<\/p>\n<p>The \u201cZone\u201d is capable of filtering up to 99% of particle pollution, Dyson officials told The Verge. The visor can also be removed if the wearer prefers to just use the headphones. The device is meant to protect against air pollution, not to serve as a replacement for masks that protect against COVID-19, according to Mashable.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>Get in the zone with Dyson\u2019s latest technology. <\/p>\n<p>30 years of air filtration expertise pioneered into a wearable, high-end audio device.
