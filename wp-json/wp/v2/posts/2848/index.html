You&#8217;d think a four-goal extravaganza for a club struggling to score would soothe the wounds of Five Stripes faithful who&#8217;d been ticking days off the calendar until Josef Martinez&#8217;s return. In April, Atlanta only scored three MLS goals. But the story of Atlanta&#8217;s (and USMNT) fans&#8217; weekend was Miles Robinson&#8217;s Achilles tear, the third in a month for the club, including goalkeepers Brad Guzan and Dylan Castanheira. Despite all the misfortune, Atlanta still lead MLS in passing percentage and are third in chances created &#8211; largely due to Brooks Lennon&#8217;s 4th-best total (29) &#8211; a feat considering how shorthanded they&#8217;ve been. <i>&#8212; Hajducky<\/i><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/soccer\/500-dark\/6077.png&amp;w=126&amp;site=espnfc\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Previous ranking: 13<\/p>\n<p>Next MLS match: Saturday vs. Nashville SC, 8:30 p.m. ET, ESPN+<\/p>\n<p>Water seems to be finding its own level in Houston.

Columbus showed grit against New England on Saturday, erasing a 2-1 deficit in the 89th minute. After going scoreless in league play for a month, the Crew have scored five in their past two &#8212; and only Cincy&#8217;s Luciano Acosta and reining MLS MVP Carles Gil have created more chances than Lucas Zelarayan.

Not that it was Turner&#8217;s fault: Uncharacteristic man-marking lapses on crosses led to both goals the Revs conceded. After only allowing 41 goals all 2021, New England has already conceded 18. It looks a revitalized side with the Arsenal-bound Turner back in net, but it&#8217;s lost half its matches despite only conceding first in three games.

A gifted PK on April 30 marked Chicago&#8217;s first goal since March 19, which was the last time the Fire took maximum points. Over the weekend, they were drubbed by Atlanta down in Fulton County and now sit in last in the East. They&#8217;ve been staunch goal defenders, allowing only 11 through 10 games, but the retooled offense has been paltry. Former Liverpool man Xherdan Shaqiri and Kacper Przybylko &#8212; who tallied the third-most MLS goals from April 2019 to the start of the 2022 season &#8212; have combined for just 10 shots on goal. <i>&#8212; Hajducky<\/i><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/i\/teamlogos\/soccer\/500\/18267.png\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Previous ranking: 24<\/p>\n<p>Next MLS match: Saturday at Chicago Fire, 8 p.m. ET, ESPN+<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t look now, but Cincy is &#8230; in form? Yes, it beat Toronto twice, but its last loss was a 2-1 decision to stalwart LAFC on April 24 that easily could&#8217;ve gone the other way. It also boasts MLS&#8217; leading chance-creator in Luciano Acosta and has new defensive life: Cincinnati, who has the two worst goals-conceding seasons of all time, hasn&#8217;t allowed more than one goal in a game in all competitions since April 2.

With a tough upcoming schedule, including three games in eight days (including the Red Bulls in the U.S. Open Cup on Tuesday), that&#8217;s unlikely to change. <i>&#8212; Hajducky<\/i><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/soccer\/500-dark\/9727.png&amp;w=126&amp;site=espnfc\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Previous ranking: 27<\/p>\n<p>Next MLS match: Saturday vs. San Jose Earthquakes, 7 p.m. ET, ESPN+<\/p>\n<p>Did Vancouver&#8217;s 1-0 win over Toronto have a huge slice of luck about it? You bet, as a disallowed goal from TFC&#8217;s Jayden Nelson should have stood. The Whitecaps won&#8217;t care, nor should they. They got a badly needed win &#8212; it snapped a three-game losing streak &#8212; thanks to Tosaint Ricketts&#8217; late goal, his first in MLS since 2020. <i>&#8212; Carlisle<\/i><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/soccer\/500-dark\/191.png&amp;w=126&amp;site=espnfc\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Previous ranking: 28<\/p>\n<p>Next MLS match: Saturday at Vancouver Whitecaps, 7 p.m. ET, ESPN+<\/p>\n<p>Among the odd aspects of the Matias Almeyda era was his team&#8217;s inability to get more out of home matches. That looks to be changing under Alex Covelo, as the Quakes defeated Colorado 1-0 for their second straight home win. The return of Nathan has provided a big boost as well. <i>&#8212; Carlisle<\/i><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/soccer\/500-dark\/186.png&amp;w=126&amp;site=espnfc\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Previous ranking: 26<\/p>\n<p>Next MLS match: Saturday at Portland Timbers, 10 p.m. ET, ESPN+<\/p>\n<p>A 0-0 draw with NYCFC extended Kansas City&#8217;s winless streak to six games, but a road point against the defending champs counts as a positive. A revised team shape in which Peter Vermes utilized a 4-3-1-2 gave SKC more defensive strength as well. <i>&#8212; Carlisle<\/i><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>May 9, 2022Jeff CarlisleCloseU.S. soccer correspondentJeff Carlisle covers MLS and the U.S. national team for ESPN FC.Dan HajduckyCloseESPNHajducky is a reporter\/researcher for ESPN.
