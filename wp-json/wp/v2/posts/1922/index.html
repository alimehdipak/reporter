I\u2019m from Asia, and we have a strong culture of hospitality there.<\/p>\n<h2>You lived in New York. What was your favorite neighborhood?<\/h2>\n<p>I lived in both Tribeca and the Upper East Side, and I have to say that I loved the neighborhood and residential feel of being uptown the most.<\/p>\n<h2>Do you have a favorite hotel in the city?<\/h2>\n<p>The Plaza is obviously a special place for me given my time there. Then there\u2019s Baccarat, the Mark, the Greenwich and Four Seasons Downtown. I like to experience different hotels.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/Priyanka-Chopra-12.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Accor owns thousands of top hotels around the workd.\" \/>Accor operates thousands of top hotels around the world.ALL \u2013 Accor Live Limitless    <\/p>\n<h2>You are a partner at the Indian eatery Sona in the Flatiron District, but what are some of your other favorite restaurants?<\/h2>\n<p>I love Cipriani for the great pastas and cocktails, and Temple Bar and the ABC restaurants. I\u2019m an explorer, though, and love trying different places.<\/p>\n<h2>Describe your perfect Sunday in the city.<\/h2>\n<p>If I\u2019m not working, which I usually am, I wake up late \u2014 like 10 or 11 a.m. \u2014 and then wander around. I end up someplace for brunch, often Sona because I love dosas, and the restaurant does great ones. I go to the park with my dogs, get lost in the Strand and check out boutiques in Soho. I take in the diversity of the city.<\/p>\n<h2>What about your ideal Saturday night out?<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s about our group of friends hanging out and ordering awesome food. Or going out for a great meal. Maybe Polo Bar. I love the vibe there. Or maybe it\u2019s seeing a Broadway show and discussing it afterwards over dinner.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"729\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/Priyanka-Chopra-13.jpg?w=729\" alt=\"Chopra Jonas says that she loves to explore the dining scenes in the cities she visits.\" \/>Chopra Jonas says that she loves to explore the dining scenes in the cities she visits. ALL \u2013 Accor Live Limitless    <\/p>\n<h2>What are your other favorite city\u2019s to explore?<\/h2>\n<p>Goa, Rome and Los Angeles where I live are my favorites. I find peace in the community in LA and hiking with my dogs.<\/p>\n<h2>What destinations are on top of your must-visit list?<\/h2>\n<p>I really want to start traveling for leisure again. I want to go to Venice and back to Turks and Caicos to feel the sand in my feet \u2014 then the South of France, Hawaii and back to Asia. I love Thailand and India, which is home. I haven\u2019t been back in two years.<\/p>\n<h2>Tell us what kind of traveler you are: Go, go, go? Chilled out? <\/h2>\n<p>If I\u2019m going for work, I\u2019m focused on the job and won\u2019t see the city I\u2019m in. For vacations, I make no plans or schedule because my life is a schedule with a call sheet and set times. Vacations need to be the opposite. I don\u2019t pre-book tours and don\u2019t want to be told when to go to dinner. I\u2019ll see where the day takes me.<\/p>\n<h2>Do you use a travel advisor to book your trips, or do you like to be in the driver\u2019s seat yourself?<\/h2>\n<p>My husband is my travel advisor! He\u2019s really good at planning trips and he\u2019s an experience guy.
