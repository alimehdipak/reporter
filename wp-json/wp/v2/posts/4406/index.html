I came from Mulberry Street, how do you live on Mulberry Street and not know mob guys?\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>He said that Caan \u201cfell in love with mobsters\u201d through his experience on the 1972 set. \u201c\u2019Til the day he died, he thought he was a mobster. He thought he was Sonny Corleone,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Russo also claims that Caan went too far in an infamous \u201cGodfather\u201d fight scene where Sonny pummels Carlo for hitting his sister.<\/p>\n<p>Although Russo said that a stunt double was used, particularly when Carlo was thrown over a railing, he also was in the scene and was injured by Caan.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s me. He\u2019s biting my hand; he\u2019s banging my elbow with that steel garbage pail. He chipped my elbow,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I crawled out and he lifted me in the air, he broke\u00a0two of my ribs, which was not in the rehearsal.
