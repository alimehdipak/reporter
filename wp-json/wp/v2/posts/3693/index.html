How did you first get exposed to Judy?<\/p>\n<p>Well, \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d was a kind of yearly TV event that would occur around Easter usually. So the whole family would watch it. It started then, and then I sort of followed her entertainment yellow brick road. When I got to Hollywood and I saw her history \u2014 and also sort of the lore of the gay world \u2014 those things just kind of haunted me for many, many years.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/rufus-wainwright-507.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Lorna Luft and Rufus Wainwright at Stonewall Inn\" \/>Rufus Wainwright and Judy Garland\u2019s daughter, Lorna Luft, honored the Hollywood legend on Tuesday by unveiling a portrait that will hang at Stonewall Inn.John Nacion\/startraksphoto.com    <\/p>\n<p>Why do you think she has been the ultimate gay icon, that she has been so special to the gay community?<\/p>\n<p>I think that she experienced a lot of the same traumas that a lot of gay men experience, whether it\u2019s through battles with addiction or feeling really taken advantage of by society \u2014 or not respected, shall we say. Sometimes gay men, especially from that generation, were not allowed to express themselves, so there\u2019s that kind of trapped feeling \u2026 And I think that a lot of gay men feel like there\u2019s this inner Judy who wants to be known for who they are.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s also this connection between Judy and Stonewall, because she died right before the Stonewall Riots in 1969.<\/p>\n<p>I was honored to be able to sing \u201cOver the Rainbow\u201d on Tuesday at Stonewall, where they unveiled this\u00a0beautiful portrait of her that will be a permanent fixture of that space. It meant a lot to me as someone who\u2019s been gay their whole life and also really known about Judy Garland their whole life.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1021\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/rufus-wainwright-536.jpg?w=1024\" \/>The cover of Rufus Wainwright\u2019s new Judy Garland tribute album, \u201cRufus Does Judy at Capitol Studios.\u201dBig Hassle    <\/p>\n<p>There was \u201cOver the Rainbow,\u201d and then the rainbow became the symbol of the gay movement.<\/p>\n<p>Yeah, I think it memorializes it. It very much kind of adds to the strength that, sadly, the gay community needs.<\/p>\n<p>A gay man used to be called \u201ca friend of Dorothy,\u201d of course referencing her \u201cWizard of Oz\u201d character. But it\u2019s pretty incredible that she has remained in the fabric of the gay community for all these years, for generations really.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s nice about it is that at the end of the day \u2014 in spite of all of the symbolism and dramatic stories and so forth attached to her \u2014 in the end, it\u2019s all connected to the fact that she was an incredible singer and a great musician. And anyone \u2014 be it gay, straight, bisexual or transgender \u2014 can listen to those records and be moved by them. And that\u2019s the most important thing.<\/p>\n<p>In your City Winery show on Tuesday night, you talked about the fact that when you did \u201cRufus Does Judy Garland at Carnegie Hall,\u201d you really connected with Judy in a different way because of things that you were going through.<\/p>\n<p>When I first did the concert many years ago, in a lot of ways it was to exorcise Judy from me. I was a little bit overly obsessed with her. And certainly in my trials and tribulations with drugs and alcohol, I was fighting this kind of Judy-esque demon in a way. It was a way of maybe letting Judy go for a little while and maybe even setting her free \u2026 But years later now, I\u2019m a little older, and I\u2019ve been around for a while, and I\u2019ve certainly survived Hollywood. Now she\u2019s back, and it\u2019s more about her positive aspects and more about her strengths and her kind of resilience that I\u2019m more attracted to at the moment.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/rufus-wainwright-498.jpg?w=682\" \/>Rufus Wainwright first discovered Judy Garland through \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201dGetty Images    <\/p>\n<p>When you recorded this new album, you even used the microphone that she once used, right?<\/p>\n<p>Yeah, I did. I used her mic, and I recorded at Capitol Studios [in Hollywood] where she made a lot of records. It\u2019s more of a kind of jazz record, which I never really expected to make. It\u2019s with these really wonderful players who are really good at getting into the minutiae of the music, and so we were able to do that in that incredible room.<\/p>\n<p>As we remember Judy and honor her on her 100th birthday, is there anything about her that you think is underappreciated?<\/p>\n<p>Well, she was one of the great actresses too. Her sense of timing was impeccable in terms of acting. And it\u2019s a pity that she never did anything on stage, in the sense that she was never in a Broadway show. I think that would have been an amazing turn of events.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/rufus-wainwright-550.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Rufus Wainwright\" \/>Rufus Wainwright will hold the last night of his \u201cRufus Does Judy at City Winery\u201d residency on Judy Garland\u2019s 100th birthday.V. Tony Hauser    <\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s the Judy Garland song that speaks to you in the most personal way?<\/p>\n<p>Well, I mean, at the end of the day one has to go with \u201cOver the Rainbow.\u201d I would say it\u2019s probably the best song ever written. It\u2019s the kind of song that, when you sing it, you have to become invested emotionally in it. You can\u2019t just toss it off. You gotta go there.<\/p>\n<p>If you had gotten to meet Judy, what would you have liked to say to her?<\/p>\n<p>Oh, I don\u2019t know \u2026 Wanna go to an AA meeting with me?
