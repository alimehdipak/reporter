The requisite drama around Phil Mickelson? Check. A few tossed clubs? You bet. Kids running off with defending champion Jon Rahm&#8217;s ball on the 18th hole? OK. Wild turkeys on the course? Sure.<\/p>\n<p>Friday&#8217;s second round had just as much drama, with Mickelson missing the cut after struggling mightily. Collin Morikawa and Joel Dahmen share the lead at 5-under, but Rory McIlroy and defending champion Rahm are right behind them at 4-under. McIlroy is looking for his second tournament win in a row after winning the RBC Canadian Open last week. Round one leader Adam Hadwin fell to 2-under, but he&#8217;s still very much in contention.<\/p>\n<p>Check out all the sights and sounds from Day 2.<\/p>\n<h2>Morikawa in the lead<\/h2>\n<p>With a 4-under 66 and 36-hole total of 5 under, Collin Morikawa has put himself in position to grab yet another major championship. He&#8217;s already won the 2020 PGA Championship at Harding Park and the 2021 Open Championship at Royal St. George&#8217;s. With another victory at The Country Club, Morikawa would become the fifth golfer to win three different majors before turning 26. The other four to pull off that feat: Rory McIlroy, Jack Nicklaus, Jordan Spieth and Tiger Woods, who won all four. Morikawa would also become the first player to win a major in three straight seasons since Brooks Koepka from 2017 to 2019. <i>&#8212; Mark Schlabach<\/i><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>Morikawa brought the magic at The Country Club during Round 2  pic.twitter.com\/xR3MLGY1MY<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 U.S. Open (USGA) (@usopengolf) June 17, 2022<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>What&#8217;s the best thing you can do if you&#8217;re trying to make the cut at the U.S. Open?

He borrowed Tyrrell Hatton&#8217;s clubs until his bag got there. After Tarren missed the cut at the RBC Canadian Open last week, his clubs didn&#8217;t make it to Boston. He played a practice round with only a wedge. Tarren, who played at Radford University in Virginia, has just one top-10 finish on tour and has missed 10 cuts in 17 starts. <em>&#8212; Mark Schlabach<\/em><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>The defending champ is dialed in.@JonRahmPGA is within two @USOpenGolf. pic.twitter.com\/YJmOFmMZlv<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) June 17, 2022<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>267 yards away.

So while most people surrounding the first tee were waiting for McIlroy, who was in the following group, Stallings was going to get some love when he name was announced.

Two years ago, he made $5,750 on the All Pro Tour. He is also a volunteer assistant coach at Houston. But after making the turn at 6 under on Friday, MJ Daffue (pronounced &#8220;Duffey&#8221;) held a brief lead over the likes of Rory McIlroy, Matt Fitzpatrick and three others. Daffue, 33, was born in South Africa and played at Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas. He has already earned his PGA Tour card for 2022-23 through his good play on the Korn Ferry Tour, where he is fourth in The 25.

Somehow, he yanked his tee shot onto a raised walkway near the hospitality area on the left. He had tents, spectators and an oak tree to his left and a temporary fence to his right. After his caddie, Cougars golf coach Jonathan Dismuke, handed him a hybrid, Daffue hit his ball off artificial turf-like carpet. Remarkably, his ball landed in the deep rough above the green. He didn&#8217;t get his third shot out, however, then chipped past the pin about 7 feet. He two-putted from there for a bogey, which dropped him to 4 under. <em>&#8212; Schlabach<\/em><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming right over you, sir.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>Solo leader @mjdaffue13 hits one off the deck&#8230;literally. #USOpen pic.twitter.com\/5bo0YIIgpe<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 U.S. Open (USGA) (@usopengolf) June 17, 2022<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>Big early shots<\/h2>\n<p>Brooks Koepka, Cameron Smith, Scottie Scheffler, Justin Thomas, Dustin Johnson and Mickelson are among the big names on the course early Friday.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>.@SamBurns66 ALMOST had our first ace of @USOpenGolf  pic.twitter.com\/kQamZLtLCX<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) June 17, 2022<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>Making it look easy from DEEP  @BKoepka is off to a fast start @USOpenGolf. pic.twitter.com\/6VDPNYaEpY<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) June 17, 2022<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>Long birdie putts are all the rage this morning at The Country Club!@JustinThomas34 (+1) decided to get in on the act. #USOpen pic.twitter.com\/13qNA4itrf<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 U.S. Open (USGA) (@usopengolf) June 17, 2022<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>One hole.
