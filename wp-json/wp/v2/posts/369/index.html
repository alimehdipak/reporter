After this weekend comes one final international break, and then it&#8217;s time to decide some titles. While plenty of key races have been over for a while &#8212; it feels like Paris Saint-Germain all but clinched the Ligue 1 title in September, while Real Madrid&#8217;s LaLiga lead also looks pretty safe &#8212; many others will come down to the wire. Throw in some gripping relegation battles and the fact that lots of Champions League spots remain up for grabs, and we&#8217;ve got plenty to pay attention to in the final weeks of the season.<\/p>\n<p>Here, then are 10 particularly intriguing battles to devour in the coming weeks. <em>(Note: Odds below refer to FiveThirtyEight&#8217;s SPI ratings, found in their entirety here.)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><b>Jump to: PL title | Serie A title | WSL title | Bundesliga title | PL relegation | Belgian title | English Championship title | Ligue 1 race | 2.

Premier League title race<\/h2>\n<p>Liverpool have pulled off a magic act in recent months. They trailed Man City by 14 points on the evening of Jan. 15. City have only lost once in the last two months&#8230; and Liverpool are now within one point following Wednesday&#8217;s win over Arsenal. They&#8217;ve won nine straight league matches, and while City&#8217;s form hasn&#8217;t dipped much, they did still drop points against Southampton, Spurs and Crystal Palace.<\/p>\n<p>For as well as Liverpool have played this season, it still appeared the race was over in mid-January as City&#8217;s title odds, per SPI, rose as high as 88%. Instead, we&#8217;ve got ourselves an incredible home stretch ahead and after winning the League Cup in February, Liverpool are still very much alive in the hunt for not only the Premier League, but also the FA Cup and Champions League. An unheard-of quadruple remains in play.<\/p>\n<p>From an overall dominance perspective, this isn&#8217;t quite the same as the 2018-19 race, in which Man City won the league with a near-record 98 points and Liverpool finished second with 97. The champion should end up with around 91-92 points this time around, but it&#8217;s still staggering how much these two teams have separated themselves from the rest in a league so flush with both cash and talent. They rank first (City) and second (Liverpool) in the overall SPI ratings, with Liverpool creeping ahead of a previously indomitable Bayern Munich.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/soccer\/english-premier-league\/story\/4618228\/\" \/>Klopp&#8217;s Liverpool and Guardiola&#8217;s Man City seem set to go down to the wire with the title race.\u00a0Andrew Powell\/Liverpool FC via Getty Images<\/p>\n<p>As we approach the Champions League quarterfinals, SPI gives these two teams a combined 48% chance of winning the tournament, leaving 52% for the other six teams to divvy up.<\/p>\n<p>The pair have gotten to this level by primarily being more polished versions of themselves. With its counterpressing and intensity, Liverpool is starting 5.9 more possessions per match than opponents in the attacking third, and they&#8217;re on pace to score 10 more goals than they did during their 2019-20 title run. Pep Guardiola&#8217;s City, meanwhile, have a possession rate of 68% and an average of 8.3 passes per possession. They have indeed dropped some points here and there, but their statistical domination has barely waned even as Liverpool was reeling them in.<\/p>\n<p>Any more dropped points for either team could be awfully costly. Can they both avoid any home-stretch glitches as they did late in 2018-19?<\/p>\n<h2><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/leaguelogos\/soccer\/500\/12.png&amp;w=126&amp;site=espnfc\" width=\"50\" \/>2. Italian Serie A race<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><b>Relevant 538 odds:<\/b> Inter Milan 49%, AC Milan 33%, Napoli 15%, Juventus 3%<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><b>Key remaining matches:<\/b> Inter at Juventus (April 3), Napoli at fifth-place Atalanta (April 3), Atalanta at Milan (May 15)<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/soccer\/english-premier-league\/story\/4618228\/\" \/>play<\/p>\n<p>1:21<\/p>\n<p>Gab Marcotti reacts to Juventus&#8217; exit from the Champions League at the hands of Villarreal.<\/p>\n<p>When Inter beat Venezia on Jan. 22, SPI had seen just about enough. The defending <em>Scudetto<\/em> winners were unbeaten in 13 consecutive Serie A matches, dropping just six points along the way, and while their edge was only five points over rival Milan and seven over Napoli, SPI gave the <em>Nerazzurri<\/em> a 75% chance of winning a second straight league title.<\/p>\n<p>They&#8217;ve only won one of six league matches since: taking one point from back-to-back matches against Milan and Napoli, losing to 10th-place Sassuolo and taking home sloppy road draws against 19th-place Genoa and 11th-place Torino. Their outstanding performance against Liverpool in the Champions League &#8212; they won 1-0 at Anfield on March 8, which was impressive even if it wasn&#8217;t enough for them to advance &#8212; was a reminder of their high ceiling, and SPI still considers them the title favorites. But they&#8217;ve leaked a lot of points lately and they find themselves four points behind Milan, one back of Napoli and only three up on Juventus with a game in hand.<\/p>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p>Like Leverkusen, Inter have been rather unlucky: Their +0.9 xG differential per match over the past two months is better than either Milan or Napoli. But they have some catching up to do now, and they have to pull it off against a Milan team that has lost only once since mid-December and took seven points from matches against Juve, Inter and Napoli in recent weeks. Napoli, with the best defensive record in the league, aren&#8217;t exactly playing poorly either.<\/p>\n<p>Inter&#8217;s trip to Juve on April 3 is noteworthy for a couple of reasons. For one thing, it gives Juve a great chance to work its way further into the title race. Since losing three of five league matches in a tough fall stretch, the <em>Bianconeri<\/em> have gone 15 league matches unbeaten, and their last match before the international break is at home against last-place Salernitana.<\/p>\n<p>For another thing, it&#8217;s the only remaining match pitting top-four teams against each other. Serie A&#8217;s February schedule was loaded, but whoever thrives down the stretch will do so by winning matches they&#8217;re supposed to win, not by beating fellow contenders.<\/p>\n<h2>3.

Arsenal are two points up on Chelsea, but the Blues have a game in hand; meanwhile, Manchester City trails Manchester United by three points, but also have a game in hand and a solid advantage in the SPI ratings, which see both races coming down to the wire.<\/p>\n<p>Arsenal have rebounded nicely from a disappointing 2020-21 campaign. They finished a distant third behind Chelsea and Manchester City, and they had to hold off a rising Manchester United just to secure third place and a spot in the Champions League qualifiers. (They rose through qualification and have since advanced to next week&#8217;s quarterfinals against Wolfsburg.)<\/p>\n<p>They&#8217;ve shored up their defense a bit, allowing just 10 goals in 17 matches, but more importantly, they&#8217;ve fared well in big league matches, taking eight points from four matches against Chelsea and Manchester City. They do still have to face two top-six teams in their final five league matches (home vs. Tottenham on March 26, at West Ham on May 8), but England&#8217;s most decorated women&#8217;s club is well-positioned to win its first league title in three years.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to Sam Kerr&#8217;s late winner against Aston Villa, however, Chelsea still controls its own destiny.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6 at Kingsmeadow!@samkerr1 with the heroics! #BarclaysFAWSL @ChelseaFCW pic.twitter.com\/BS1em51LuZ<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Barclays FA Women&#8217;s Super League (@BarclaysFAWSL) March 13, 2022<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The Blues have six league matches remaining, and thanks to a heart-breaking group-stage exit in the Champions League &#8212; they tied for first in the toughest group, with Wolfsburg and Juventus, but lost the tie-breaker due to head-to-head goal differential &#8212; they don&#8217;t have to deal with continental play.<\/p>\n<p>Injuries and some COVID-19 issues have wreaked havoc with Emma Hayes&#8217; lineup choices of late, and sanctions on owner Roman Abramovich will create plenty of logistical hurdles for the team just as it is the men&#8217;s team.

But even if that battle doesn&#8217;t produce much drama &#8212; for what it&#8217;s worth, BVB plays at Bayern on April 23 &#8212; the next four spots in the league hierarchy remain completely up for grabs.<\/p>\n<p>Bayer Leverkusen are clinging to third place at 45 points, but <i>Die Werkself<\/i> have dropped eight points in their last four league matches and just lost star playmaker Florian Wirtz to a torn ACL. Meanwhile, three torrid teams stand just a point back &#8212; RB Leipzig have pulled 22 points from its last nine league matches, Freiburg have 14 from seven, and Hoffenheim have 13 from its last five and 30 from its last 15.<\/p>\n<p><b>&#8211; Stream ESPN FC Daily on ESPN+ (U.S. only)<br \/>&#8211; Don&#8217;t have ESPN? Get instant access<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Recent results aren&#8217;t the be-all and end-all of course. Leverkusen have been pretty unlucky of late, and not just in the injuries department. Their +1.5 xG differential per match over the past two months is second in the league to only Bayern&#8217;s (+1.6), and they&#8217;ve pulled just six points from the last seven close matches &#8212; matches decided by either zero or one goal &#8212; that they&#8217;ve played, an unsustainably poor trend. Even without Wirtz, they&#8217;ve still got Patrik Schick (20 goals in all competitions) and Moussa Diaby (16 goals and nine assists) in attack, and their transition game is one of the strongest in the league.<\/p>\n<p>Still, holding on will be difficult. RB Leipzig have solved a lot of their disastrous transition issues in recent weeks, and while neither Freiburg nor Hoffenheim defend very well (even by Bundesliga standards) they boast major attacking firepower and have proven they can take points from the league&#8217;s best teams. Both Leverkusen and Hoffenheim have three remaining matches against top-six teams, while RBL and Freiburg each have two. (Freiburg also play Bayern on April 2, the same day RBL host Borussia Dortmund.)<\/p>\n<p>In short, this one is far from decided.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/soccer\/english-premier-league\/story\/4618228\/\" \/>play<\/p>\n<p>1:13<\/p>\n<p>Steve Nicol feels Everton need to keep their play simple and show some basic fight in order to retain their Premier League status.<\/p>\n<h2><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/leaguelogos\/soccer\/500\/23.png&amp;w=126&amp;site=espnfc\" width=\"50\" \/>5.
