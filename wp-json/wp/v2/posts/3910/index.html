Golden State Warriors<br \/>2021-22 record: 53-29<br \/>Result: NBA champions<br \/>2023 title odds: +500<\/p>\n<p>Fresh off their fourth championship in the past eight seasons, the Warriors have much to celebrate, including the return of Klay Thompson and the emergence of Jordan Poole. Still, they have a big offseason ahead. Golden State has just eight players locked in to its roster, with some key free agents, including Kevon Looney and Gary Payton II, and an option to pick up Andrew Wiggins. The Warriors are already the highest-spending team in the league, and as much as they would like to run it back with this title-winning group, it&#8217;s unclear whether that&#8217;s a possibility.<em> &#8212; Andrews<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nba\/500\/bos.png?w=110&amp;h=110\" width=\"75\" \/><\/p>\n<p>2. Boston Celtics<br \/>2021-22 record: 51-31<br \/>Result: Lost in NBA Finals<br \/>2023 title odds: +600<\/p>\n<p>It was a remarkable turnaround for Boston, which went from being under .500 in late January to within two games of winning an NBA title. Ultimately, though, Boston&#8217;s loss to the Warriors in the NBA Finals was proof of the growth that&#8217;s still left for this group to get where it wants to go &#8211; namely at the offensive end of the court. Turnovers and cold spells offensively proved to be the difference against Golden State, and will be the places Boston looks to improve moving forward. <em>&#8212; Bontemps<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nba\/500\/mil.png?w=110&amp;h=110\" width=\"75\" \/><\/p>\n<p>3.

Yet, playing the postseason without Middleton exposed some of the Bucks&#8217; weaknesses, especially on the wings. For a run at another championship they will need to retool around their best three players: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jrue Holiday and Middleton.<em> &#8212; Collier<\/em><\/p>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nba\/500\/mem.png?w=110&amp;h=110\" width=\"75\" \/><\/p>\n<p>4.

Kleiman has more difficult decisions to make regarding the free agency of Tyus Jones and Kyle Anderson, a pair of veterans who have been quality role players, as well as how aggressive to be in the trade market, where the Grizzlies&#8217; first-round picks acquired in previous deals could be valuable commodities.<em> &#8212; MacMahon<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nba\/500\/dal.png?w=110&amp;h=110\" width=\"75\" \/><\/p>\n<p>5.

He will likely again be Dallas&#8217; second-best player, behind Luka Doncic, as GM Nico Harrison is handcuffed by the Mavs being well into luxury tax territory with limited first-round picks to dangle in trade packages. The Mavs filled one major need by trading for high-scoring center Christian Wood &#8212; a deal that will become official on draft night &#8212; and are expected to target a rotation wing in free agency.<em> &#8212; MacMahon<\/em><\/p>\n<p>MORE: Jalen Brunson&#8217;s star turn has massive free agency implications<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nba\/500\/mia.png?w=110&amp;h=110\" width=\"75\" \/><\/p>\n<p>6.

They also have to wait and see if P.J. Tucker is going to pick up his player option for next season. Both Riley and coach Erik Spoelstra made it clear at the end of the season that they would love to find a way to bring Tucker back, even if he opts out. It remains to be seen what the market is for veteran Victor Oladipo as he continues to work his way back from injuries that derailed his past few seasons. Riley also made it clear that he wants to see veteran point guard Kyle Lowry get into better shape, but the 77-year-old president seems content with bringing the same core back, led by Jimmy Butler.<em> &#8212; Friedell<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nba\/500\/phx.png?w=110&amp;h=110\" width=\"75\" \/><\/p>\n<p>7.

It&#8217;s just a matter of whether he is able to come to an agreement on an extension or Phoenix ends up helping him find a new home via a sign-and-trade. The Suns couldn&#8217;t come to terms with Ayton on an extension last summer, setting up a showdown for this summer when he can become a restricted free agent. Now, that showdown is here.<em> &#8212; Lopez<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nba\/500\/lac.png?w=110&amp;h=110\" width=\"75\" \/><\/p>\n<p>8.

A healthy Leonard and Paul George are as good as any duo in the league, but their supporting cast is arguably deeper than ever. The Clippers&#8217; midseason trade for Norman Powell and Robert Covington added a legit third offensive scorer and another defensive player to a team stacked with them. Coach Ty Lue could play a lineup of all interchangeable parts that can switch defensively with the likes of Nic Batum and Marcus Morris Sr. adding versatility. Reggie Jackson will have more in the tank now that he doesn&#8217;t have to carry the offensive load like he did last season. And Ivica Zubac, Luke Kennard and Terance Mann have shown glimpses of what they can do with bigger opportunities.<em> &#8212; Youngmisuk<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nba\/500\/den.png?w=110&amp;h=110\" width=\"75\" \/><\/p>\n<p>9.

With back-to-back MVP Nikola Jokic, and the returns of Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr., Denver will finally have its full core back together. It&#8217;s not clear, however, if those pieces will be enough with the Nuggets&#8217; supporting cast.

Nets general manager Sean Marks made it clear at his end-of-season press conference that the Nets want players who are committed to being part of the team, and Irving hasn&#8217;t proven that he can be counted on to play every game &#8212; especially after missing the bulk of New York City home games last season after declining to get the COVID-19 vaccination. As the Nets wait to decide what to do with Irving moving forward, they also have to hope that Ben Simmons recovers from back surgery and is able to play at a high level again next season. Veteran center Andre Drummond played well for the Nets after being acquired from Philadelphia in the Simmons trade, but given the money already on the books, it remains unclear whether Brooklyn will be able to re-sign him.<em> &#8212; Friedell<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nba\/500\/phi.png?w=110&amp;h=110\" width=\"75\" \/><\/p>\n<p>11.

Well, anyone, given that&#8217;s been the case for the past eight or nine years now. Next up for the 76ers? Deciding how to proceed with James Harden after making the blockbuster Ben Simmons trade to acquire him at the February trade deadline. Will Harden get the max? Will he pick up his option? Will the two sides compromise on something else? How both sides proceed will be a defining moment for the franchise as superstar center Joel Embiid hits his prime and will be on his own supermax deal for the next several seasons.<em> &#8212; Bontemps<\/em><\/p>\n<p>MORE: James Harden&#8217;s performance reveals the uncertain future for the 76ers&#8217; star duo<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nba\/500\/min.png?w=110&amp;h=110\" width=\"75\" \/><\/p>\n<p>12.

That means the biggest task for new president Tim Connelly is a possible extension for center Karl-Anthony Towns, who is supermax eligible after making the All-NBA third team. Bigger changes may be in store in 2023, when the Timberwolves could create max-level cap room entering the final season of Anthony Edwards&#8217; rookie contract.<em> &#8212; Pelton<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nba\/500\/chi.png?w=110&amp;h=110\" width=\"75\" \/><\/p>\n<p>13.

Now comes the hard part: elevating from being merely good to competing for a championship.

Toronto Raptors<br \/>2021-22 record: 48-34<br \/>Result: Lost in Round 1<br \/>2023 title odds: +6000<\/p>\n<p>Last season was an unqualified success in Toronto, thanks to both Pascal Siakam returning to All-NBA-caliber play and Scottie Barnes being the NBA&#8217;s Rookie of the Year. After getting back into the playoffs, the question now is how to take another step forward in what is an incredibly competitive top of the Eastern Conference. Doing so is going to take an additional infusion of talent for a team that, as of now, is lacking in salary-cap space and extra draft assets to go get it. Still, there are plenty of teams that would be happy to have a core of Siakam, Barnes, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby and Gary Trent.<em> &#8212; Bontemps<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nba\/500\/no.png?w=110&amp;h=110\" width=\"75\" \/><\/p>\n<p>16.

The easiest way to do so is by waiving Danilo Gallinari, who is set to be paid $21.5 million in 2022-23, since only $5 million is guaranteed.

They have the No. 10 pick in the draft.<em> &#8212; Youngmisuk<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2021\/0105\/Article_Placement_1920x1080_ESPN+_%20(1).jpg\" width=\"100%\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Get access to exclusive original series, premium articles from our NBA insiders, the full 30 for 30 library and more. <b>Sign up now to unlock everything ESPN+ has to offer.<\/b><\/p>\n<p> <img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nba\/500\/sac.png?w=110&amp;h=110\" width=\"75\" \/><\/p>\n<p>25. Sacramento Kings<br \/>2021-22 record: 30-52<br \/>Result: Missed postseason<br \/>2023 title odds: +100000<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been an excruciating 16-year drought without a postseason appearance for the Kings franchise. Since Rick Adelman vacated the seat as the most successful coach in Kings history, Sacramento cycled through 11 different coaches before hiring Mike Brown away from the Golden State Warriors&#8217; staff this offseason. The 2008-09 Coach of the Year has made the playoffs in five of his seven years as the top guy, not to mention countless runs as an assistant. Maybe he&#8217;ll be the guy to break the streak.<em> &#8212; McMenamin<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nba\/500\/ind.png?w=110&amp;h=110\" width=\"75\" \/><\/p>\n<p>26. Indiana Pacers<br \/>2021-22 record: 25-57<br \/>Result: Missed postseason<br \/>2023 title odds: +75000<\/p>\n<p>A 25-57 season turned into Indiana&#8217;s highest draft pick (No. 6 overall) since taking Rik Smits No. 2 in 1988. If they get someone who can help immediately, the Pacers could compete for a playoff spot with a full season from deadline pickup Tyrese Haliburton and a healthy Myles Turner to anchor the defense. The forward spots are the biggest need for Indiana, which dealt away Domantas Sabonis to get Haliburton and sees T.J. Warren hit unrestricted free agency after being sidelined since December 2020 by consecutive stress fractures in his left foot.<em> &#8212; Pelton<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nba\/500\/det.png?w=110&amp;h=110\" width=\"75\" \/><\/p>\n<p>27. Detroit Pistons<br \/>2021-22 record: 23-59<br \/>Result: Missed postseason<br \/>2023 title odds: +75000<\/p>\n<p>The Pistons found their centerpiece in the draft one year ago, selecting Cade Cunningham with the No. 1 overall pick. And while their improvements on the court were minimal, Detroit&#8217;s first offseason to build around Cunningham with more talent, and perhaps a true running mate, has arrived.<em> &#8212; Collier<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nba\/500\/okc.png?w=110&amp;h=110\" width=\"75\" \/><\/p>\n<p>28. Oklahoma City Thunder<br \/>2021-22 record: 24-58<br \/>Result: Missed postseason<br \/>2023 title odds: +100000<\/p>\n<p>The 2022 lottery was much kinder to Oklahoma City than the year before, when the Thunder not only dropped to sixth but also saw the Houston Rockets retain their top-three protected pick. This time around, Oklahoma City&#8217;s combination came up second, giving the Thunder a chance to take either Chet Holmgren or Jabari Smith Jr.; Oklahoma City also holds the 12th and 30th picks via trade, likely adding more frontcourt talent to a roster currently built around young guards Luguentz Dort, Josh Giddey and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.<em> &#8212; Pelton<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nba\/500\/hou.png?w=110&amp;h=110\" width=\"75\" \/><\/p>\n<p>29. Houston Rockets<br \/>2021-22 record: 20-62<br \/>Result: Missed postseason<br \/>2023 title odds: +100000<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s still early in the Rockets&#8217; rebuild. Houston needs to land a franchise cornerstone with the No. 3 overall pick to pair with Jalen Green, who had a promising finish to his rookie year. There has been hope that Kevin Porter Jr. can be that type of player, but the Rockets are expected to approach his rookie extension talks with caution &#8212; if at all. After dealing Christian Wood to the Mavericks, Eric Gordon remains as a productive veteran whose best value to the Rockets is probably as trade bait.<em> &#8212; MacMahon<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nba\/500\/orl.png?w=110&amp;h=110\" width=\"75\" \/><\/p>\n<p>30. Orlando Magic<br \/>2020-21 record: 22-60<br \/>Result: Missed postseason<br \/>2023 title odds: +100000<\/p>\n<p>There is finally a little excitement again in Orlando surrounding this young group&#8217;s future. That&#8217;s because the No. 1 pick in next week&#8217;s draft gives more hope to an organization in desperate need of it. No matter which direction the Magic take with the first pick, they have to trust that second-year coach Jamahl Mosley and his staff will continue to develop Markelle Fultz, Wendell Carter Jr., Cole Anthony and Jalen Suggs. On top of the needed improvements from the younger players, the Magic have to trust that Jonathan Isaac will make an impact next year after missing the last two seasons while rehabbing from an ACL injury suffered in the 2020 NBA Bubble.<em> &#8212; Friedell<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Golden State Warriors are the 2022 NBA champions, Stephen Curry has his long-awaited Finals MVP award and the Warriors&#8217; big three of Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green tallied title No. 4.OK, what&#8217;s next?After battling in the Finals, where do the Warriors and Boston Celtics check in for the 2022-23 season?
