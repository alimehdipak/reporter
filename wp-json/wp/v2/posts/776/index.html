Welcome to Tournament Challenge Second Chance, the game that gives you another go at the men&#8217;s bracket, starting with the Sweet 16 games.<\/p>\n<p>All you have to do is select which teams you think will win each of the 15 remaining tournament games that take place from March 24 on.<\/p>\n<p>Just like the original Tournament Challenge game, you will earn points for each game you pick correctly. The point value for a correct pick increases with each round of the tournament, culminating with the championship game on April 4. Once you&#8217;ve made your selections, all you do is sit back and pull for your picks to survive and advance.<\/p>\n<p>This season, getting the top scoring entry in any round of the NCAA Tournament automatically enters you for a chance to win a $10,000! This means that for the championship round, anyone who correctly picks the game&#8217;s winner has a chance at the grand prize. Instead of lamenting your original champion being bounced early, join in to play against friends, family and coworkers, many of whom also had their brackets busted early on.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ve had the chance to see each team play at least a couple of games, so use that to your advantage. Good luck, and may the second time be the charm! Here are some notable tools and articles to check out as the tournament moves along:<\/p>\n<p><em>*Restrictions apply.
