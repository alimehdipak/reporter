His 56th gave the Maple Leafs the victory in overtime and set the record for most goals by a U.S.-born player in a season.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This was Auston&#8217;s night,&#8221; Toronto coach Sheldon Keefe said. &#8220;It&#8217;s much deserved and to finish it with an exclamation point.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Matthews accomplished both feats in only 66 games, and he has netted 49 goals in his past 50 games alone.<\/p>\n<p>Jimmy Carson (1987-88) and Kevin Stevens (1992-93) previously held the record for most goals by a U.S.-born player with 55.<\/p>\n<p>Vaive&#8217;s 54-goal mark, meanwhile, had stood for over 40 years, from the 1981-82 campaign (which was the highest-scoring season in modern NHL history). The 62-year-old former winger knew it was only a matter of time before Matthews came for his mantle.<\/p>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m happy for him, I really am,&#8221; Vaive told ESPN. &#8220;I expected him to do it two years ago. He&#8217;s a generational-type player. It&#8217;s been 40 years that I had that record. I&#8217;m just glad that I&#8217;m around to see it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Toronto&#8217;s first overall pick in 2016, Matthews had 47 goals before the 2019-20 season was shut down due to COVID-19, and he scored 41 goals in the pandemic-shortened 56-game schedule last year.<\/p>\n<p>Matthews scored his first goal on Thursday with a one-timer from the bottom of the circle to the left of goalie Scott Wedgewood after taking a pass back from Mark Giordano on a power play for a 2-1 lead with 1:02 left in the second period. The winner came when Matthews took a pass from William Nylander and was able to swipe the puck around Wedgewood in overtime.<\/p>\n<p>Matthews emphatically pumped his right arm after the goal in the second period that broke the franchise record.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I just saw the puck go in, and I was just so excited, honestly,&#8221; he said. &#8221;There really was not that much else to it. [Giordano] made a really nice pass, and he put it right in my wheelhouse, so I just tried to attack the puck, and I was able to sneak it in. So it was a lot of stuff going through my mind.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Vaive was the first player in Leafs franchise history to score 50 goals, doing so three times in the 1980s. Gary Leeman (1989-90) and Dave Andreychuk (1993-94) were the only others to match Vaive with at least 50 goals, until Matthews crossed the threshold on March 31 against the Winnipeg Jets.<\/p>\n<p>Matthews needed just 62 games to score his 50th goal, making it the fastest 50-goal season since 1995-96.<\/p>\n<p>Now he has set a new benchmark in Toronto, one he could continue building on this year and maybe surpass in seasons to come.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;His skills are outrageous,&#8221; Vaive said. &#8220;It&#8217;s just crazy, how good he is with the puck and how good his shot is. I&#8217;m happy that a guy like him has done this, because it would have been different if it was someone who just happened to have a fluke year and did it [once], whereas he&#8217;s a guy that you can count on probably to get there or close every single year.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Matthews continues to lead the NHL in goals and is on track to win the second consecutive Rocket Richard Trophy of his career. With 50 goals, the Edmonton Oilers&#8217; Leon Draisaitl has been Matthews&#8217; closest competition for the prize that goes to the league&#8217;s leading goal scorer.<\/p>\n<p><em>The Associated Press contributed to this story. <\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Toronto Maple Leafs superstar Auston Matthews made history twice over in Thursday night&#8217;s 4-3 overtime victory at the Dallas Stars.The 24-year-old center scored his 55th goal of the season late in the second period, passing Rick Vaive to claim Toronto&#8217;s single-season goal-scoring record.
