The piece features the brand&#8217;s logo on the front chest, with the initials and jersey number of the four-time WNBA champion stitched on the wrists. The letterman was the brainchild of fashion designer and former USC baseball player John Thomas.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;My two greatest passions are designing clothes [I sew all the garments myself] and supporting women&#8217;s sports.

Thomas designed this jacket as well, and hopes to continue making pieces for WNBA players.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Women&#8217;s sports isn&#8217;t a stepping stone for me, I&#8217;m here to stay.
