Read on to find out what effective sleep apnea treatments are available today.<\/p>\n<h2>What is Sleep Apnea?<\/h2>\n<p>Sleep apnea is a condition that obstructs breathing while you sleep. In other words, this condition causes people to stop breathing during sleep. The duration can vary in frequency and length. Here are two types of sleep apnea:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Obstructive sleep apnea \u2013<\/strong> this condition occurs when your airways are partially or entirely blocked. It\u2019s the most common type of sleep apnea.<br \/>\n<strong>Central sleep apnea \u2013<\/strong> this condition occurs when the brain fails to send proper signals to your respiratory system. This causes a delay or stops breathing.<\/p>\n<h2>Sleep apnea symptoms<\/h2>\n<p>The symptoms associated with sleep apnea are both physical and behavioral, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Insomnia<\/li>\n<li>Short of breath when waking up<\/li>\n<li>Restless sleep<\/li>\n<li>Memory loss<\/li>\n<li>Daytime sleepiness<\/li>\n<li>Loud snoring<\/li>\n<li>Dry mouth when waking up<\/li>\n<li>Mood swings<\/li>\n<li>Lack of focus<\/li>\n<li>Headaches<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In some cases, patients with sleep apnea couldn\u2019t recognize the signs themselves. But their bed partner often identifies the issue because of their partner\u2019s loud snoring or sudden gasping for air.

The breathing obstruction can cause difficulty in breathing significantly for some patients and mildly for others. The treatment options differ with these variations.
