Another helpful distinguisher is that tuxedos have satin accents on the jacket lapel and striping down the side of the pants,\u201d he continued.<\/p>\n<p>The research also discovered that the average person needed 45 minutes to get ready for an event such as a\u00a0wedding\u00a0or charity ball.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhile it may be a bit more difficult to dress for another person\u2019s event or\u00a0wedding, it is important to remember that your\u00a0wedding\u00a0day is all about you,\u201d said Ramirez. \u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity to show off a bit of your personal style with different suit colors, choosing a bow tie or necktie, fun accessories like socks and pocket squares, and everything in between.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>They\u2019re putting their best suit forward.
