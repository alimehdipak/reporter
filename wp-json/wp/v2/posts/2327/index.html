Back then, Tiffany said, the party was a fund-raiser dinner, but in the 1970s, when freshly fired Vogue editor Diana Vreeland started manning the Costume Institute, the gala became linked with whatever fashion exhibit was opening at the museum, \u201cwhich were always completely over the top.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s always been a creative party,\u201d said Dennita Sewell, a fashion professor at Arizona State University who worked at the Costume Institute in the 1990s \u2014 when lower-rung staffers could actually attend the party. \u201cPeople always dressed up, but it wasn\u2019t so extreme \u2026 No one would have done something that wasn\u2019t graceful and elegant.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"792\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/kim-kardashian-met-gala-2021.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Kim Kardashian poses on the red carpet for the 2021 Met Gala.\" \/>Kim Kardashian in Balenciaga in 2021.Justin Lane\/EPA    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe themes were noted,\u201d she added, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t like the whole party was competing with the exhibition.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes it can feel that way.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s gone from an industry event celebrating the history of fashion to one celebrating celebrity,\u201d stylist Tracy Taylor told The Post. \u201cDesigners were really the focus of the galas in the 20th century and early 21st century: Alexander McQueen, Halston \u2014 Halston would have never designed something that you couldn\u2019t sit in!
