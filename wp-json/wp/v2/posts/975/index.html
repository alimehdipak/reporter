By departing at the end of this academic year, Old Dominion, Marshall and Southern Miss broke the Conference USA bylaws that require a 14-month notice before leaving the league.<\/p>\n<p>That caused the legal issues, which came into focus after the Sun Belt had already placed the three schools on the league&#8217;s football schedule for 2022 when it was released on March 1.<\/p>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p>This means that Conference USA will play with 11 members next season. A schedule to reflect the league&#8217;s new structure is expected to be released soon.<\/p>\n<p>Sources told ESPN that the odd number of programs has prompted the league to petition the NCAA for health and safety reasons to play two football games in Week 0 in 2022. Because of the odd number of teams, there&#8217;s a fear too many in the league would have to play for more than two months consecutively without a bye. Playing in Week 0 would help space that out.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Conference USA is excited about the future with our 11 institutions in the 2022-23 academic year, and is committed to the long-term growth of the league as we usher in new members in the coming years,&#8221; Conference USA said in a statement.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s more change on the way for Conference USA, although the timing is uncertain. Six more schools are headed to the American Athletic Conference &#8212; North Texas, Rice, UTSA, Charlotte, FAU and UAB. Conference USA has already announced it is adding Jacksonville State, Liberty, New Mexico State and Sam Houston.<\/p>\n<p>The Sun Belt will be a 14-member league next season, as it also added James Madison in recent months.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>8:36 PM ETPete ThamelESPN The acrimonious departure of Old Dominion, Marshall and Southern Miss from Conference USA to the Sun Belt Conference has been finalized, the latter league announced on Tuesday in a joint statement with the three schools.The schools are officially headed to the Sun Belt for the 2022 football season, ending a spate&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":976,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[13],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/975"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=975"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/975\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=975"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=975"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=975"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
