For every team that&#8217;s still alive in the 2022 NCAA tournament, we picked an all-time starting five &#8212; and we ranked them.<\/p>\n<p>This list is solely based on collegiate production. The goal was to create a traditional lineup that features guards and big men. We couldn&#8217;t pull that off with every school. Bill Walton and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar have to be paired together on UCLA&#8217;s all-time team, right?<\/p>\n<p>We also admit that there are a lot of players who could have cracked these lists. But when you limit yourself to five players, things get more difficult and probably more controversial.<\/p>\n<p>That didn&#8217;t stop us from trying.<\/p>\n<p>Here is our list of the all-time starting fives &#8212;
