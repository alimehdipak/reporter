Stone and LSU teammate Ingrid Lindblad finished in a tie for second place.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just heartbreaking,&#8221; Stone said. &#8220;I kind of knew where I stood on 17, and I was just thinking, par out. I just didn&#8217;t have the right club and kind of left myself with a difficult up-and-down [on 17]. I was trying to be aggressive and just kind of lost it. I thought I could get it back on 18, but I had a lot going on in my head with where I was at.&#8221;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/photo\/2022\/0402\/r994468_1296x1296_1-1.jpg&amp;w=130&amp;h=130&amp;scale=crop&amp;location=center\" width=\"65\" height=\"65\" \/><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>A birdie on the par-3 16th gave Stone the 2-shot lead over Davis. Stone hit the middle of the fairway with her tee shot on the par-4 17th. Her ball was about 135 yards from the hole, on an uphill lie. She was between clubs and opted for a pitching wedge over a 9-iron. Her second shot came up short of the front bunker, leaving her a difficult pitch onto the green.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I just knew I didn&#8217;t want to land in the bunker and [had to] hit it over,&#8221; Stone said.<\/p>\n<p>Stone, from Riverview, Florida, chipped her ball about 40 feet past the hole. She was also aggressive with her first putt, knocking it past the hole. Then she missed a 6-footer for bogey. Her double-bogey 6 dropped her into a tie for the lead with Davis at 1 under.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/chui-assets-cdn.espn.com\/7e4a9cfa-e2d9-4d06-9f3e-6d8c80af2cb3.jpeg\" width=\"100%\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Make your picks and compete for a chance to win $5,000! <b>Make Your Picks<\/b><\/p>\n<p>LSU coach Garrett Runion said chipping isn&#8217;t the strongest part of Stone&#8217;s game. But her shot from below the bunker on the 17th would be difficult for any player at Augusta National &#8212; even the world&#8217;s best playing in next week&#8217;s Masters.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s got to be the largest crowd she&#8217;s ever played in front of and with everything on the line, I don&#8217;t want to speak for her, but I think there&#8217;s probably a lot of nerves going on,&#8221; Runion said.<\/p>\n<p>It was only the second time Stone had ever played the course. She had a rushed practice round at Augusta National on Friday, after bad weather on Thursday pushed the second round at nearby Champions Retreat Golf Club into the next day. After the second round was completed, the field made its way over to Augusta National for a same-day practice round.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/golf\/story\/_\/id\/33655332\/\" \/>Latanna Stone walked away disappointed with her finish after struggling on the final two holes at Augusta National.\u00a0David Cannon\/Getty Images<\/p>\n<p>Still, even after Stone&#8217;s first big mistake of the round, all wasn&#8217;t lost heading into the par-4 18th. She could still win the tournament with a birdie. A par would put her into a playoff with Davis, who was already in the clubhouse with the only under-par score among the 30 players in the finals.<\/p>\n<p>Stone pushed her tee shot into the trees down the right side of the 18th fairway. She punched out and her ball ended up short of the green. The chip-up settled about 12 feet from the hole. Needing a putt to force a playoff, she missed left and made bogey.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t really nervous today,&#8221; Stone said. &#8220;I kind of felt comfortable out there. The first tee shot, I was a little nervous. On 18, I was feeling it a bit because I made a dumb mistake on 17. Other than that, I was really comfortable out there. I was confident, and I thought I played pretty well.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Stone received a loud ovation as she walked off the 18th green.<\/p>\n<p><img data-src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2020\/1105\/r771186_1296x729_16-9.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2020\/1105\/r771186_1296x729_16-9.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Michael Collins is back for an all-new season of America&#8217;s Caddie.
