Gooch is 20th in the standings, Jones is 65th and Swafford is 67th.

They have already been paid to compensate for what they are here complaining about.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>LIV Golf officials said in a statement they were &#8220;disappointed&#8221; at Freeman&#8217;s decision. &#8220;No one gains by banning golfers from playing,&#8221; the statement read.<\/p>\n<p>The PGA Tour said in a statement, &#8220;With today&#8217;s news, our players, fans and partners can now focus on what really matters over the next three weeks: the best players in the world competing in the FedExCup Playoffs, capping off an incredibly compelling season with the crowning of the FedExCup champion at the TOUR Championship.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Gooch, Jones and Swafford and eight other LIV Golf players, including Phil Mickelson and Bryson DeChambeau, filed an antitrust lawsuit against the PGA Tour in federal court last week.<\/p>\n<p>Freeman told attorneys that her court&#8217;s first availability for a trial on the antitrust lawsuit would be September 2023. If that date doesn&#8217;t work, the trial might not happen until 2025. That is significant because LIV players aren&#8217;t currently receiving Official World Golf Ranking points for LIV events.
