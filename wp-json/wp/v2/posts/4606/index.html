At the time, it was A&amp;E\u2019s top-rated series and had just received an additional 160-episode order. <\/p>\n<p>The long-running series \u201cCops,\u201d which aired on Fox for 25 seasons before moving to Spike TV \u2014 which then morphed into Paramount Network \u2014 was canceled the day before \u201cLive PD.\u201d It returned to the streaming service Fox Nation for its 33rd season in October 2021.<\/p>\n<p>At the time of \u201cLive PD\u2019s\u201d cancellation, Abrams tweeted that he was \u201cshocked &amp; beyond disappointed\u201d and vowed \u201cMore to come \u2026\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/on-patrol-live-cropped-5-1.jpg?w=1024\" \/>From left: Sean \u201cSticks\u201d Larkin, Dan Abrams and Deputy Sheriff Curtis Wilson host \u201cOn Patrol: Live.\u201d    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was very clear when the show was taken off that I was disappointed in the decision,\u201d he said. \u201cI understood it, but I felt strongly that the show belonged on the air. There were a number of times where I said on social media that I felt that by the end of 2021 the show would be back on the air \u2026 but it was really important to find the right partner.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe have a lot of people in this community who are into the show and are really invested in it  [and] we didn\u2019t want a short-term commitment. This is a show about being there with the police departments and embedding with them and becoming part of those communities, to some degree.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Abrams said he anticipates that the show\u2019s return will ignite anger in some quarters.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I would expect there will be some backlash, mostly from people who\u2019ve never seen the show,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s OK. Look, policing is controversial, that\u2019s the point of the show, to show police doing what they do, and what they do can be controversial. I\u2019m prepared [for the criticism] and the producers are prepared for it \u2014 but, most importantly, people who watched the show regularly are now really excited about this new version.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Abrams will be joined in the show\u2019s Jersey City studios by his \u201cLive PD\u201d co-host Sean \u201cSticks\u201d Larkin, a retired Tulsa Police Department lieutenant, and by Curtis Wilson, who serves as Deputy Sheriff in the Richland County (South Carolina) Sheriff\u2019s Department. Wilson, who appeared on \u201cLive PD,\u201d is also a news anchor at WOLO TV in Columbia, S.C. and is a host on two local radio stations.<\/p>\n<p>(Original \u201cLive PD\u201d analyst Tom Morris Jr. was asked to return for \u201cOn Patrol: Live\u201d but was unavailable. \u201cThe timing just didn\u2019t work out,\u201d Abrams said.)<\/p>\n<p>The series will air Friday and Saturday nights from 9 p.m. to midnight and will include several new elements, including \u201cCitizen Ride-Alongs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt allows a combination of people who are watching the show, who happen to live in the communities we cover, to go on ride-alongs and report back to us on how it was \u2026 and if there was anything behind-the-scenes that we were missing,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cI think that\u2019s an upgrade for the show.\u201d The people who participate in the ride-alongs will appear on-camera during those episodes, and will also join Abrams, Larkin and Wilson in the studio for a \u201cCitizens On-Set\u201d segment to share their experiences.<\/p>\n<p>Friday\u2019s series opener will feature the Paterson Police Dept. (Paterson, NJ); Beech Grove Police Department (Beech Grove, IN); Berkeley County Sheriff\u2019s Office (Moncks Corner, SC); Bernalillo County Sheriff\u2019s Office (Albuquerque, NM); Marion County Sheriff\u2019s Office (Ocala, Fla.); Nye County Sheriff\u2019s Office (Pahrump, NV); Richland County Sheriff\u2019s Office (Columbia, SC); and Volusia County Sheriffs Office (Fla).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOn Patrol: Live\u201d will also work with the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a really important part of the show,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cOne of the things I was most proud of on the old show was how powerful that segment was in helping to find missing kids [and] wanted criminals.\u201d The show will also partner with other organizations that will be announced at a later date.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s important, when people do analysis about shows coming back, and why this one was on or off the air, to understand that \u2018Live PD\u2019 was longer-form; it was sometimes slow \u2014 we\u2019re watching a traffic stop and sometimes that\u2019s all that happens,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s OK, because that\u2019s part of what this show is \u2026 this is watching police officers in action, watching situations unfold.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think in an era where people are generally more supportive of body cameras on police officers, on both sides now, that people would say this is a good thing to see more police in action.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cLive PD,\u201d which was canceled in 2020, returns July 22 on Reelz as \u201cOn Patrol: Live\u201d \u2014 with Dan Abrams once again anchoring the real-time series that follows police officers on patrol&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":4607,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[5],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4606"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/6"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4606"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4606\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4606"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4606"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4606"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
