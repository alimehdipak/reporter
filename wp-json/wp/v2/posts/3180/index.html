This post will explain the different options in dental implants so you are fully informed and prepared to make a choice about your dental implant preferences.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>What are Dental Implants?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dental Implants are an excellent solution for people who are missing one or more teeth. They are also used to replace lost teeth in cases of tooth decay, gum disease, and other reasons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The five different types of dental implants this post will detail include:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Endosteal Implants\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Subperiosteal Implants<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All-on-4 dental implants<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Implant Overdentures<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Implant-supported bridges<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><b>Endosteal Implants<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The primary type of endosteal implants are held in the jawbone, and they can hold together teeth or bridges. Patients that need a replacement tooth can use these implants to hold it in place.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Subperiosteal Implants<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A subperiosteal implant is often the best way to replace a tooth when there isn&#8217;t enough bone on which to support a dental implant. A subperiosteal implant goes onto or above the jaw and can be used effectively in this situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>All-on-4 Dental Implants<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pulling your tooth and leaving you with dentures? An All-On 4 dental implant can give you the appearance of natural-looking teeth. A small titanium screw is placed into your jaw as a replacement root for your missing tooth. This requires a small surgery, and after that, a crown is connected to create a very real-looking tooth. The All-On 4 implant uses 4 implants per jaw, not just one.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Implant Overdentures\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re healthy enough for tooth extractions, implant overdentures are a great alternative to traditional dentures. The benefits of overdentures often include an easier time chewing foods, improved speech, minimized discomfort, and no more denture adhesive, and\/or existing dentures can be used.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Implant-Supported Bridges<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are missing one or more teeth, don\u2019t have enough jawbone to support an implant, or a nerve is nearby, then implant-supported bridges might be the best option. An implant-supported bridge has three pieces.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The implant<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The abutment<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The restoration<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good news is that if you have an implant-supported bridge, it can reduce the pressure on individual implants caused by grinding your teeth. As for a timeline, after an initial consult, you will go through a first surgery followed by a second. Once the implant is healed, you\u2019ll have a final visit to attach your permanent bridge.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>What Should I Expect After a Dental Implant Procedure?\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dailygram.com\/index.php\/blog\/1023184\/dental-implants-procedure-types-problems\/\">Dental implants<\/a> can produce discomfort, bleeding, swelling, and bruising for the patient. The process of dental implants requires time and patience. It is common for people to need pain management or antibiotics after their first surgery. To experience success with dental implants, it&#8217;s important to take excellent care of your teeth, visit your dentist regularly, and avoid chewing ice or hard candy<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Missing teeth?
