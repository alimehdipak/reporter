Elegant and sophisticated but also ultraglam.<\/p>\n<p>First piece of jewelry: Though I\u2019m Jewish, I bought a St. Christopher medal at the Vatican for good luck in my travels. Regardless of religion, I figured it couldn\u2019t hurt.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>First jewelry splurge: When I got my job at Town &amp; Country I bought myself a vintage steel Rolex Datejust, inspired by my menswear idols Steve McQueen and Paul Newman. It gave me a boost of confidence.<\/p>\n<p>Secret tip: My favorite piece to recommend is the Buccellati Hawaii earring. It\u2019s a lot of look, while still light and comfortable to wear, and can be worn day or night.<\/p>\n<p>Dream jewel: I\u2019m currently obsessed with zodiac medallions. Van Cleef\u2019s new versions in hard stones like lapis and tiger\u2019s eye are the ultimate dream. <\/p>\n<p>The LA-based founder of men\u2019s lifestyle website Leo (below left) was born in Rome, raised in Paris and is a fashion stylist for A-listers Rami Malek, Dwayne Johnson and Tom Hiddleston.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/iliana-urbinati-rami-malek.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"David Yurman Renaissance pearl earrings in 18-k yellow gold with diamonds, $6,200 at London Jewelers\" \/>David Yurman Renaissancepearl earrings in 18-k yellow gold with diamonds, $6,200 at London JewelersNY Post photo composite    <\/p>\n<p>Instagram followers: 237,000<\/p>\n<p>Signature jewel style: Very minimal.<\/p>\n<p>Iconic red-carpet moment: The beautiful Cartier lapel pin Rami Malek (above) just wore to the 2022 Oscars. The brand received so many calls about it afterward!<\/p>\n<p>First piece of jewelry: A little gold Virgin Mary pendant from my grandparents at my First Communion.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>First jewelry splurge: I have a lot of beautiful David Yurman pieces that I love, including gorgeous pearl earrings with diamonds and a light-green peridot pair of oversize studs. Also my IWC pilot watch.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Secret tip: Gold hoops make everyone look more youthful. I wear oversized diamond studs for a rich-bitch look; gold hoops for a sexier, more youthful, gypsy vibe; and pearls for a chic lady look. I prefer earrings to any other jewelry because they frame the face. Missoma makes all my favorite affordable jewelry and the greatest hoops at great prices.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Dream jewel: My David Yurman emerald-and-diamond wedding band. I\u2019ll be very excited to finally get to wear it after our wedding later this year.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Head of jewels for the Americas at Phillips, NYC-based Thomeier (below left) shares her top picks and discerning insights on the auction house\u2019s popular Instagram.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/sara-thomeier-deepika-padukone.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Messika by Kate Moss 18-k yellow-gold\u00a0head jewel with malachite and diamonds, price upon request at London Jewelers\" \/>Messika by Kate Moss 18-k yellow-gold\u00a0head jewel with malachite and diamonds, price upon request at London JewelersNY Post photo composite    <\/p>\n<p>Instagram followers: 28,000<\/p>\n<p>Iconic red-carpet moment: Deepika Padukone (above) at the 2017 Met Gala. This was my fave of all time \u2014 jewels in the hair, killer earrings, embellished straps and a sexy, second-skin gown. <em>Magnifique<\/em>!<\/p>\n<p>First piece of jewelry: When I was just a girl, my mom gave me a gold charm bracelet, and for birthdays and big events, she and my dad would gift me a charm. Now I have three of them overflowing (it\u2019s been a charmed life)! It\u2019s a great way to feel close to the people and places dear to my heart.<\/p>\n<p>First jewelry splurge: A pair of Cartier diamond stud earrings. They were more than I could afford, but I wanted big ones! I\u2019ve gotten lots of mileage out of them, so I\u2019ve never regretted it for a second.<\/p>\n<p>Secret tip: If you\u2019re creative, your jewels can be transformed. Slide a few coordinating brooches onto a thick snake chain \u2014 it becomes a fun and funky statement necklace. You can make earrings into hair ornaments, while a pretty ribbon secured to the ends of a great strap bracelet can convert it to a choker.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Dream jewel: One day I\u2019d love to have a beautiful Deco-era Cartier bandeau. Messika is creating an incredible collection of modern tiaras with the classic design aesthetic of the golden years, so that would do quite well, too!\u00a0 <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Town &amp; Country contributing editor and style writer (below left) has amassed a cult following for his imaginative posts featuring\u00a0 jewelry shot on spiral-bound notebooks.
