Period,\u201d Burry said in the tweet, which has since been deleted.<\/p>\n<p>Burry regularly deletes his old tweets and occasionally deactivates his entire Twitter account. His firm, Scion Capital Management, did not immediately return a request for further comment.<\/p>\n<p>Musk disclosed his 9% ownership stake in Twitter this week after repeatedly bashing the social media platform\u2019s content moderation policies in the past. The Tesla CEO already has a board seat and has pledged to work with Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal to \u201cmake significant improvements\u201d at the company.<\/p>\n<h2>Acquisition limit<\/h2>\n<p>Musk spent nearly $2.9 billion to acquire about 73.5 million shares of Twitter stock. Under the terms of his agreement with Twitter\u2019s board, Musk\u2019s term as a director runs through 2024 and he is barred from acquiring more than 14.9% of the company.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the company reached $5.08 billion in revenue at the end of last year, up 37% from the previous year. User numbers increased 13% to about 217 million daily users.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMusk, who clearly enjoys the platform with his sometimes controversial and always entertaining tweets, brings an air of excitement to the company,\u201d said analyst Daniel Newman of Futurum Research, an advisory business that focuses on digital technology. \u201cHis larger role in the company could pave the way for more user growth and a likely better-than-average market performance as investors will be betting on his contributions to the company\u2019s next wave of growth.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/Michael-Burry-70.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Michael Burry\" \/>Michael Burry\u2019s firm took a short position in Tesla last year.Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>Burry praised Musk\u2019s investment despite clashing with the tech entrepreneur in the past. Scion Asset Management took a short position on Tesla in late 2020 and expanded the bet against the firm last year \u2013 with Burry tweeting at one point that he found the company\u2019s valuation \u201cridiculous.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/elon-musk-76-2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Elon Musk\" \/>Elon Musk also snagged a seat on Twitter\u2019s board of directors.Bloomberg via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>By October 2021, Burry revealed he no longer held a short position on Tesla. A month later, he resurfaced with another dig at Musk \u2013 claiming the billionaire was selling Tesla stock late last year to cash out as shares plummeted.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s face it. @elonmusk borrowed against 88.3 million shares, sold all his mansions, moved to Texas, and is asking @BernieSanders whether he should sell more stock. He doesn\u2019t need cash. He just wants to sell $TSLA,\u201d Burry said at the time.<\/p>\n<p>Burry\u2019s comments drew a sharp response from Musk, who called him a \u201cbroken clock.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cBig Short\u201d investor Michael Burry touted Elon Musk\u2019s purchase of a sizable stake in Twitter as a net positive for the US \u2013 putting aside his occasionally frosty relationship with Tesla\u2019s billionaire&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":1238,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[14],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1237"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1237"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1237\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1237"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1237"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1237"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
