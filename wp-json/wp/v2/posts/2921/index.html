This exam goes deeper on virtually every topic covered in the SIE Exam. Hence, almost everyone has a harder time with the Series 7 exam than the SIE Exam.<\/p>\n<p>Which series exam is the hardest?<\/p>\n<p>The Series 7 exam is by far the longest and most difficult of all the securities exams. It lasts for 225 minutes and covers all aspects of stock and bond quotes and trading; put and call options; spreads and straddles; ethics; margin, and other account holder requirements; and other pertinent regulations.<\/p>\n<p>How hard is the s66?<\/p>\n<p>Is the Series 66 Exam Difficult? Relative to other securities exams, the Series 66 exam is considered more difficult than the SIE and Series 63 exams, but not as difficult as the Series 65 exam.<\/p>\n<p>Is the 65 or 66 Harder?<\/p>\n<p>Is It Harder to Pass the Series 65 or Series 66 Exams? While the pass\/fail rate for these exams is not publicly available, many consider the Series 66 exam more difficult than the Series 65 because it is longer. The Series 65 contains 130 questions and the Series 66 has only 100.<\/p>\n<h3>Is Series 65 or 66 easier?<\/h3>\n<p>Time given to complete exams: The FINRA gives 2 hours and 30 minutes to finish the series 66 exam and 3 hours to finish the series 65 exam. Passing score: You need a 73\/100 to pass the series 66 and a 94\/130 to pass the series 65 exam.<\/p>\n<p>What does a Series 66 license allow you to do?<\/p>\n<p>The Series 66 license is a state-specific license that allows license holders to act as financial advisors and transaction coordinators for securities-based products. It is regulated by NASAA, which provides the steps to becoming licensed.<\/p>\n<p>How long does it take to study for Series 66?<\/p>\n<p>The Series 66 experts at Knopman Marks Financial Training recommend that you plan on 75-100 hours of prep time before your test. You should assume you\u2019ll need about 4-8 weeks of prep time if you\u2019re working full time.<\/p>\n<p>Can you take series 66 without a sponsor?<\/p>\n<p>Do I need to have a sponsor before I take the Series 63, 65, or 66? No. Unsponsored candidates who are not Form U4 registered or currently affiliated with a firm through FINRA\u2019s Web CRD system can open an exam enrollment window via FINRA.org request and pay for the S63, S65, or S66 exam.<\/p>\n<h3>Why is the Series 7 so hard?<\/h3>\n<p>It is a corequisite of the SIE exam, which tests you on general securities topics. By contrast, the questions on the Series 7 exam are detailed and related to the day-to-day activities, responsibilities, and job functions of stockbrokers. Therefore, it can be considered a challenging exam.<\/p>\n<p>Which is harder CPA or Series 7?<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to the tests, Series 7 covers municipal fund securities, corporate securities, solicitation, and more. It has about a 65% pass rate. Comparatively, the CPA exam covers business concepts, financial accounting and reporting, regulation and auditing\/attestation. Both are broad, difficult tests.<\/p>\n<p>What is the pass rate for Series 65?<\/p>\n<p>The Premium course is a great value for students who want to be assured they have everything it takes to pass the Series 65 exam. While Kaplan does not offer a money-back guarantee, it publishes a Series 65 pass rate of 88%, which should give students confidence in their study materials.<\/p>\n<p>Is STC good for Series 66?<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve used it for any prior FINRA or NASAA exams then you will be very familiar with the user interface for the Series 66. STC does a good job in organizing their textbook, but in our view their practice exams, and the interface of their online questions leave a lot to be desired.<\/p>\n<p>How do I take the Series 66 exam?<\/p>\n<p>In order to take the Series 66 exam, you must be a Series 7 license holder, or be taking the Series 7 license exam concurrently with the Series 66 license exam.

However, the Series 7 exam is a co-requisite to the Series 66 exam.<\/p>\n<p>How hard is Series 7?<\/p>\n<p>Is the Series 7 Exam Difficult? Clocking in at 125 questions to be answered in three hours and 45 minutes, the Series 7 exam is considered the most difficult of all the securities licensing exams. The minimum passing score is 72, which may not seem that difficult.<\/p>\n<p>Can you get a Series 7 without a sponsor?<\/p>\n<p>Yes, although the more natural progression is to take the SIE exam first, mainly because you don\u2019t have to be sponsored to take it. The SIE and Series 7 top-off exams are \u201cco-requisites,\u201d which means you can take and pass them in any order. Of course, you have to pass both to earn your Series 7 license.<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Overall, the Series 66 difficulty level is a step up from the SIE Exam difficulty, but it can be easily accomplished with a disciplined approach.
