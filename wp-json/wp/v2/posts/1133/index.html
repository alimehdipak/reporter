After news of the scandal broke much later, New York players took aim at the Astros, with Judge asserting they &#8220;cheated and you didn&#8217;t earn it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In my opinion, I don&#8217;t think he needs to say anything to us,&#8221; Judge said Sunday. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a lot of respect for Beltran, he helped me a lot during his time here as a player. Learned a lot of good lessons. He spent a lot of quality time just kind of talking to me about the game, the mental side of the game, his approaches, how to be a good teammate.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p>Beltran retired as a player after the 2017 season. He played with the Yankees in 2014 and 2015 and a part of 2016.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d love to talk to him,&#8221; Judge said. &#8220;It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve seen him. Just getting a chance to catch up with him and see what he&#8217;s up to because we&#8217;re to be seeing a lot of him during the year. Just looking forward to having him back around because he was a big part of this team, a big part of baseball, what he brings to the game and what he&#8217;s going to bring to the YES Network is going to be big time.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In an interview to air Monday on the YES Network, Beltran said there is a stain on the Astros&#8217; title.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Looking back now, yes, we did cross the line,&#8221; Beltran said. &#8220;We all did what we did. Looking back, we were wrong.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Beltran was named the Mets&#8217; manager before the 2020 season but never managed a game after being let go due to the scandal.<\/p>\n<p>Judge said he is looking ahead and not back at 2017.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t speak for the whole group, but I think the things that we&#8217;ve got to focus on this year and the things we&#8217;ve got to do this year are more important than anything that happened in the past,&#8221; Judge said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a lot of important things, a lot of good things going on this year, so I&#8217;m just going to focus on what we&#8217;ve got to do with that. If he sees anything, if he&#8217;s got any advice that can help us, I&#8217;ll definitely be talking to him.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>TAMPA, Fla, &#8212; There are plenty of things Carlos Beltran needs to do once he begins his job as a New York Yankees announcer on Monday.Become familiar with the YES Network setting.
