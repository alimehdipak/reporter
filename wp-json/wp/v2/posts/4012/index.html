But of course I had a great time, an unbelievable time, and since my first day I really, really enjoyed training, playing, at Anfield especially and in front of these amazing supporters. Now it&#8217;s come to the end, so what can you say?<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;From the first day I came to the club, I spoke to the boss when I was in Southampton, and I think at that time we were not even in the Champions League. He called me and I said, &#8216;For sure.&#8217; I just decided in my heart that I am coming to Liverpool because that is where I see myself, and for me it was the right time and the right club to achieve everything.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;So, I can say of course we won a lot and I spent a great, great time there. An unbelievable time at Liverpool, we won a lot. Like I always say, my life is always [about a] challenge and when it came I said to the club that I want to leave, I want to go somewhere else to see a new challenge. It is not anything else, it is just a challenge because for me I want to always be challenging myself to get better and better.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Stats show how much Liverpool will miss Mane<\/p>\n<h2>PAPER GOSSIP (by Adam Brown)<\/h2>\n<p>&#8211; Real Madrid are open to allowing Takefusa Kubo leave, but they would like to include a buy-back clause as part of any deal, writes Mundo Deportivo.
