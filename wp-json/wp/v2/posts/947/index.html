The lowest-price tier, PlayStation Plus Essential, looks like Sony\u2019s current offering.<\/p>\n<p>PlayStation Plus Extra adds a catalog of PS4 and PS5 games. PlayStation Plus Premium offers a further library of older titles, cloud streaming in major markets and time-limited game trials.<\/p>\n<p>Such streamlining is \u201coverdue,\u201d said Lewis Ward, head of gaming research at IDC.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe number of PlayStation subscribers in the higher two tiers \u2026 will tick up over time, which is undoubtedly a core reason for this change,\u201d Ward said.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/sony-game-pass-30.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Microsoft's Game Pass service\" \/>Sony\u2019s newly announced pricing is seen as competitive with Microsoft\u2019s Game Pass service.Bloomberg via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>Given the high cost of developing new games, analysts had raised concerns that pressure to bundle more content with subscriptions may eat into profit at Sony\u2019s coveted games unit.<\/p>\n<p>Sony will seek to preserve new game sales alongside the subscription service.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think this move should improve margins, as more gamers will be driven to higher-cost subscriptions,\u201d said Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games research at Ampere Analysis.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf content acquisition costs do increase, Sony will need to balance that with the additional revenue it will be generating from the PS Plus subscriber base,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>Sony\u2019s newly announced pricing is seen as competitive. The premium tier\u2019s $120 annual fee compares with $180 for Game Pass Ultimate. Both offer cloud gaming, with Sony users able to stream titles to their consoles and PC.<\/p>\n<p>Cloud gaming is seen as the future for the industry because it doesn\u2019t require downloading or installing games on a console or PC. That is a potential threat to the console business, whose operators have acted as industry gatekeepers.<\/p>\n<p>An annual subscription to the mid-tier PlayStation Plus Extra, which lacks this cloud-gaming feature, works out at just over $8 monthly, compared with $9.99 for the Game Pass.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sony Group\u2019s\u00a0revamp of its PlayStation subscription service is a major step toward levelling the playing field with Microsoft\u2019s rival Game Pass, although holding back new releases may dampen enthusiasm, analysts say.
