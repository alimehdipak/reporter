Lea, who is in his second season as head coach after spending three seasons as defensive coordinator at Notre Dame, sees a path to prosperity.<\/p>\n<p>But he made no secret about how there are &#8220;no cheat codes&#8221; and getting there will require &#8220;going the long, hard way.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are engaged in what has become a unique form of team building,&#8221; Lea said. &#8220;We are a relationship-driven, student-athlete-focused program that values the holistic development of our people over all else. To us, this isn&#8217;t an antiquated concept. It still matters. When you do the right things, the right way, with the right people, with respect and appreciation, you will not be denied.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re smart in design and disciplined in your approach, you win out in time. That&#8217;s Vanderbilt football.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Lea said he learned from the experience of last season and wants to get better at managing the tactical aspects of games. Vanderbilt&#8217;s only wins came out of conference against Colorado State and UConn.<\/p>\n<p>But when Vanderbilt opens fall camp in the coming weeks, one benefit Lea will have is knowing exactly who is his starting quarterback.<\/p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Lea named Mike Wright the starter, calling him one of the best QBs in the country when it comes to mobility.<\/p>\n<p>In 10 games last season, Wright threw eight touchdowns and six interceptions. He rushed for 376 yards, averaging 4.1 yards on 91 carries.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We want him to develop as a total quarterback, which he has,&#8221; Lea said. &#8220;He&#8217;s demonstrated leadership abilities, too. We&#8217;re excited for him to enter the fall as our starting quarterback. He knows that he has to earn that every day. That&#8217;s part of our covenant.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Vanderbilt opens the season Aug. 27 at Hawai&#8217;i.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>ATLANTA &#8212; Vanderbilt coach Clark Lea is undeterred by last season&#8217;s 2-10 record or the program&#8217;s eight consecutive seasons finishing below .500.At SEC media days on Tuesday, Lea made a bold proclamation about the future of Commodores football.&#8221;We know in time Vanderbilt football will be the best program in the country,&#8221; he said.Never mind that&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":4609,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[13],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4608"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4608"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4608\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4608"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4608"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4608"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
