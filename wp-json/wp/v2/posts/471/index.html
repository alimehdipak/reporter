And for the second straight season, the top-ranked Zags remain the consensus favorite among both ESPN&#8217;s panel of men&#8217;s college basketball commentators, analysts and writers &#8212; albeit by a smaller margin than in 2021 when Gonzaga entered the field at a perfect 26-0.<\/p>\n<p>Last season, ESPN&#8217;s panel identified just four teams it thought could cut down the nets on the tournament&#8217;s third weekend &#8212; two of those were Gonzaga and Baylor, who met for the national championship (Illinois and Florida State were the others). This season, ESPN&#8217;s respondents have selected 10 different teams as potential champions, from a field that includes a whopping 18 selected Final Four teams. There were at least four teams picked in every region as Final Four entries in 2022, including a total of five teams in the wide-open South and East Regions.<\/p>\n<p>Below we take a look at several trends among the 54 ESPN professionals who made their picks to reach Caesars Superdome in New Orleans on April 2 &#8212; and their selections for who will cut down the nets on April 4.<\/p>\n<p>Brackets are open!

Though the Blue Devils have five potential first-round NBA draft choices and beat Gonzaga way back on Nov. 26 in Las Vegas, ESPN respondents were either scared off by Duke&#8217;s shaky play over the past couple of weeks or truly impressed with the recent play of Gonzaga. Or both.<\/p>\n<p>ESPN&#8217;s Basketball Power Index gives Mark Few&#8217;s team a 56.9% chance to reach the Final Four, the best percentage in this field. No. 3 seed Texas Tech (15.5%), No. 2 seed Duke (15.0%) and No. 5 seed UConn (5.3%) have the next-best probabilities of coming out of the West. Curiously, No. 4 seed Arkansas (an Elite Eight team a year ago) was not selected by any of ESPN&#8217;s respondents to emerge from the West and is given just a 2.2% chance of reaching New Orleans by BPI.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/i\/infographics\/20170710_nfl_fpr\/charts\/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\" \/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/ncaa\/500\/96.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Kentucky is the heavy consensus choice &#8230; and Baylor is barely a factor<\/h2>\n<p>The Kentucky Wildcats rejoined the national conversation in a major way this season, with John Calipari assembling a team that our respondents believe will end a UK Final Four drought that dates back to 2015. Kentucky was the pick out of the East in 37 of 54 brackets, with No. 4 UCLA (9 picks) and No. 3 Purdue (6 picks) the next-most popular selections.<\/p>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps surprisingly, the No. 1-seeded defending national champion Baylor Bears scarcely made a ripple with ESPN&#8217;s panel. Play-by-play professional Ted Emrich was the only selector who went with the 1-seed in the East, with the Bears getting the same amount of Final Four love as Saint Mary&#8217;s (picked for the Final Four by college football writer and sometimes hoops\/tennis\/soccer guy Bill Connelly).<\/p>\n<p>BPI indeed favors Kentucky (30.2%) to come out of the East but likes Baylor <i>much<\/i> more than our human consensus, projecting Scott Drew&#8217;s group at 26.7% to reach the Final Four. Purdue (16.9%) and UCLA (16.0%) are next in the region. Saint Mary&#8217;s is at 1.3% per BPI (sorry, Bill).<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/i\/infographics\/20170710_nfl_fpr\/charts\/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\" \/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/ncaa\/500\/12.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>The South is anybody&#8217;s ballgame (but mostly Arizona&#8217;s)<\/h2>\n<p>Like the East, the South Region generated five different predictions to reach the Final Four, and also generated a significant amount of support for one team.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a1.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2022%2F0312%2Fr985268_608x342_16-9.jpg\" width=\"100%\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Watch every Men&#8217;s NCAA Tournament game live! <b>March Madness Live<\/b><\/p>\n<p>No. 1 seed Arizona (29 picks) was the top choice, but perhaps concerns over Kerr Kriisa&#8217;s injury helped generate additional counter-support for 3-seed and SEC champ Tennessee (13 picks), Villanova (6 picks), Houston (4 picks) and Illinois (2 picks).<\/p>\n<p>It should be noted that of Houston&#8217;s four ESPN votes of confidence to reach the third weekend, three came from professional basketball analytics-knowers John Gasaway, Paul Sabin and Seth Walder (the other came from esteemed broadcaster Robert Lee). That jibes with BPI&#8217;s data on Houston &#8212; the No. 5 seed Cougars have the sixth-best probability in the entire field to reach the Final Four, per BPI (26.1%), slightly better than Arizona&#8217;s Final Four probability (25.2%) and the best of any non-1 or 2-seed.<\/p>\n<p>Tennessee (23.9% to reach the Final Four), Villanova (17%) and Illinois (4.3%) are next in the South Region in terms of BPI probability.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/i\/infographics\/20170710_nfl_fpr\/charts\/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\" \/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/ncaa\/500\/2305.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Sticking with chalk &#8230; Rock Chalk<\/h2>\n<p>The Midwest was the third of four regions where the most popular ESPN selection was the No. 1 seed, as Kansas (27 picks) was the consensus favorite, followed by red-hot 5-seed Iowa (15 picks), 2-seed Auburn (11 picks) and a solitary pick for Wisconsin from ESPN college football and hoops writer and possible Johnny Davis appreciator David Hale.<\/p>\n<p>BPI also loves Kansas, giving the Jayhawks a 30.9% chance of reaching New Orleans &#8212; second to only Gonzaga in probability. Auburn (26.5%) has the second-best Final Four probability in the region, and BPI was not quite as bullish as ESPN respondents on the chances of the Hawkeyes (no second-weekend trips this millennium) reaching the third weekend (21%). Wisconsin (4.2%) has the longest Final Four odds of any 3-seed.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/i\/infographics\/20170710_nfl_fpr\/charts\/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\" \/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/ncaa\/500\/2250.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>It&#8217;s the Zags again for the title &#8230; but it&#8217;s far from unanimous<\/h2>\n<p>A total of 23 ESPN respondents picked Gonzaga to win the 2022 national championship &#8212; which would be the school&#8217;s first &#8212; a response that aligns with the Zags&#8217; BPI-best 23.5% probability of winning the title.
