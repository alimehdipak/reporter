He was reportedly sentenced to six months house arrest and required to give up any union job for at least three years.<\/p>\n<p>He appears to have returned to the union by 2019, earning a whopping $341,000 as a \u201ckey employee\u201d that year, according to the group\u2019s tax forms.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking to The Post on Monday, IBOTU attorney Steven Kern said Scalza was no longer with the union. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI remember the name, I know I must\u2019ve done something with him in the past, 20 years or so ago\u201d Kern said of Scalza. \u201cSo he did something wrong and he pled guilty and was convicted or whatever and he\u2019s not with the union.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/amazon-32.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Amazon union\" \/>The Bayonne, New Jersey effort is not affiliated with the Amazon Labor Union, which recently won a union election at a warehouse in Staten Island.

However, a jury later cleared Hasho in the case, court papers show. <\/p>\n<p>Before he worked as the union\u2019s president, Hasho was also arrested and arraigned in 1975 in a separate alleged union bribery scheme, the New York Times reported, although the outcome from that case is unclear from available court archives. <\/p>\n<p>According to tax filings, Hasho recently served as the union\u2019s \u201cPres Emeritus\u201d and took home compensation worth more than $1 million in 2018 and $810,000 in 2019 before he died in September 2021.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>By comparison, the president of the National Education Association \u2014 the largest union in the United States \u2014 took home less than $400,000 in 2018.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Asked whether ex-union officials\u2019 records could scare off would-be Amazon union members, Kern said, \u201cI can\u2019t speak to specific accusations.
