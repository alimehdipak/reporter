Spoelstra said the team was unaware if there was a specific cause of the injury in Game 4, or if it was the result of general wear and tear.<\/p>\n<p>Butler had been dominant in the series thus far, averaging 30.5 points &#8212; second most in the postseason behind only Nikola Jokic of the Denver Nuggets &#8212; on 54.3% shooting (43.8% from 3), 7.8 rebounds, 5.3 assists and 2.8 steals as Miami built a 3-1 lead over the Hawks.<\/p>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p>Miami was also without Kyle Lowry, who has yet to return from a left hamstring strain suffered in Game 3.<\/p>\n<p>The Heat handled the Hawks 110-86 in Game 4 with backup point guard Gabe Vincent posting 11 points and four assists in Lowry&#8217;s place.<\/p>\n<p>Miami started former All-Star Victor Oladipo &#8212; who made his series debut with 6 points and 8 rebounds in Game 4 &#8212; in Butler&#8217;s place Tuesday night, alongside Vincent, Max Strus, P.J. Tucker and Bam Adebayo.<\/p>\n<p>Miami went 15-10 in the regular season without Butler and have gone 13-7, including Game 4 in Atlanta, without Lowry.<\/p>\n<p>The Heat played only three games without the both of them, going 1-2.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not wrapping our mind around trying to win for weeks [without them],&#8221; Spoelstra said. &#8220;We&#8217;re wrapping our mind around just winning one game and we&#8217;ve had a lot of different variations of our rotation that&#8217;s given our team confidence to be able to handle the things that sometimes are unpredictable. And we&#8217;ve gained a lot of confidence to be able to figure out ways to win, regardless of who is playing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Hawks coach Nate McMillan said that Atlanta could change its rotation to match how the Heat make up for Butler&#8217;s presence.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We have to make some adjustments with [Butler] out of the lineup,&#8221; McMillan said during his pregame news conference. &#8220;He does a lot for them.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><i>Andscape&#8217;s Marc J.
