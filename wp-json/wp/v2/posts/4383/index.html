Last season the league built in a pause for about three weeks after its All-Star break to accommodate players participating in the Winter Olympics, something that ended up not happening due to COVID-19 postponements and concerns about player safety in Beijing. This season the NHL&#8217;s All-Star weekend &#8212; hosted by the Florida Panthers &#8212; falls on Feb. 3 and 4.<\/p>\n<p>The last scheduled day for the regular season is April 13; last season, it was May 1.<\/p>\n<p>There is one quirk to the schedule when it comes to the NHL&#8217;s signature regular-season game: The Winter Classic. The matchup between the Pittsburgh Penguins and Boston Bruins at Fenway Park will be played Jan. 2 rather than the traditional New Year&#8217;s Day. That&#8217;s because Jan. 1 falls on an NFL Sunday. It&#8217;s only the third time since the outdoor event began in 2008 that it won&#8217;t be played on New Year&#8217;s Day.<\/p>\n<h2>Panic! At The Cup Celebration<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/nhl\/story\/_\/id\/34202285\/\" \/>The Stanley Cup Final rematch between the Avalanche and Lightning will have to wait until Feb. 9.\u00a0Bruce Bennett\/Getty Images<\/p>\n<p>The NHL likes to start off its season with the Stanley Cup champions raising their newest banner, just as the Tampa Bay Lightning did to kick off the 2021-22 season. Alas, the Colorado Avalanche will not raise their banner Oct. 11 because their home, Ball Arena, is booked that night with a Panic! At The Disco concert. Instead, the Avalanche will celebrate their first Stanley Cup since 2001 on Oct. 12, before their game against the Chicago Blackhawks. Well, this calls for a toast. So pour the champagne, pour the champagne &#8230;<\/p>\n<p>The Stanley Cup Final rematch will have to wait until Thursday, Feb. 9, when the Avalanche visit the Lightning.<\/p>\n<h2>Thanksgiving Eve and Season-Ending Chaos<\/h2>\n<p>Two of the NHL&#8217;s low-key greatest traditions will continue this season. On Wednesday, Nov. 23, the NHL has 15 games before going dark on (American) Thanksgiving. Only the Los Angeles Kings and Lightning aren&#8217;t in action the day before Turkey Day.<\/p>\n<p>Wednesday, Nov. 23 (all times Eastern)<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>St. Louis at Buffalo, 7 p.m.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Boston at Florida, 7 p.m.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Toronto at New Jersey, 7 p.m.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Calgary at Pittsburgh, 7 p.m.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Philadelphia at Washington, 7 p.m.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Arizona at Carolina, 7 p.m.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Montreal at Columbus, 7 p.m.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Winnipeg at Minnesota, 7 p.m.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Nashville at Detroit, 7:30 p.m.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Edmonton at N.Y.

The New York Islanders, for example, had to play 13 games on the road to start last season as UBS Arena was completed.<\/p>\n<p>While they aren&#8217;t starting the season with a long road trip, the Coyotes are barely home for the first two months of the season. After opening the season with six road games, they play four straight at Arizona State, including their home opener Oct. 28 against the Winnipeg Jets. Then the Coyotes are off for a 14-game road trip that will take them from the East Coast to Vegas to the mid-Atlantic back to the West Coast and then finishes with a swing through western Canada.<\/p>\n<p>Their next home game after a Nov. 3 contest against Dallas is Dec. 9 against Boston.<\/p>\n<p>The Coyotes tell ESPN that the road trip is by design. The annex building with the NHL-quality dressing rooms won&#8217;t be ready until December. The four home games in October will be played using temporary dressing rooms in order to &#8220;break up the schedule a bit for the players,&#8221; the team said.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, things do balance out. The Coyotes play 19 of their last 26 games of the season on campus.<\/p>\n<h2>The games you can&#8217;t miss<\/h2>\n<p>Jan. 16: Dallas at Vegas, 6 p.m. ET<br \/>It&#8217;s the Pete DeBoer Revenge Tour, as the fired Golden Knights coach leads his new team against a conference rival and his former players.<\/p>\n<p>Oct. 15: Los Angeles at Minnesota, 8 p.m. ET<br \/>The first game back in Minnesota for Kevin Fiala after he was traded to the Kings in the offseason.<\/p>\n<p>Dec. 5: Vegas at Boston, 7 p.m. ET<br \/>This game has two points of intrigue. The first is the return of former Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy to Boston as Vegas head coach. The second is the first game in Boston for Boston University alum Jack Eichel as a member of the Golden Knights.<\/p>\n<p>Nov. 15: New Jersey at Montreal, 7 p.m. ET<br \/>No matter who goes first and who goes second in the 2022 NHL draft, this would be the first scheduled meeting between those two rookies &#8212; provided they both play in the NHL next season. If they don&#8217;t &#8230; hey, Jack Hughes vs. Nick Suzuki is still on the card.<\/p>\n<p>March 1: Toronto at Edmonton, 8 p.m. ET<br \/>March 11: Edmonton at Toronto, 7 p.m. ET<br \/>Connor McDavid vs. Auston Matthews, twice in a 10-day span. McDavid, the NHL leader in points last season and runner-up for the Hart Trophy. Matthews, the leader in goals last season and the winner of the NHL&#8217;s MVP award. Two generational talents and always a must-see matchup for hockey fans.<\/p>\n<p>Oct. 15: Calgary at Edmonton, 10 p.m. ET<br \/>Oct. 29: Edmonton at Calgary, 10 p.m. ET<br \/>Dec. 27: Edmonton at Calgary, 9 p.m. ET<br \/>The Battle of Alberta. If you got a taste for the chaos during their epic playoff series, suffice it say their regular-season meetings are just as fun.<\/p>\n<p>Nov. 9: Pittsburgh at Washington, 7:30 p.m. ET<br \/>Jan. 26: Pittsburgh at Washington, 7 p.m. ET<br \/>March 25: Washington at Pittsburgh, 8 p.m. ET<br \/>We have a scant few years left of being able to  watch Sidney Crosby and Alex Ovechkin battle for their respective teams in this decades-old rivalry.
