That combination would be a tough challenge for anyone, let alone a 21-year-old looking to establish himself in the Premier League, and Sessegnon realised he needed help.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking in an exclusive interview with ESPN, Sessegnon is admirably candid about sourcing his own psychologist for sessions over Zoom after yet another fitness setback, a thigh problem that curtailed his progress on loan at Bundesliga club Hoffenheim during the 2020-21 season.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/soccer\/blog-transfer-talk\/story\/4640916\/\" \/>play<\/p>\n<p>1:35<\/p>\n<p>Ryan Sessegnon says Antonio Conte is a perfectionist who inspires his players to work to the best of their ability.<\/p>\n<p>16.15 BST: Granit Xhaka has said he was close to leaving Arsenal after he was booed off and clashed with his own supporters during a Premier League match against Crystal Palace in 2019.<\/p>\n<p>Arsenal were pegged back in a 2-2 draw against Palace at the Emirates Stadium and when Xhaka was substituted in the second half, he was met with jeers from Arsenal fans for taking time to come off the pitch. The midfielder then removed his shirt when storming off the pitch and appeared to swear at his own supporters, as well as waving his arms taunting fans to boo louder and cupping his ear.<\/p>\n<p>Xhaka was subsequently stripped of the club captaincy and has revealed he was ready to leave the north London club following the incident.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;My bags were packed. The passports were out,&#8221; he told the Players&#8217; Tribune. &#8220;I was done with Arsenal. Finished. There was a contract on the table from another club, and all I had to do was sign.

The change of coach [Ronald Koeman to Xavi Hernandez] has been very good for us. The players have a more hard-working mentality and you can see that in the results.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I am working hard and hope to be back with the team soon.

Conte has long been an admirer of the 21-year-old with sources telling ESPN he was keen on signing the winger during his Inter Milan tenure and the forward is said to have settled in quickly at the north London club.<\/p>\n<p>Spurs are already committed to making centre-back Cristian Romero&#8217;s loan move from Atalanta permanent at the end of the season for a fixed \u20ac55m fee and signing Kulusevski in addition would represent a significant outlay before pursuing fresh targets. But ESPN sources claim Spurs have a mandatory obligation to sign Kulusevski on a permanent deal in 2023 for a higher price if he plays in 50% of Tottenham&#8217;s Premier League games next season, which is almost certain assuming he stays clear of injury given his importance to the team, and Conte is keen to resolve any uncertainty over the player&#8217;s situation.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Sessegnon interview: Spurs career finally taking off under Conte<\/p>\n<p>11.18 BST: Real Madrid midfielder Luka Modric hinted that he is close to signing a new contract at the Bernabeu.<\/p>\n<p>Modric, 36, is out of contract in the summer, but he showed how he is still a key player for <i>Los Blancos<\/i> in the second leg of their Champions League quarterfinal against Chelsea on Tuesday. The Croatia captain&#8217;s sublime assist for Rodrygo sparked Madrid&#8217;s comeback from 3-0 down on the night to progress in 5-4 on aggregate after extra time.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking after the match, Modric said: &#8220;We&#8217;ll keep going year-by-year and see how long I feel well and keep playing at a high level.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Despite his age, Modric has made 37 appearances for Madrid already this season, registering nine assists and three goals, as well as scoring another three in six matches for his country.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Olley: Chelsea showed spirit in heart-breaking exit to Real Madrid<\/p>\n<p>10.31 BST: Sevilla are in the race to sign River Plate midfielder Enzo Fernandez, according to Ole.<\/p>\n<p>Fernandez, 21, was promoted to River&#8217;s first team in July 2021 and has impressed this year.

But despite making 34 appearances in all competitions for the Rio de Janeiro-based team, sources have told ESPN that Pereira has not done enough to convince Flamengo to complete a permanent move for the midfielder.<\/p>\n<p>Having signed for United as a 15-year-old in 2011 after leaving the youth ranks of PSV Eindhoven, Pereira has struggled to realise his potential in the first-team at Old Trafford. Loan moves to Spanish clubs Granada and Valencia, followed by another temporary move to Serie A with Lazio, have restricted Pereira to just 75 senior appearances for United.<\/p>\n<p>Sources have told ESPN that United are still hopeful that a deal can be done with Flamengo, who may yet be prepared to sign Pereira for a reduced fee.<\/p>\n<p>09.00 BST: Bayern Munich CEO Oliver Kahn has brushed aside reports that Robert Lewandowski could leave the club this summer.<\/p>\n<p>Recent reports claimed Lewandowski, who has one year left in his contract with Bayern, is considering an offer from Barcelona and could leave Bayern in the transfer window.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are not crazy,&#8221; Kahn said on Tuesday when asked about Lewandowski&#8217;s future. &#8220;We are talking about a player that scores between 30 and 40 goals for us each season.

As quoted by the Sun, the Page explained if Bale has a World Cup to prepare for, he&#8217;ll find a new club, as its the only tournament missing from his CV. Bale, who was on the bench for Madrid&#8217;s Champions League tie against Chelsea on Tuesday, was booed by the Madrid faithful last weekend, and looks set to end his stay in the Spanish capital this summer. Wales are set to face Scotland or Ukraine this summer in the playoff final for the chance to seal a place in Qatar.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Barcelona are considering a move for VfB Stuttgart left-back Borna Sosa, according to Sport. The Catalan giants want competition for places behind Jordi Alba, and the 24-year-old, who has played 23 games for Stuttgart could fit the bill. Sosa&#8217;s Stuttgart contract ends in 2025 but the Croatian has a \u20ac25m release clause if the side are relegated.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; AC Milan are exploring new options ahead of the 2022-23 season and they have their eye on a sensational cross-city swoop for Ivan Perisic, according to Rudy Galetti. The 33-year-old&#8217;s contract expires next June and Internazionale are yet to extend the Croatian&#8217;s existing deal. This uncertainty has prompted Milan&#8217;s representatives to make contact with Perisic&#8217;s entourage in the hope of strengthening their wide options, and stealing a player from their nearest rivals.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Vasco da Gama star Andrey Santos is attracting interest from across Europe, with Wolverhampton Wanderers and Barcelona among the clubs trying to sign the highly-rated midfielder. The 17-year-old&#8217;s contract is due to expire in August 2023 and despite making only three appearances this season for the Rio de Janeiro side, Globo Esporte reports that Santos could be heading to Europe. AC Milan, AS Monaco and Benfica are also interested, although Vasco are also keen to hang on to their man and offer the Brazilian U20 international a longer deal.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Arsenal defender Gabriel Magalhaes is on Barcelona&#8217;s radar.\u00a0David Price\/Arsenal FC via Getty ImagesThe summer transfer window is approaching, and there&#8217;s plenty of gossip swirling about who&#8217;s moving where.
