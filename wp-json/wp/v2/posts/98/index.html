Her mom, Tonya, boasts a TikTok account of her daughter\u2019s original designs, @middle.mom, with 582.9K followers and 22.6M likes. Among those fans? Famous adult fashion icons, including Vera Wang, who sent the young talent a handwritten note. <\/p>\n<p>Wang commented on one of Tonya\u2019s TikTok videos and later sent Kaia a handwritten note, along with a purple backpack. \u201cSo excited to see you are already pursuing your dream of becoming a fashion designer! Congratulations and all good luck,\u201d Wang signed the note.<\/p>\n<p>Kaia told The Post she\u2019s been designing \u201cfor a while now,\u201d and just started sewing in November 2021. Her first project was a cat bed. But she quickly escalated to completing her own outfits.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI like that depending on what you\u2019re wearing it can make you feel confident and brave,\u201d the youngster from Colorado told The Post. <\/p>\n<p>        <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"660\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/gunnard-eatherage1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=660\" alt=\"\" \/>Kaia is known for her creative vision and quick turnaround time when bringing her unique designs to life which have captured the attention of major fashion stars, including Vera Wang and Gunnar Deatherage.     <\/p>\n<p>Kaia\u2019s career began last Christmas when she was gifted a dress form. Right away, she grabbed a piece of scrap fabric, went into her room and pinned it to the form, sewed it together and walked out in her own design about an hour later. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt kind of blew me away,\u201d Kaia\u2019s mom Tonya said. \u201cI thought the dress form was for decoration. I didn\u2019t realize she was actually going to use it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But the talent didn\u2019t come from nowhere. Tonya said her daughter has always had a knack for style.  <\/p>\n<p>\u201cSince she was young enough to pick out her own clothes she was always very meticulous about the items she would pick,\u201d the proud mom said. \u201cShe would always go over the top with accessories and she would mix and match things that didn\u2019t make sense to me but would make sense after she put it on.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>        <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"704\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/child1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=704\" alt=\"\" \/>The young fashion talent is recognized for her ability to mix and match fabrics and accessories that others wouldn\u2019t dare to make her creations come to life.     <\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnd she did not get that from me,\u201d Tonya said, eliciting giggles from Kaia. \u201cThat is all unique to Kaia.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Kaia still creates most of her designs alone, but she has a large team supporting and working with her: The Aragon family has fostered 14 children and still remain \u201cvery, very close\u201d with 10 of them. \u201cI count all 10 of them as biological,\u201d Kaia made sure to clarify. <\/p>\n<p>She has dreams of starting her own fashion company with her siblings and friends. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy friends and my big sister would be the designers because that\u2019s what we wanna do and then my brother said he would do hair for our business,\u201d she explained. <\/p>\n<p>The requests have already come pouring in from friends asking for outfits and strangers putting in orders for wedding and prom dresses. But for now, Kaia still prefers to design for herself. <\/p>\n<p>While Tonya loves to see her daughter\u2019s skills grow, she doesn\u2019t want to lock her daughter into the fashion business anytime soon, she said.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@middle.mom\/video\/7052710663516491054\"><p>  @middle.mom <\/p>\n<p>We are learning as we go here. She asked for a mannequin and I had no idea she would use it the way she has. We will keep learning and growing. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\ufe0f<\/p>\n<p>  Superstar \u2013 Beatrich  <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>      <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/vera-wang-note1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"\" \/>Kaia has accepted challenges from friends and fans, always surprising them with her original creative vision.     <\/p>\n<p>\u201cShe does this because it makes her happy, and the minute you turn it into a business it\u2019s something she has to do. She\u2019s only 9, she\u2019s in third grade, she should absolutely have the opportunity to change her mind if this isn\u2019t something she wants to do forever.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s at the point in her life where she should explore a million other things that she enjoys,\u201d she added.<\/p>\n<p>And while she\u2019s been receiving a lot of encouragement, Kaia isn\u2019t letting it get to her head. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cRight now I\u2019m just doing this for fun,\u201d the little fashionista said. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Fashion may have its newest star, but the world will have to wait a few years until Kaia Aragon finishes school \u2014 elementary school, that is.
