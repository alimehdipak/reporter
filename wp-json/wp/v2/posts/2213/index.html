A balcony that runs along the full length of the rear of the property also overlooks that green space.

The eat-in kitchen comes newly renovated, the listing notes, and Versace-inspired furnishings are also available for purchase.<\/p>\n<p>The mansion had previously been on the market, but for rent, according to the Journal. It once asked a cool $100,000 per month. One renter, city developer Joe Chetrit, sued Thomas Sandell, and alleged there were maintenance issues with the home. But Field told the Journal the case was \u201camicably resolved.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Sandells have another property now on the market: an approximately 10-acre piece of land on Meadow Lane in Southampton that asks $75 million.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s a fashionable get.
