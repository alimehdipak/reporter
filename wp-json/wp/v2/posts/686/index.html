I don&#8217;t read about it, I don&#8217;t hear it too much. &#8230; None of that stuff matters to me, I&#8217;m having a blast playing the game of basketball.&#8221;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/photo\/2022\/0210\/r972475_1296x1296_1-1.jpg&amp;w=130&amp;h=130&amp;scale=crop&amp;location=center\" width=\"65\" height=\"65\" \/><\/li>\n<li><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/photo\/2022\/0320\/official_nba_power_rankings_1296x1296.jpg&amp;w=130&amp;h=130&amp;scale=crop&amp;location=center\" width=\"65\" height=\"65\" \/><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>1 Related<\/p>\n<p>Lakers coach Frank Vogel said that James&#8217; play &#8212; he averaged 37.3 points on 57.1% shooting, 10 rebounds and 8.3 assists to end the trip as L.A. beat two playoff teams in Toronto and Cleveland and narrowly lost to Washington after leading by as many as 16 &#8212; has kept his group competitive despite how the season has gone.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is a league that when things don&#8217;t go the right way, it&#8217;s not a pleasant thing to be around,&#8221; Vogel said. &#8220;This team has not let go of the rope and the biggest, No. 1 reason is because of how he&#8217;s played and how he&#8217;s led and what he represents in terms of having confidence about where we can ultimately get to.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>James got to relish in the glory days a bit on Monday. He racked up his third career triple-double against the team that drafted him and received a lengthy, rousing ovation from the Cleveland crowd when the videoboard acknowledged him passing Karl Malone to become the NBA&#8217;s No. 2 all-time scorer over the weekend. And he gave a special welcome to his old teammate, Kevin Love.<\/p>\n<p>He dunked on him.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;To be completely honest, I hated that it had to be him,&#8221; James said with a smile. &#8220;He&#8217;s my guy. That&#8217;s my brother. And I hope I&#8217;m still invited to [Love&#8217;s] wedding. That&#8217;s not even in my all-time dunks so I&#8217;ll take it out. I didn&#8217;t mean it. K-Love, I love you and I take it back. I wish I could take those two points back and we still win the game by nine.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>L.A. had that cushion thanks to not only James, but Russell Westbrook (20 points, 11 assists) and D.J. Augustin (20 points on 7-for-7 shooting).<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Internally, we feel like we&#8217;re a great team and we can do something special,&#8221; Augustin said. &#8220;Make a run. Get into the playoffs. And make a run in the playoffs. And as long as we believe in each other, it doesn&#8217;t matter what anybody else thinks.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Westbrook said he is motivated to prove the doubters wrong who have commented on the Lakers&#8217; woes all season long.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Nothing better than shutting people up,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>The Lakers might have quieted the noise for a night, but still have six of their final 10 games on the road and the home games aren&#8217;t gimmes either, with the Philadelphia 76ers and the Denver Nuggets coming to town.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to play with a lot of passion, a lot of energy, give my teammates what they deserve, what they need and like I said for the rest of the season hopefully I can stay somewhat injury-free,&#8221; James said. &#8220;Obviously, I&#8217;m dealing with a few injuries right now, but I&#8217;m working through it and we&#8217;re working through it and that&#8217;s all that matters. We leave everything on the floor and control what you can control and what you can&#8217;t you don&#8217;t worry about. Just my mindset.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>CLEVELAND &#8212; With the Los Angeles Lakers&#8217; flat-lining season experiencing a bit of a blip with Monday&#8217;s 131-120 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers, LeBron James says he still has something left to play for.&#8221;I&#8217;m literally having the time of my life right now,&#8221; James said after the Lakers finished their four-game road trip by winning&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":687,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[13],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/686"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=686"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/686\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/687"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=686"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=686"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=686"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
