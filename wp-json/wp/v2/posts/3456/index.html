Pham had said the dispute stemmed from an old text sent by Pederson to the league&#8217;s group chat in which he disrespected his teammates on the San Diego Padres, for whom he played last season.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking Tuesday in Boston, Pham said he is over whatever happened.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s something you really just put behind you,&#8221; Pham told reporters, according to The Cincinnati Enquirer. &#8220;Everyone in that group chat, everybody knows. I&#8217;ve had some of those guys reach out to me. They already know what&#8217;s up.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Pham also contested Pederson&#8217;s assertion that the IR move was legal.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We had rules to the IR,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I know the ESPN app rules. We had our own individual rules.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Pham said one person could have prevented it all &#8212; their fantasy league&#8217;s commissioner, Los Angeles Angels star Mike Trout.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Trout did a terrible job, man,&#8221; Pham said, laughing, per the Enquirer. &#8220;Trout is the worst commissioner in fantasy sports because he allowed a lot of (stuff) to go on, and he could&#8217;ve solved it all. I don&#8217;t want to be the [expletive] commissioner; I&#8217;ve got other (stuff) to do. (Trout) didn&#8217;t want to do it. We put it on him, so it&#8217;s kind of our fault too because we made him commissioner.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tommy Pham wasn&#8217;t quite ready to return to the Cincinnati Reds lineup Tuesday night, even though his much-publicized three-game suspension had ended.The veteran outfielder felt some tightness in his calf during batting practice before the team&#8217;s series opener against the Boston Red Sox.
