What we know about Elon\u2019s dad\"><\/p>\n<p>Move over, Elon \u2014 there\u2019s another Musk hitting the headlines. <\/p>\n<p>Errol Musk, the family\u2019s patriarch, is in the news after confirming he fathered a second secret love child with his stepdaughter, Jana Bezuidenhout, 35. <\/p>\n<p>The 76-year-old is most notable for being Elon\u2019s estranged father, with the pair famously falling out several years ago. Elon, 51, was brought to tears discussing his dad in a 2017 interview with Rolling Stone, describing him as \u201cevil\u201d and \u201ca terrible human being.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But little else is known about Errol outside of his native South Africa, where he has made a name for himself as a high-powered engineer, property developer and political advocate who vehemently opposed apartheid. <\/p>\n<p>Like his son, the wealthy business owner \u2014 who was once rumored to be the co-owner of a Zambian emerald mine \u2014 has also been mired in controversy. <\/p>\n<p>Several decades ago, Errol allegedly shot and killed three armed intruders who broke into his Johannesburg home. By some accounts, Elon is reported to have witnessed the attack, with Errol later telling Rolling Stone that he acted in self-defense; he was never convicted of any crime.  <\/p>\n<p>Here is the incredible true story of Errol Musk \u2014 and the striking similarities he shares with his powerful son. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/elon-errol-musk-99.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Errol Musk, Elon Musk's estranged father, is making headlines after he confirmed he has fathered a second love child with his stepdaughter. \" \/>Errol Musk (left), Elon Musk\u2019s estranged father, is making headlines after he confirmed he fathered a second love child with his stepdaughter. Both: Getty Images    <\/p>\n<h2>A family of innovators and adventurers<\/h2>\n<p>Given Elon Musk\u2019s interest in exploration and adventure, it\u2019s no surprise he descends from intrepid stock, and it\u2019s Errol\u2019s side of the family that is seemingly responsible for his innovative, envelope-pushing genes. <\/p>\n<p>Errol\u2019s grandmother was Canada\u2019s first chiropractor, while Errol\u2019s own mom and dad were the first two people to fly from South Africa to Australia in a single-engine airplane, according to Forbes magazine.<\/p>\n<p>Errol himself has an adventurous streak and is an avid sailor and pilot. He began his career as an electromechanical engineer. <\/p>\n<p>In 1970, Errol married model\u00a0Maye Haldeman Musk before the pair welcomed three children: Elon, Kimbal and Tosca.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Elon has himself admitted that his father has a very high IQ and is \u201cbrilliant at engineering.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>As a child, Elon had a close relationship with his father and grew up prosperous in Pretoria. Errol was elected to the Pretoria City Council in 1972 and was an outspoken advocate for abolishing apartheid. His children were reportedly influenced by his liberal political views. <\/p>\n<p>When Errol and Maye divorced in 1979, a then-8-year-old Elon chose to live with his dad. <\/p>\n<p>According to Ashlee Vance\u2019s 2017 biography of the Tesla founder, \u201cThe Musk family owned one of the biggest houses in Pretoria thanks to the success of Errol\u2019s engineering business,\u201d which included \u201clarge projects such as office buildings, retail complexes, residential subdivisions, and an air force base.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Daily Mail has reported that Errol was a multimillionaire before the age of 30. <\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Elon has himself admitted that his father has a very high IQ and is \u201cbrilliant at engineering.\u201d In 2017, he also told Rolling Stone that Errol was \u201cthe youngest person to get a professional engineer\u2019s qualification in South Africa.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m naturally good at engineering \u2014 that\u2019s because I inherited it from my father,\u201d the world\u2019s richest man stated. \u201cWhat\u2019s very difficult for others is easy for me. For a while, I thought things were so obvious that everyone must know this.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>However, Elon has disputed claims that he grew up with a silver spoon in his mouth. He has also dismissed rumors that his father co-owned a Zambian emerald mine, writing on Twitter in 2019: \u201cHe didn\u2019t own an emerald mine &amp; I worked my way through college, ending up ~$100k in student debt. I couldn\u2019t even afford a 2nd PC at Zip2, so programmed at night &amp; website only worked during day.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/errol-musk-backstory-07.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Errol Musk comes from a long line of adventurers, and was a successful engineer, property developer and political advocate. \" \/>Errol Musk comes from a long line of adventurers and was a successful engineer, property developer and political advocate. AFP via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<h2>A violent act<\/h2>\n<p>On an undisclosed date, Errol reportedly shot and killed three of up to a half-dozen armed intruders who broke into his Johannesburg home, according to Rolling Stone. <\/p>\n<p>The patriarch confirmed the shootings to the publication in 2017, saying manslaughter charges were later dropped because he acted in self-defense. <\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s unclear how old Elon was at the time \u2014 and whether he was even present is in dispute.<\/p>\n<p>However, in the recent Channel 4 documentary \u201cElon Musk: Superhero or Supervillain,\u201d co-founder of SpaceX, Jim Cattrell, claimed Elon was home at the time. In an interview with Express, Cattrell recalled: \u201cOne night, they were sitting in the living room and his dad said \u2018Everybody down! Get down!&#8217;\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He continued: \u201cHe grabbed some weapons, as you could see on the cameras there were some intruders that were coming over the walls, and they were also armed. There was a shooting in the living room, and I guess his father shot them dead.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cElon was a witness to this, bullets flying around,\u201d Cattrell further claimed. \u201cSo it was very formative for him. You could tell by the way that he told the story. He had this sense that it was definitely not a safe place to be, and he had to get the hell out.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/errol-musk-backstory-08.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Errol confirmed he was embroiled in a shooting, but says he acted in self-defense.

AFP via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<h2>A falling out<\/h2>\n<p>At some point after the shooting, the relationship between dad Errol and son Elon soured. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe was such a terrible human being. You have no idea. My dad will have a carefully thought-out plan of evil. He will plan evil,\u201d Elon tearfully told Rolling Stone in 2017.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAlmost every crime you can possibly think of, he has done,\u201d he continued. \u201cAlmost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cHe was such a terrible human being. You have no idea.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Elon clarified that his father was never physically abusive toward him and that he once tried to mend the relationship by inviting his father to live with him in the United States. <\/p>\n<p>However, any reconciliation was apparently short-lived. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn my experience, there is nothing you can do,\u201d Elon said of Errol. \u201cNothing, nothing. I wish. I\u2019ve tried everything. I tried threats, rewards, intellectual arguments, emotional arguments, everything to try to change my father for the better, and he \u2026 no way, it just got worse.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Errol subsequently told the publication in an email: \u201cI\u2019ve been accused of being a Gay, a Misogynist, a Paedophile, a Traitor, a Rat, a S\u2013t (quite often), a Bastard (by many women whose attentions I did not return) and much more. My own (wonderful) mother told me I am \u2018ruthless\u2019 and should learn to be more \u2018humane.\u2019 But I love my children and would readily do whatever for them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/elon-musk-1-4.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Elon Musk\" \/>Elon has publicly slammed his father, saying: \u201cAlmost every crime you can possibly think of, he has done. Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done.\u201dGetty Images    <\/p>\n<h2>Seven children<\/h2>\n<p>Errol and Elon\u2019s feud has reportedly been exacerbated by the patriarch\u2019s eyebrow-raising relationships. <\/p>\n<p>After his divorce from Elon\u2019s mother, Errol went on to wed Heide\u00a0Bezuidenhout, a young widow who already had two children, including 4-year-old Jana Bezuidenhout.<\/p>\n<p>Errol and Heide had two children of their own, but he also helped raise Jana. Errol and Heide eventually divorced after an 18-year marriage.<\/p>\n<p>    <img src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/elon-musk-father-step-daughter-child-07.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Jana is pictured with her and Errol's oldest child, son Elliot Rush.

Jana and the boy, Elliot, are pictured.     <\/p>\n<p>In 2017, family members were left stunned when Jana became pregnant with Errol\u2019s baby. Elon was said to be particularly furious that his father had impregnated his stepsister.<\/p>\n<p>Errol\u2019s other children we also \u201cshocked\u201d and uncomfortable about the surprise pregnancy.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThey still don\u2019t like it. They still feel a bit creepy about it.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThey still don\u2019t like it,\u201d Errol admitted in a new interview with\u00a0the Sun: \u201cThey still feel a bit creepy about it because she\u2019s their sister. Their half-sister.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The child, a boy named Elliot Rush, is now 5 years old. On Wednesday, Errol confirmed that he and Jana had welcomed a second child, a daughter who is now 3. <\/p>\n<p>The 76-year-old hasn\u2019t ruled out having more children, saying: \u201cThe only thing we are on Earth for is to reproduce.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In that way, Errol might be like estranged Elon after all. <\/p>\n<p>The Tesla CEO has fathered 10 children.
