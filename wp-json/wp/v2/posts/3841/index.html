The term cul-de-sac is used specifically to refer to the rectouterine pouch (the pouch of Douglas), an extension of the peritoneal cavity between the rectum and back wall of the uterus.<\/p>\n<p>The cul de sac is also known as the pouch of Douglas and is located between the uterus and the rectum. This area can fill with fluid released from the dominant follicle after it ruptures and ovulation occurs.<\/p>\n<p>The rectouterine pouch (TA: excavatio rectouterina 3), also known as the rectovaginal pouch, cul-de-sac or pouch of Douglas, is an extension of peritoneum between the posterior wall of uterus and the rectum in females.<\/p>\n<p>(3) The intermediate part forming the bottom of the conjunctival sac, unattached to the eyelids or the eyeball and joining the bulbar and the palpebral portion is called the fornix (conjunctival fold, cul-de-sac).<\/p>\n<p>Definition of cul-de-sac<\/p>\n<p>1 : a blind diverticulum or pouch. 2 : a street or passage closed at one end Our house is located on a quiet cul-de-sac. 3 : blind alley If your job is a cul-de-sac, you have to quit or accept the fact that your career is over.\u2014 Seth Godin.<\/p>\n<p>The expression cul-de-sac comes from French, where it originally meant \u201cbottom of a sack\u201d. It was first used in English in anatomy (since 1738). It was used for dead-end streets since 1800 in English (since the 14th century in French).<\/p>\n<p>The cul-de-sac is formed by the peritoneal reflection anterior and posterior to the uterus. A small amount of anechoic fluid in the cul-de-sac is physiologic. Echogenic fluid in the cul-de-sac is highly suggestive of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the association with pelvic pathologies, free fluid in the cul-de-sac may aid certain reproductive processes. The fluid may act as an intermediary between the ovaries while affecting fertilization, implantation and embryo development through either direct or indirect hormonal, biochemical and cellular agents.<\/p>\n<p>The posterior cul-de-sac, i.e., the space between the uterus and rectum. The anterior cul-de-sac, i.e., the space between the uterus and bladder. The outer surface of the uterus. The lining of the pelvic cavity.<\/p>\n<p>On either side of the uterus sit two small pouches. These are called the cul-de-sacs. The anterior cul-de-sac is the space between the bladder and the uterus. The posterior cul-de-sac is between the uterus and the rectum.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022cul de sac (noun)<\/p>\n<p>blind alley, dead end, dead-end, impasse.<\/p>\n<p>The peritoneum is comprised of 2 layers: the superficial parietal layer and the deep visceral layer. The peritoneal cavity contains the omentum, ligaments, and mesentery. Intraperitoneal organs include the stomach, spleen, liver, first and fourth parts of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, transverse, and sigmoid colon.<\/p>\n<p>Use eye drops correctly<\/p>\n<p>Tilt your head back and look up. With 1 hand, pull your lower eyelid down and away from your eyeball \u2014 this makes a \u201cpocket\u201d for the drops. With the other hand, hold the eye drop bottle upside down with the tip just above the pocket. Squeeze the prescribed number of eye drops into the pocket.<\/p>\n<p>The chambers in front of the lens (both the anterior and posterior chambers) are filled with a clear, watery fluid called aqueous humour.<\/p>\n<p>Retina. What is it? Your retina is a light-sensitive layer that coats the inner part of your eye.<\/p>\n<p>The female pelvis is a complex and ever-changing area of the human body, and the pouch of Douglas is a particular area of contrasts. Also known as the cul-de-sac, the pouch of Douglas exists between the uterus and the rectum, and it is the most dependent area of the pelvis, where fluids pool.<\/p>\n<p>noun. butt [noun] (slang) a person\u2019s bottom.<\/p>\n<p>What are cul-de-sacs? Elegantly derived from the French for \u201cbottom of a bag,\u201d a cul-de-sac is essentially any street that leads to a dead end with only one way in and out.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cul-de-sac: In anatomy, a blind pouch or cavity that is closed at one end.
