Since the sacking of Sean Dyche on April 16, Jackson has led Burnley to three wins and a draw from his four games in charge &#8212; not bad for a man whose previous experience as a manager came at Shrewsbury and Tranmere. Not only has Burnley&#8217;s form given them a chance of avoiding relegation, but it&#8217;s also given Jackson a chance of landing the top job permanently.<\/p>\n<p>Vincent Kompany and Wayne Rooney are among the names being mentioned to take over in the summer, but if Jackson can keep Burnley in the Premier League with a thrilling great escape, why would they want to change?<\/p>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p>In only a short space of time, he&#8217;s got the squad playing for him while also reigniting their belief. Against Watford on Saturday they were behind until the 83rd minute before two goals in three minutes secured a fantastic comeback. Jackson might not be a big name, but he&#8217;s already achieved big things. <em>&#8212; Dawson<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/i\/teamlogos\/soccer\/500\/86.png\" width=\"50\" \/>Real Madrid clinch LaLiga<\/p>\n<p>It was party time in the Spanish capital on Saturday as Real Madrid beat Espanyol 4-0 to wrap up their 35th LaLiga title with four games to spare. Many will point to the lack of competition at the top end of the table &#8212; Barcelona and Atletico Madrid have been irregular, while Sevilla&#8217;s challenge fizzled out down the stretch &#8212; but credit must also go to Carlo Ancelotti and his players for their remarkable consistency. They have lost just three times in breezing to a second title in three years, wrestling the trophy back from Atletico.<\/p>\n<p><b>&#8211; Hunter: How Real Madrid fought for their 35th LaLiga crown<br \/>&#8211; Ancelotti becomes first manager to win big five European leagues<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The image of the weekend, as the players headed to celebrate with their fans at Cibeles, came from Ancelotti, who in winning the Spanish league became the first coach to win the five big European leagues following success in Italy, England, Germany and France. He was photographed with a Madrid scarf, sunglasses and a cigar, surrounded by players. &#8220;The BOSS,&#8221; wrote Vinicius Junior.<\/p>\n<p>On Vinicius: here&#8217;s a quick shout-out for the Brazilian after a season in which he&#8217;s emerged as one of the best youngsters in the game, but this title will probably be remembered for the impact of Karim Benzema. The Frenchman, who scored against Espanyol, has 26 goals this season, 11 more than anyone else in the league, and has become the symbol of this title-winning Madrid side. <em>&#8212; Marsden<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/soccer\/blog-espn-fc-united\/story\/4655240\/\" \/>play<\/p>\n<p>1:30<\/p>\n<p>Ale Moreno and Luis Garcia hail Real Madrid&#8217;s consistency as they secured their 35th LaLiga title with a 4-0 win vs. Espanyol.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/soccer\/500-dark\/176.png&amp;w=126&amp;site=espnfc\" width=\"50\" \/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/soccer\/500-dark\/167.png&amp;w=126&amp;site=espnfc\" width=\"50\" \/><b>Marseille win remind Lyon what might have been for them<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Sunday&#8217;s clash sums it up so well. Lyon are seventh in Ligue 1, 10 points behind second-place Marseille, and yet it was OL who walked away convincing and comprehensive winners on Sunday.<\/p>\n<p>Lyon have struggled all season with consistency, having one good game, two bad ones and the same again and again. Sunday was further proof: two weeks after a humiliating 2-1 loss at Brest, they were capable of putting up a performance like this in the hostile Velodrome atmosphere: solid defensively, inspired at times offensively and with their young prospects Castello Lukeba and Malo Gusto carrying them. Manager Peter Bosz was smart in his choices (Bradley Barcola starting on the right, Thiago Mendes and Houssem Aouar in midfield), a phrase that we haven&#8217;t said much this season considering some of his shocking decisions at other points during a tough season.<\/p>\n<p>As always, though, the two Olympiques, Marseille and Lyon, offered a great spectacle and Lyon continued their superb run against their rivals, with only one loss in their last 14 encounters. However, what will happen next weekend away at bottom of the table Metz? Which version of Lyon will we see then? <em>&#8212; Laurens<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/soccer\/500-dark\/103.png&amp;w=126&amp;site=espnfc\" width=\"50\" \/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/soccer\/500-dark\/110.png&amp;w=126&amp;site=espnfc\" width=\"50\" \/>Serie A is Milan&#8217;s to lose, but Inter are still right there<\/p>\n<p>The 2021-22 Italian season has three rounds of games left, and it&#8217;s still too close to call at the very top as both sides of Milan won this weekend to keep it neatly poised.<\/p>\n<p>Milan left it late to beat Fiorentina 1-0, needing a goalkeeper gaffe for Rafael Leao to break the deadlock in the 82nd minute and clinch the three points that seemed destined to elude them. (With an xG of 1.56 on 13 shots, just three of which truly threatened, it had all the makings of &#8220;one of those days&#8221; until Pietro Terracciano misplayed a pass and let Leao atone for an earlier miss.)<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Inter strode to a 2-0 lead on the road at Udinese with first-half goals from Ivan Perisic and Lautaro Martinez, but had to hang on in the final 15-20 minutes after Ignacio Pussetto cut the lead to one and caused some nervy moments.<\/p>\n<p><b>&#8211; ESPN+ viewers&#8217; guide: LaLiga, Bundesliga, MLS, FA Cup, more<\/b><br \/><b>&#8211; Stream ESPN FC Daily on ESPN+ (U.S. only)<\/b><br \/><b>&#8211; Don&#8217;t have ESPN?

And Saturday&#8217;s felt like the most Dortmund collapse of all: after falling 2-0 down at home to Bochum inside the opening eight minutes (classic!), an Erling Haaland hat-trick (so Dortmund) including two penalties had them leading by the hour mark. Case closed, right?<\/p>\n<p>Then came a little bit of magic from Jurgen Locadia in the 81st minute to make it 3-3 and, well, you know where it goes from there. (Mark &#8220;85th minute penalty for the visitors&#8221; on your bingo card.) But the joy was Locadia&#8217;s finish to tie the game: taking advantage of some gentle defending by Manuel Akanji, the Dutch forward calmly cushioned Milos Pantovic&#8217;s outswinging cross on his instep, swiveled off Kanji&#8217;s hip and thundered it low beyond a helpless Marwin Hitz. It was a slick finish that silenced the Dortmund fans and set the stage for the remarkable comeback win.  <i>&#8212; Tyler<\/i><\/p>\n<h2>Two teams that should be worried<\/h2>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/soccer\/500-dark\/1068.png&amp;w=126&amp;site=espnfc\" width=\"50\" \/>Atletico Madrid<\/p>\n<p>Atletico Madrid won the title last season, but they are looking over their shoulders this year. Saturday&#8217;s defeat to Athletic Club leaves them fourth in the table heading into next weekend&#8217;s Madrid derby. By the time they play Real Madrid, they could have even fallen to fifth because Real Betis play twice before then.<\/p>\n<p>Diego Simeone&#8217;s side don&#8217;t have the most appealing run-in, either. Madrid may have already won the league, but they will take great glee in denting their rival&#8217;s hopes of qualifying for the Champions League. Atletico then travel to Elche before finishing the season against Sevilla and Real Sociedad, two sides competing with them for a top-four position. <em>&#8212; Marsden<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/soccer\/500-dark\/159.png&amp;w=126&amp;site=espnfc\" width=\"50\" \/><b>Bordeaux teetering<\/b><\/p>\n<p>After their 1-0 home defeat against Nice on Sunday, Bordeaux have now conceded 85 goals in the league this season! 85! In 35 matches in Ligue 1, that averages out to 2.42 goals per game. That is mind-blowing!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s by far the worst defense in Europe&#8217;s big five leagues. It is 15 goals more than the second worst one in France (Saint-Etienne). They have now won only one of their last 13 league matches. They are second from bottom, yet only four points behind Saint-Etienne in the relegation playoff position with three games to go.<\/p>\n<p>So it is not all over for them but they are so bad defensively (and offensively too to be fair) that they still need a miracle to stay up. They have changed manager (Vladimir Petkovic out, David Guion in), have expelled some players (Laurent Koscielny), have recruited new ones (Josuha Guilavogui, Marcelo) but it is still not working. We thought Bordeaux, six-time French champions (the last time in 2010) were too big to go down.

One shot hit him square in the face, but style doesn&#8217;t really come into it doesn&#8217;t matter when you&#8217;re battling relegation. There was also a remarkable double-save when Mason Mount&#8217;s shot squirmed onto the post, bounced across goal and Pickford recovered to appear at the other post and repel Cesar Azpilicueta&#8217;s thundering low effort. Then, from the ensuing corner, Pickford denied Antonio Rudiger&#8217;s close-range shot at the back post.<\/p>\n<p>Everton are still in the bottom three, but have a game in hand over Leeds United and Burnley, meaning Frank Lampard&#8217;s side have got five games to save themselves.
