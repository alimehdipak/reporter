According to the DA&#8217;s release, the case &#8220;includes an allegation of causing great bodily injury on the domestic violence victim.&#8221; The DA&#8217;s release noted that the children were present for the alleged assault but did not otherwise specify what the child abuse counts stemmed from.<\/p>\n<p>Bridges is scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Domestic violence creates physical, mental and emotional trauma that has a lasting impact on survivors,&#8221; Gascon said. &#8220;Children who witness family violence are especially vulnerable and the impact on them is immeasurable.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Bridges was arrested June 29 by Los Angeles police and was later released on $130,000 bond.<\/p>\n<p>The Hornets and the NBA both said they were aware of the charges filed against Bridges, with the league noting it is investigating the allegations.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;These are very serious charges that we will continue to monitor,&#8221; the Hornets said. &#8220;As this is a legal matter, we will have no further comment at this time.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Bridges&#8217; agent, Rich Paul, could not immediately be reached by The Associated Press for comment on Tuesday night.<\/p>\n<p>Mychelle Johnson, the mother of Bridges&#8217; two young children, posted several pictures on Instagram on July 1 of what appeared to be injuries and a medical report that read &#8220;adult victim of physical abuse by male partner; Assault by strangulation, Brain concussion; Closed fracture of nasal bone; Contusion of rib; Multiple bruises; Strain of neck muscle.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>She did not mention Bridges by name but wrote on Instagram: &#8220;I hate that it has come to this but I can&#8217;t be silent anymore. I&#8217;ve allowed someone to destroy my home, abuse me in every way possible and traumatize our kids for life. I have nothing to prove to the world, but I won&#8217;t allow anyone who could do something so horrible to have no remorse and paint a picture of something I&#8217;m not. I won&#8217;t allow the people around him to continue to silence me and continue to lie to protect this person.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The LAPD said at the time of Bridges&#8217; arrest that it does not release police reports on domestic violence arrests. The case remains under investigation by the West Los Angeles branch of the LAPD.<\/p>\n<p>The 6-foot-7, 225-pound Bridges was the Hornets&#8217; leading scorer last season, his fourth in the NBA. The Hornets had extended Bridges a qualifying offer prior to his arrest, which allows them a chance to match any offer sheet made by another team.<\/p>\n<p><em>The Associated Press contributed to this report. <\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>LOS ANGELES &#8212; Charlotte Hornets restricted free agent Miles Bridges is facing three felony domestic violence charges after being accused of assaulting his girlfriend in front of their two children last month, the Los Angeles County district attorney said Tuesday.District Attorney George Gascon said his office filed one felony count of injuring a child&#8217;s parent&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":4619,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[13],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4618"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4618"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4618\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4618"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4618"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4618"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
