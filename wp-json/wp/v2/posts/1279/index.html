volcanic activity on the planet.<\/p>\n<p>They say this movement of hot magma is triggering marsquakes, which are similar to earthquakes, in a specific region of the Red Planet.<\/p>\n<p>If true, the finding would lend credence to theories that life may exist in underground caverns on Mars.<\/p>\n<p>Warm magma beneath the surface and groundwater thought to be present there could provide a habitat for alien microbes.<\/p>\n<p>Researchers at the Australian National University made their finding after combing through data from Nasa\u2019s InSight Mars lander.<\/p>\n<p>The car-sized robot has resided on the planet since 2018 and, among other things, takes readings of marsquakes.<\/p>\n<p>Little is understood about the subterranean vibrations and scientists hope to use InSight data to get a better idea of Mars\u2019 interior.<\/p>\n<p>The new research, published in\u00a0Nature Communications, uncovers 47 previously undetected marsquakes beneath the Martian crust.<\/p>\n<p>    <img

old.<\/p>\n<p>The study authors speculate that volcanic activity in the inner layers of the planet is the cause of the newly detected quakes.<\/p>\n<p>If true, the findings suggest magma in the Martian mantle is still active.<\/p>\n<p>Previously, scientists have argued that \u2013 similar to those on Earth \u2013 the quakes are the result of powerful Martian tectonic forces.<\/p>\n<p>The repetitive nature of these quakes and the fact they were all detected in the same area suggest that Mars is more seismically active than scientists previously thought.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe found that these marsquakes repeatedly occurred at all times of the Martian day,\u201d said ANU scientist and study co-author Professor Hrvoje Tkal\u010di\u0107.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhereas marsquakes detected and reported by NASA in the past appeared to have occurred only during the dead of night when the planet is quieter.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTherefore, we can assume that the movement of molten rock in the Martian mantle is the trigger for these 47 newly detected marsquakes beneath the Cerberus Fossae region.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He added that the conclusion is that Mars is still volcanicly active, contrary to the belief of some scientists.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/mars-81.jpg?w=1024\"

active is crucial to our understanding of how Mars evolved as a planet,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt can help us answer fundamental questions about the solar system and the state of Mars\u2019 core, mantle and the evolution of its currently-lacking magnetic field.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Scientists have long known that, billions of years ago, Mars had active volcanoes and vast intertwining rivers and lakes.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s part of the reason many believe that microscopic life may have once lived on the once-fertile grounds of Earth\u2019s mysterious neighbor.<\/p>\n<p>Rapid changes to the planet\u2019s atmosphere led its surface to become the barren, dusty wasteland that it is today.<\/p>\n<p>Some experts believe, however, that the old girl isn\u2019t out of action just yet.<\/p>\n<p>They have bickered for decades over whether Martian volcanoes are still active or just as dead as the rest of the planet.<\/p>\n<p>If there is indeed magma active under the planet\u2019s surface, the chances of life growing there are far higher.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s because microbes need a mix of heat, water and nutrients to survive. Moving, hot magma would provide one of those key ingredients.<\/p>\n<p><em>This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.<\/em> <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The search for signs of life on Mars is heating up.
