He was not in the Padres&#8217; lineup for Friday&#8217;s 11-6 win over the Atlanta Braves.<\/p>\n<p>The Padres plan to use Cano, 39, as a left-handed bat off the bench. Acting manager Ryan Christenson said he could get some occasional starts at second base and designated hitter.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a lot left in the tank,&#8221; Cano said. &#8220;I know I can still play this game and just go out on top.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Entering Thursday&#8217;s games, Padres designated hitters were batting .206 with two home runs and 12 RBIs this season. Both home runs came via Luke Voit, who bats right-handed, in Wednesday&#8217;s 7-5 loss to the Chicago Cubs.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/photo\/2019\/0520\/r545373_1296x1296_1-1.jpg&amp;w=130&amp;h=130&amp;scale=crop&amp;location=center\" width=\"65\" height=\"65\" \/><\/li>\n<li><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/photo\/2022\/0415\/r1000165_1296x1296_1-1.jpg&amp;w=130&amp;h=130&amp;scale=crop&amp;location=center\" width=\"65\" height=\"65\" \/><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>1 Related<\/p>\n<p>When Cano plays second base, it would move Jake Cronenworth to shortstop and Ha-Seong Kim to the bench.<\/p>\n<p>Kim is batting .200\/.326\/.388, and there is additional need at shortstop because of Fernando Tatis Jr.&#8217;s wrist injury and because top prospect C.J. Abrams was optioned back to the minor leagues after struggling earlier this season.<\/p>\n<p>Cano sat out last season while serving his second suspension for performance-enhancing drugs. He batted .195 (8-for-41) this season with one home run, three RBIs and a .501 OPS in 43 plate appearances for the National League East-leading Mets.<\/p>\n<p>He is owed $44,703,297 by the Mets from the remainder of the 10-year, $240 million contract he signed with the Seattle Mariners.
