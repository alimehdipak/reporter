Two grand juries in Texas have declined to pursue criminal charges, and Watson has denied all wrongdoing.<\/p>\n<p>The NFL is investigating whether Watson violated its code of conduct policy; the league interviewed Watson in person last week as part of its investigation. At the NFL&#8217;s spring meeting in Atlanta, commissioner Roger Goodell said he thinks the league is nearing the end of its investigation but couldn&#8217;t give a timeline for when a ruling might be made.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/photo\/2022\/0325\/r991202_1296x1296_1-1.jpg&amp;w=130&amp;h=130&amp;scale=crop&amp;location=center\" width=\"65\" height=\"65\" \/><\/li>\n<li><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/photo\/2022\/0417\/r1001143_1296x1296_1-1.jpg&amp;w=130&amp;h=130&amp;scale=crop&amp;location=center\" width=\"65\" height=\"65\" \/><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>1 Related<\/p>\n<p>In addition to slamming the Browns, Solis told HBO that she felt threatened by Watson after their massage session.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;He just said, &#8216;I know you have a career to protect,'&#8221; she said. &#8220;&#8216;And I know you don&#8217;t want anyone messing with it just like I don&#8217;t want anyone messing with mine.&#8217; To me, that&#8217;s when I got really scared.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Browns traded for Watson two months ago, sending the Houston Texans a trade package that included three first-round picks to complete the deal.
