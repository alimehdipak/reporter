Jewel Thief, a speakeasy in Manhattan\u2019s NoMad District, is offering up belly dancers to electric violinists. And Keys &amp; Heels, an Upper East Side speakeasy, has tapped a trio of magicians to work the tables.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Olivur Yu, a show producer who is providing the talent for opening night at Wonderland, has booked fire eaters, jugglers of axes and swords and avant-garde variety shows with drag and pole-dancing artists who use truck chains instead of silks.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere are some shocking moments. The acts are very tough,\u201d Yu said. \u201cPeople are risking their lives and their physical well being to create their art. This is full-body dedication.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>One of the sword swallowers is 36-year-old La Reine the Thrill, 36, of Brooklyn, who (it hurts to even write this) also will be inserting unusually long objects into nasal cavity.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/crazy-sword-entertainment-04.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Sam Urdang juggling axes at Wonderland.\" \/>Sam Urdang juggling axes at Wonderland.Courtesy of Hideki Aono    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/crazy-sword-entertainment-05.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Sam Urdang with axes\" \/>\u201cThere are some shocking moments,\u201d show producer Olivur Yu says. \u201cThe acts are very tough.\u201dCourtesy of Hideki Aono    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t intend to do this work. It found me,\u201d La Reine said. \u201cIt\u2019s not for the faint of heart. I never give up on my dream to just keep creating.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Jewel Thief, which opened last November at 30 West 30th St. down a staircase under the Italian eatery Spritz, features live performers, DJs and shared plates \u2014 from Neapolitan-style thin-crust pizzas and homemade pastas to wood-fired skirt steaks. There\u2019s also a $10,000 option to rent out the back of the vault, which includes a private bar and \u201ccurated entertainment.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Keys &amp; Heels, which opened last month at 1488 Second Ave., now offers \u201cMagic Unlocked\u201d twice a month. The space is a shoe repair and locksmith store that has been transformed into a hidden lounge. As patrons dine on light bites and cocktails, a trio of magicians move from table to table.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/crazy-sword-entertainment-03.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Sam Urdang, from left, Olivur Yu and Sword Swallower La Reine The Thrill.\" \/>Sam Urdang, Olivur Yu and Sword Swallower La Reine The Thrill outside Wonderland.
