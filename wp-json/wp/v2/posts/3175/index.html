Make sure you are buying broad-spectrum coverage, SPF 30+, water-resistant sunscreens.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Don&#8217;t smoke<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smoking makes your <a href=\"https:\/\/kingposting.com\/what-happens-when-varicose-veins-burst\/\">skin<\/a> age more quickly. Smoking also affects how wounds heal. And research shows that smoking can worsen skin diseases, like psoriasis and hidradenitis suppurativa.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Check your skin for skin cancer<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding skin cancer early can help when it is highly treatable.

This can worsen any skin condition, including acne. If you\u2019ve been sweating heavily or if you have a serious acne flare, it may seem natural to scrub your skin.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Gently wash your face<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gentle cleansing helps skin look its best. To gently cleanse your face, wet it with lukewarm water. Then apply a mild cleanser, gently applying the cleanser in a circular motion with your fingertips. Finish by completely rinsing off the cleanser and gently patting your face dry with a clean towel.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Stressless<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you are stressed, it can show in your skin through diseases like eczema and acne. These health conditions may be exacerbated by stress or appear when a person is under too much pressure.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We\u2019ve all heard it before: \u201cThe best beauty secret is to eat right and drink plenty of water.\u201d While that\u2019s true, there are many other things you can do to improve your&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":9,"featured_media":3176,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3175"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/9"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3175"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3175\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3175"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3175"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3175"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
