His latest shocking movie begins with a mother suffocating her 8-year-old son using a pillow, and that turned out to be one of the evening\u2019s lighter scenes.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Later on, during the many gruesome surgeries depicted, viewers\u2019 hands flew up to shield their faces from the full-view blood, organs and intestines that enveloped the screen. I was seated in the front row, which was practically a splash zone. Two confused, squirming, squealing women next to me surely got lost on the way to \u201cTop Gun: Maverick.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Can\u2019t blame them.

Because of the changing world, a growing portion of the population has taken to eating and metabolizing plastic. People no longer feel pain or suffer from disease (great!), so a lot of folks\u2019 new kink is cutting each other on street corners as a replacement for sex (barf!).<\/p>\n<p>Borrowing a page from the singing strippers of \u201cGypsy\u201d \u2014 \u201cYou gotta get a gimmick!\u201d \u2014 the main characters, Saul (Viggo Mortensen) and Caprice (L\u00e9a Seydoux), have enterprisingly turned the inconvenient growths into performance art. Caprice will surgically excise a shapely mass from Saul\u2019s person as a live audience snaps photos.\u00a0They\u2019re hotter than the MCU.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"549\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/crimes-of-the-future-15.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Surgeries become performance art. \" \/>Surgeries become performance art.

Perhaps pale, black-hood-wearing Saul is a stand-in for Tilda Swinton in a glass box at MoMA or a Banksy drawing shredding itself. However, the movie\u2019s tone is consistently somber and Mortensen called the film a \u201cnoir\u201d in an interview.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>A stab or two at humor comes from Kristen Stewart as Timlin, an employee of the tiny National Organ Registry alongside her boss Whippet (Don McKellar). Meek and with a much higher pitched voice than Stewart\u2019s Princess Diana, Timlin comically flutters her eyes at Saul like he\u2019s Harry Styles rather than a freakshow. After one of his performances, she whispers to him, \u201cSurgery is the new sex.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Doesn\u2019t get more dystopian than that.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/crimes-of-the-future-16.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"One gnarly character has grown extra ears and performs dances for audiences. \" \/>One gnarly character has grown extra ears and performs dances for audiences.

Saul and Caprice lay naked and entwined on an operating table covered in bloody cuts with \u201cwas it good for you?\u201d facial expressions. Saul, who\u2019s a medical mess, tries to force slop down his throat with the help of a chair that puts his spine and esophagus in proper alignment. Mortensen always swallows as he speaks, as if about to vomit.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not used to Cronenberg\u2019s body horror style that made him famous in the 1970s with films like \u201cShivers,\u201d you might actually vomit.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>More nausea will hit you when the father (Scott Speedman) of the smothered 8-year-old asks Saul to perform a public autopsy on the kid. The little boy was a plastic eater, and dad wants to expose that humanity has shifted, since the government is trying to hide that fact. They slice him open on an operating table that looks like a giant mummified acorn. The film fizzles out in the end.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The cool surgical tools that blend tech and living tissue are reminiscent of the director\u2019s 1999 movie \u201ceXistenZ.\u201d And Cronenberg\u2019s visuals, appalling though they may be, are characteristically striking. <\/p>\n<p>Trouble is for \u201cCrimes of the Future,\u201d audiences have to first remove their hands from their eyes to see them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At Thursday night\u2019s New York premiere of \u201cCrimes of the Future,\u201d controversial director David Cronenberg issued an ominous warning: \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll see you at the end.\u201d\u00a0 movie review Running time: 107 minutes&#8230;.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":3549,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[5],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3548"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/6"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3548"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3548\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3548"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3548"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3548"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
