Piccolo, who played for the Bears from 1966 to &#8217;69, was 26 years old at the time of his death in 1970. His close relationship with Bears Hall of Fame running back Gale Sayers was the subject of the movie &#8220;Brian&#8217;s Song,&#8221; which chronicled their friendship as the first interracial roommates in the NFL. The Bears initially planned to honor Piccolo on the 50th anniversary of his death, but the COVID-19 pandemic eliminated offseason practices in 2020.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nfl\/500\/bal.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Lamar Jackson not saying how he&#8217;ll handle training camp, season without new contract<br \/>Jackson said he spoke with the Baltimore Ravens about his contract situation this week, but the former NFL MVP was noncommittal about whether he would report to training camp or play at the start of the season without a new deal. Jackson, though, expressed confidence when asked if he believed he would play in Baltimore for the rest of his career. &#8220;I expect so,&#8221; Jackson said Thursday. &#8220;So, yes, I do.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nfl\/500\/kc.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Patrick Mahomes says he was &#8216;surprised&#8217; by Tyreek Hill&#8217;s critical comments<br \/>Mahomes said Thursday he was surprised by the comments made by Hill on a recent podcast that were critical of him and the Chiefs. &#8220;I&#8217;m surprised a little just because I feel like we love Tyreek here,&#8221; Mahomes said as the Chiefs finished their offseason program. &#8220;We&#8217;ve always loved him. We still love him. I saw him out at Formula One in Miami.

Not only is Fitzpatrick, 25, the highest paid at his position, but the Steelers&#8217; defense is among the league&#8217;s most expensive in both cash and cap value. But that money doesn&#8217;t motivate the defense to perform, Fitzpatrick said Thursday. Instead, it affirms the players&#8217; duty to perform to a standard expected with a paycheck that large.<\/p>\n<p>More NFL headlines:<\/p>\n<h2><b>Best videos<\/b><\/h2>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>On this day 52 years ago we lost Brian Piccolo.<\/p>\n<p>Today, all 90 players are wearing 41 to honor him. pic.twitter.com\/OFLIfKAJoJ<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Chicago Bears (@ChicagoBears) June 16, 2022<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>How much you wanna make a bet I can throw a football over them mountains? \ud83e\udd23@jamesproche3 @Lj_era8 pic.twitter.com\/01XcaSO7E3<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Baltimore Ravens (@Ravens) June 16, 2022<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>LOOK AT HIM GO\u203c\ufe0f@BigIck79 pic.twitter.com\/5VBwddjuRA<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Carolina Panthers (@Panthers) June 16, 2022<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>Right where it needs to be.@ZachWilson  @T_Conk1 pic.twitter.com\/5WKQUKj3rR<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 New York Jets (@nyjets) June 16, 2022<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>Things we&#8217;ll never get tired of watching: this.@patrickmahomes x @tkelce pic.twitter.com\/IryfE1o1Jl<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Kansas City Chiefs (@Chiefs) June 16, 2022<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>Behind the scenes at Media Day &#8217;22  pic.twitter.com\/br59foroiy<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Tennessee Titans (@Titans) June 16, 2022<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p> pic.twitter.com\/HfuwKBMpXd<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Arizona Cardinals (@AZCardinals) June 16, 2022<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>Get \ud83c\udd99 @KingCole_Turner pic.twitter.com\/fcMJG4J2bj<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Washington Commanders (@Commanders) June 16, 2022<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>RB group taking in the stadium on the last day of minicamp pic.twitter.com\/b2vRCJ7ayA<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Cleveland Browns (@Browns) June 16, 2022<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>Minicamp is complete, but @GradyJarrett stays on the grind  pic.twitter.com\/cTpa45OxPa<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Atlanta Falcons (@AtlantaFalcons) June 16, 2022<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>.@MikeyQuince&#8217;s annoyed there&#8217;s only 3 takeaways<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Los Angeles Chargers (@chargers) June 16, 2022<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2><b>Quotes of the day<\/b><\/h2>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\"><p>&#8220;The money is a blessing, the money creates opportunity for everyone around us and in our families, but it&#8217;s more what they&#8217;re saying with the money.
