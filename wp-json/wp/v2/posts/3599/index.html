After all, it\u2019s the first step towards achieving your dream smile.<\/p>\n<p>Before we tell you what to expect from your first smile makeover, let\u2019s talk about what a smile makeover actually is.<\/p>\n<h2>What is a smile makeover?<\/h2>\n<p>A smile makeover is a full-mouth restoration, meaning that it is a combination of cosmetic and restorative dentistry. Its aim is to repair and enhance your smile\u2019s outlook. This allows patients with imperfect smiles to achieve perfection and gain their lost confidence back.<\/p>\n<p>So what to expect from your first smile makeover? Read along to find out!<\/p>\n<h2>Smile makeover consultation<\/h2>\n<p>The goal of your smile makeover consultation is to help your dentist determine the best way to improve your smile\u2019s appearance. This is why the dentist will ask you about your concerns, and preferences and educate you about the best possible <a href=\"https:\/\/probuzz.mystrikingly.com\/blog\/why-does-periodontal-treatment-become-necessary\">treatment<\/a> plan.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s look at what goes on during your first smile makeover consultation.<\/p>\n<h3>1. New smile design<\/h3>\n<p>At the start of the consultation, your dentist will talk about your preferences and concerns. Don\u2019t worry if you are unsure about it. The dentist will offer recommendations about what procedures will be best for your unique case.<\/p>\n<p>After that, the dentist will examine your oral structure, face shape, lip size, complexion, and <a href=\"https:\/\/webdental.com\/blogs\/how-to-get-rid-of-a-gum-abscess-without-going-to-the-dentist\">gums<\/a>. The dentist will then use this information to create a customized treatment plan for you. This treatment plan will fix all of your oral health issues and make it look as natural as possible.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Dental health evaluation<\/h3>\n<p>After crafting the treatment plan, your dentist will evaluate your overall health. They do so by going through your medical history. This is because some dental treatments aren\u2019t for people with certain health conditions. For example, diabetic patients have difficulty in healing. So, they may not undergo minor oral surgeries, like dental implant installation. But there are several other alternative options for patients with a slow-healing rate.<\/p>\n<p>During smile makeover consultation, the dentist will also conduct multiple diagnostic tests, like x-rays and CT scans. These tests make sure that the patient is eligible for certain dental work.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Finalizing treatment plan<\/h3>\n<p>Once the dentist is sure about your eligibility for the procedures, they will finalize the dates and related costs. The time required for the complete smile makeover depends on the types of treatments your plan has. For example, procedures like dental bonding can be completed much quicker than treatments like dental implants.<\/p>\n<p>Your smile makeover can include treatments like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Teeth whitening<\/li>\n<li>Dental implants<\/li>\n<li>Tooth bonding<\/li>\n<li>Veneers<\/li>\n<li>Crowns<\/li>\n<li>Gum reshaping<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you want to get a smile makeover, please don\u2019t hesitate to contact\u00a0Houston Dentist\u00a0at\u00a0Champions Dental.
