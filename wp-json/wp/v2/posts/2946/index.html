He signed for Barcelona on a free transfer but soon after was forced into premature retirement at the age of 33 after the emergence of a heart condition.<\/p>\n<p>In tribute to the Argentine striker&#8217;s career and significant contribution to the City cause, the club have erected a statue of him on the concourse outside their Etihad stadium.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>Eternamente gracias! \/\/ Thank you eternally, @ManCity  https:\/\/t.co\/DyfcUS3BSK<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Sergio Kun Aguero (@aguerosergiokun) May 13, 2022<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Created using thousands of pieces of galvanised steel, the glittering statue emerged at daybreak on Friday morning and depicted Aguero whirling his shirt around his head after scoring his most famous goal.<\/p>\n<p>Located outside the east stand and illuminated by sky-blue spotlights at night, it stands shoulder to shoulder alongside statues of two other modern-day City greats, namely Vincent Kompany and David Silva, who too have had their careers immortalised with similar steel artworks.<\/p>\n<p>Aguero himself even dropped by the stadium to give the statue his seal of approval and looked suitably impressed while being given the guided tour.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Truthfully, it is a very beautiful thing for me, to see myself 10 years ago is very moving,&#8221; the striker said. &#8220;In those 10 years I was able to win a lot of trophies and was able to help the club become one of the most important in the world. I am very grateful to the club for making this statue in recognition of my football career in Manchester.
