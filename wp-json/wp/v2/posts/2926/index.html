Wall switch timers require hard-wire installation, but you can usually control more lights with these timers.<\/p>\n<h3>Can you get a timer for a light switch?<\/h3>\n<p>A timer switch for lights can fit over existing light swtiches, a simple and convenient method without the need for wires or complicated installs, allowing lighting to be turned on and off on a timed basis. A socket with timer ensures that no valuable sockets are lost to the timer itself.<\/p>\n<p>Do timer switches need a neutral?<\/p>\n<p>Many electrical timers require a neutral so that the switch can be powered without sending power to the load. If you do not have a neutral at the switch box it means that the power source (line) does not come into that box and you are just switching the hot from another source.<\/p>\n<p>Do LED bulbs work with timers?<\/p>\n<p>Do LED Lights Work with Timers? Timers are fully compatible with energy-saving bulbs and LEDs.<\/p>\n<p>What is an in wall timer?<\/p>\n<p>In-wall timers are the simplest step in moving your house towards an automated home or smart home. These simple-to-use devices give you control over lights, motors, heaters and other electrical devices without the use of multiple light switches.<\/p>\n<h3>Are timers a fire risk?<\/h3>\n<p>A timer is not likely to cause a fire in a home than any other electrical device. There is no logic to a timer. Cristmas decoration fires are usually caused by overloading circuits, worn cords and damaged equipment.<\/p>\n<p>Can smart plugs be used as timers?<\/p>\n<p>Smart plugs also let you set timers on how long something is turned on. However, one of the most useful features of a smart plug is the scheduling functionality. This allows you to create down-to-the-minute schedules for when appliances receive power.<\/p>\n<p>How do you use a timer switch?<\/p>\n<p>Switch the timer on and plug it into an electrical outlet.<\/p>\n<p>Locate the power switch on the side of your timer and move it to the ON or AUTO position, which might also be marked with a picture of a clock. Plug the timer into a free wall socket where you want to connect a light.<\/p>\n<p>How do you set a digital timer?<\/p>\n<p>How to Set a Digital Indoor Light Timer<br \/>Install the batteries. Set the current date and time. Set the weekday \u201con\u201d times. Select the \u201coff\u201d time in the same manner as the \u201con\u201d time. Set the weekend \u201con\/off\u201d times.<\/p>\n<h3>How do light timer switches work?<\/h3>\n<p>A light timer is an electrical circuit with a built-in clock. Acting as a communicator between the power source and the light, the timer turns lights on and off based on the times you set. Available in a variety of sizes, these devices come equipped with controls ranging from circular dials to digital settings.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s a neutral wire do?<\/p>\n<p>Neutral wire carries the circuit back to the original power source. More specifically, neutral wire brings the circuit to a ground or busbar usually connected at the electrical panel. This gives currents circulation through your electrical system, which allows electricity to be fully utilized.<\/p>\n<p>Can halogen bulbs be used with timers?<\/p>\n<p>Timers that work without a neutral connection must get power by trickling current through the bulb when off and dropping some voltage (bulb is slightly dimmed) when on. This works well with incandescent and halogen bulbs but not necessarily with CFL or LED bulbs.<\/p>\n<p>Do I need a special timer for LED lights?<\/p>\n<p>So your LEDs may turn on but when the timer tries to turn them off, it can\u2019t detect the LEDs. The result is a timer in \u201coff\u201d mode but your LED bulbs are still lit. For that reason, it\u2019s best if you use digital timers to control your LEDs.<\/p>\n<p>Which is the best timer switch?<\/p>\n<p>Best Light Switch Timers Reviews<br \/>BN-LINK Programmable In-Wall Timer Switch.
