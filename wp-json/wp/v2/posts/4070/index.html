They found I have a blood disorder called prothrombin gene mutation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The beauty continued: \u201cAnd then they diagnosed me with a gastritis disease.

It was nice because my mom, a single mom, was able to take a break, relax and eat some really good wings.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She added: \u201cThey could have just dropped off the food and kept it moving.

But we are so much more.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She further declared: \u201cI know so many girls who are studying and thinking about their futures. They have dreams of becoming lawyers and doctors.
