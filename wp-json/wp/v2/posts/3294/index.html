While otherwise clean and minimalistic, the shirt is accentuated by shimmering pops of pearlescent trim that, according to Nike, serve as a nod to all the &#8220;shining lights&#8221; who have served to advance the cause of women&#8217;s football over the years. The inner collar also carries the inscription, &#8220;Send her victorious&#8221; &#8212; an apt line selected from the national anthem that will be sung with gusto by the team before every match.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/soccer\/blog-the-toe-poke\/story\/4674649\/\" \/>Nike<\/p>\n<p>The away kit is a vibrant design that strays from England&#8217;s traditional red and into the realms of Nike describes as crimson, although you&#8217;d be forgiven for describing it as a shade of orange. The trim is dark red and boasts a similar glossy feel to that used on the home kit.<\/p>\n<h2>France<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/soccer\/blog-the-toe-poke\/story\/4674649\/\" \/>Nike<\/p>\n<p>The France home shirt for Euro 2022 is a bright, royal-blue base which is furnished all over in an ornate floral pattern inspired by neoclassical Gallic art. The famous <i>tricolor<\/i> of the national flag is completed by the red-and-white trim.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/soccer\/blog-the-toe-poke\/story\/4674649\/\" \/>Nike<\/p>\n<p><i>Les Bleues<\/i> can switch to play in a white uniform that continues the neoclassical theme thanks to the flock pattern found on the pink strips that run along the seams of the shirt. The badges and crest are resplendent in metallic rose gold, while the French flag can also be spotted on the sleeve cuff in the form of a small cloth tab.<\/p>\n<h2>Netherlands<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/soccer\/blog-the-toe-poke\/story\/4674649\/\" \/>Nike<\/p>\n<p>No prizes for guessing that the Dutch home kit is an all-Oranje outfit, though the traditional national colours have been given a contemporary edge with an ultra-clean design.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/soccer\/blog-the-toe-poke\/story\/4674649\/\" \/>Nike<\/p>\n<p>The white, blue and red away kit is a little busier by virtue of a blocky, abstract aesthetic inspired by the <i>De Stijl<\/i> art movement of the early 20th century.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>NikeWith the start of the UEFA Women&#8217;s European Championship six weeks away, Nike has unveiled kits for several of the top nations competing at the tournament.Stars from hosts England, France and defending champions Netherlands have all been given new jerseys to wear when the action kicks off on July 6, and they&#8217;ll be hoping to&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":3295,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[13],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3294"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3294"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3294\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3294"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3294"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3294"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
