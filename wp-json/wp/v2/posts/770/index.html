Well, now&#8217;s a good time to start anew. Throw the 16 remaining teams into an auction-style draft in which you buy teams with real money and pay out to the Final Four teams, finalists and national champion. It&#8217;s a different form of the standard bracket pool and can be a lot of fun.<\/p>\n<p>Want a new spin on a bracket? Find 16 people to fill a capture bracket. Everyone gets one team, and winners advance based on the ATS result. Your team could lose but cover the spread and you &#8220;capture&#8221; the other team. With four rounds left, you might have three different teams to root for!<\/p>\n<p>And then, of course, there&#8217;s this thing called wagering on a game. Imagine that! Find a money line or spread you like and just place a wager. And you can do it in-game, too! Did you miss a future before the tourney started? You can still bet any of the 16 teams right now to win the region or title.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some nuggets to help you the rest of the way.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/g.espncdn.com\/lm-static\/challenges\/TC-Promo-Assets\/PR_Fantasy_TournamentChallengePromo_SecondChance_16x9_20967.jpg\" width=\"100%\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Complete your bracket by selecting the winner in each of the games in the NCAA tournament from the Sweet 16 to the championship. <b>Tournament Challenge Second Chance<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\u2022 This is Duke&#8217;s 26th Sweet 16 game under Mike Krzyzewski. It&#8217;s just the fourth time the Blue Devils have been an underdog. Duke lost all three previous Sweet 16 games under Coach K in which it was a dog. Only the loss to Oregon in 2016 was decided by more than six points.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Since expansion, there have been 20 underdogs of at least 12 points in the Sweet 16. The only one to win outright was Indiana +13 over Duke in 2002. The only other two to even lose by single digits were Arkansas vs. North Carolina and George Washington vs. Michigan, both coming in 1993.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 There have been three 10-seed vs. 11-seed matchups in the Sweet 16. In all three instances, the underdog won outright and in two of the three instances reached the Final Four (VCU in 2011 and Syracuse in 2016).<\/p>\n<p><img data-src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2020\/1012\/r759648_1296x729_16-9.png\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2020\/1012\/r759648_1296x729_16-9.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>A daily sports betting news and information show (6-7 p.m. ET, ESPN2) that aims to better serve the millions of sports fans who participate in sports wagering and help educate general sports fans with in-depth analysis. <b>Watch \u00bb<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\u2022 There have been 22 previous No. 1 seeds to win their round-of-32 game by five points or fewer.

Since 1985, 15 of the 22 wound up winning their Sweet 16 game (10 covered).<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 There have been eight 1-seeds that were either an underdog or favored by two points or fewer in a Sweet 16 game.
