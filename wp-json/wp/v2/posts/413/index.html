And it&#8217;s important to be able to accept a wide variety of customer payments, like credit and debit cards, electronic wallets, and prepaid cards.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>A payment processor collects financial data from the customer, verifies that information with the bank or payment provider, and processes the transaction. A full payment processing system needs a payment processor, a payment gateway and a merchant account.<\/p>\n<p>Some payment processing services offer one or all of these elements. For example, Stripe offers an all-in-one solution, while competitor Authorize.net only offers a payment gateway. This article will include a full breakdown of Stripe vs. Authorize.net to help you decide which online payment processor is best for your business.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2>Stripe vs. Authorize.net<\/h2>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Similarities<\/td>\n<td>Differences<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Both offer payment gateways.<\/td>\n<td>Stripe offers additional payment services.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>They are easy to integrate.<\/td>\n<td>Authorize.net charges a setup fee.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>They can process the same payment methods or credit cards.<\/td>\n<td>Stripe is better for third-party integrations.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Both are very secure options.<\/td>\n<td>Stripe requires more development or coding experience.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>The main difference between Stripe and Authorize.net comes down to the service the companies offer. Stripe is a full-fledged payment service provider, which means it comes with everything you need to accept and process online payments.

Though its service offerings are a bit more limited, Authorize.net is easier to understand and integrate from start to finish.<\/p>\n<p>Both services have a wide range of features and are suitable for different business types. For instance, Stripe is the better option if you don&#8217;t already have some kind of payment-related service setup. It&#8217;s also a better choice if you&#8217;re looking to get your e-commerce business up and running immediately.

Let&#8217;s go into more detail about these comparisons.<\/p>\n<h3>Plans<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Stripe: Stripe only offers two plans \u2013 Integrated and Customized. Integrated is the standard choice for most companies because it includes everything you need to begin accepting online payments. There are no monthly or hidden fees, and you&#8217;ll receive hundreds of feature updates each year. The Customized plan is better for enterprise companies that need custom payment options.<\/li>\n<li>Authorize.net: Authorize.net also offers two plans, and both have a monthly fee of $25. The All-in-One plan sets you up with the payment gateway, a merchant account and payment processing service from one of its partnered companies. The Payment Gateway Only plan, as the name indicates, just includes the payment gateway.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Winner: Tie \u2013 it really depends on what you need out of a payment service provider.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Pricing<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Stripe: Stripe&#8217;s pricing depends on which payment plan you choose. The Integrated plan allows you to pay as you go and charges a 2.9% fee plus 30 cents for every transaction. The Customized plan gives you custom pricing options. Stripe also offers a $59 card reader and a POS terminal for $249.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.business.com\/images\/content\/61d\/84dba9c658a742a8b4567\/624-361-\" alt=\"Stripe.com\" width=\"624\" height=\"361\" \/>Stripe has straightforward pricing and no hidden fees.<\/p>\n<p>Source: Stripe.com<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Authorize.net: Authorize.net also has two payment options, both with a $25 monthly fee. The All-in-One plan is for businesses that don&#8217;t already have a merchant account. You&#8217;ll pay a fee of 2.9% plus 30 cents per successful credit card transaction, which is the same as what Stripe charges. The Payment Gateway Only plan has a fee of 10 cents per transaction and a daily fee of 10 cents.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Winner: Stripe. The two payment services charge similar fees, but Stripe gives the option for additional products. And unlike Authorize.net, Stripe doesn&#8217;t charge monthly fees.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.business.com\/images\/content\/61d\/84e3d9c658a762a8b4567\/623-350-\" alt=\"Authorize.net\" width=\"623\" height=\"350\" \/>With Authorize.net, you can choose between two direct payment plans.<\/p>\n<p>Source: Authorize.net<\/p>\n<h3>Features<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Stripe: Stripe comes with a payment gateway, merchant account and payment processing abilities. You can start accepting customer payments immediately, and Stripe accepts most payment types. Plus, the company offers tools \u2013 like a custom UI toolkit and API. You can also take advantage of Stripe Connect, which allows you to customize various aspects of your marketplace and checkout process.<\/li>\n<li>Authorize.net: Authorize.net only includes a payment gateway, but the company can connect you to one of its partners if you need a merchant account or payment processor. Aside from its basic payment gateway service, Authorize.net offers a simple checkout solution, invoicing controls and automated recurring billing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Winner: Stripe, because it&#8217;s an all-in-one solution with more features and tools than Authorize.net.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Ease of use<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Stripe: Stripe&#8217;s user interface and dashboard are both well designed. However, if you want to maximize this payment service provider&#8217;s toolkit, it&#8217;s best if you are comfortable using the developer API and in-depth controls.<\/li>\n<li>Authorize.net: Authorize.net is much easier to use and set up. The service easily integrates with your existing merchant account or payment processing service. Additionally, if you want to be set up with one of its partnered payment processors for merchant accounts, the company can walk you through the process.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Winner: Authorize.net, as Stripe&#8217;s wider range of tools and customizations has a steeper learning curve.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Integrations<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Stripe: Stripe has over 300 possible integrations, including Zoho CRM, Xero, ShipStation and Commerce Sync.<\/li>\n<li>Authorize.net: Authorize.net makes integrations easy through Simple Checkout, which lets you integrate your marketplace with third-party tools. It can also integrate with Commerce Sync.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Winner: Stripe. Both solutions have third-party integrations, but Stripe&#8217;s options are more extensive than Authorize.net&#8217;s.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Support<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Stripe: Stripe provides customer support through three major channels \u2013 email, live chat and phone. You can take advantage of 24\/7 support, and the live chat response usually only takes a couple of minutes. You&#8217;ll also benefit from an extensive knowledge base if you need help tinkering with Stripe&#8217;s code.<\/li>\n<li>Authorize.net: Authorize.net offers a 24\/7 support center, which you can contact online or by phone. You can also open a support ticket if you have a more complex question or if a customer service representative isn&#8217;t immediately available to help you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Winner: Stripe, thanks to its in-depth knowledge base with how-to articles and programming support.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Employee self-service<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Stripe: Stripe is a much more hands-on option than Authorize.net. That&#8217;s because it includes a full kit of developer tools that you can use to add functions or features to your payment processing system at any time. You can change your payment page and mobile checkout experience to better meet your customers&#8217; needs. You can also use the third-party integrations for employee self-service tools \u2013 like clocking in and out, or checking inventory.<\/li>\n<li>Authorize.net: Authorize.net is not nearly as customizable as Stripe, and it doesn&#8217;t come with the same spread of employee tools. But it does have a full customer information manager (CIM) suite, where you can store customer information and pull it up at any time. This could be helpful for employees at your brick-and-mortar store or allow you to access sensitive information online.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Winner: Stripe, but only if you take the time to fully develop and customize the payment processing service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Additional services<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Stripe: Stripe offers a wide array of services beyond its payment processing features. For instance, Stripe Sigma is an advanced reporting system you can access from the main dashboard. There&#8217;s also Radar, a fraud monitoring tool that allows you or other merchants to review and override transactions. Stripe also makes it easy to display currencies and conversions in multiple formats, and it automatically updates credit card data in your customer vault to ensure that subscriptions are current.<\/li>\n<li>Authorize.net: Authorize.net offers a handful of services beyond its basic payment gateway. That includes a CIM, e-check processing, QuickBooks integration and advanced fraud detection. The advanced fraud detection suite is included for free with your account and comes with 13 filters you can customize to block fraudulent transactions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Winner: Tie, because both services offer a wide range of tools.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Stripe vs. Authorize.net recap\u00a0<\/h2>\n<p>Both Stripe and Authorize.net are worthy choices to accept online payments for your e-commerce business.
