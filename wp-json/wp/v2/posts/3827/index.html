In fact, most people who encounter buffalo mozzarella don\u2019t even realize that it\u2019s made from buffalo milk; they assume it\u2019s as closely related to buffalo as Buffalo wings are.<\/p>\n<p>mozzarella, mild, smooth-textured cheese made in its authentic Italian version from the milk of the water buffalo; imitations of varying quality are commonly made of cow\u2019s milk.<\/p>\n<p>Mozzarella cheese is a sliceable curd cheese originating in Italy. Traditional Mozzarella cheese is made from milk of water buffalos herded in very few countries such as Italy and Bulgaria. As a result, most of the Mozzarella cheeses available now are made from cow\u2019s milk.<\/p>\n<p>Mozzarella is relatively low in fat and calories. This makes it a healthier cheese option compared to others. Mozzarella contains probiotics such as the bacteria Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus fermentum.<\/p>\n<p>Vegans can eat cheese that is comprised of plant-based ingredients like soybeans, peas, cashews, coconut, or almonds. The most common types of vegan cheeses are cheddar, gouda, parmesan, mozzarella, and cream cheese that can be found in non-dairy forms.<\/p>\n<p>Goat cheese, often called by its French name, ch\u00e8vre, is any cheese made entirely from goat\u2019s milk. Goat milk is low in casein, a milk protein that curdles, so it produces a very small, soft curds that crumble easily.<\/p>\n<p>Mozzarella cheese has a long span and if refrigerated, it can last up to one month. In some cases, it can last more than 6 months as well. On the other hand, cheddar cheese has an amazing life span compared to mozzarella cheese and can easily last more than 6 months.<\/p>\n<p>Mozzarella is safe to eat raw, as in cold, fresh, soft, straight out of the packet and not cooked \u2013 if it\u2019s made from pasteurized milk.<\/p>\n<p>All dairy products naturally contain lactose, because it\u2019s one of the sugars found in milk. That includes cheeses like mozzarella. Cheese generally contains less lactose than milk, because the lactose is removed in the process of creating the cheese.<\/p>\n<p>Traditionally, feta cheese is made with 100% sheep\u2019s milk or with up to 30% of goat\u2019s milk mixed in. The cheesemaker adds rennet to coagulate the milk, producing a curd that is separated from the whey and pressed into molds to drain off excess moisture.<\/p>\n<p>The process of making mozzarella is called pasta filata. The milk is incubated with a whey starter containing thermophilic bacteria and then rennet is added to form the curds. The curds are heated in water or whey until they form strings (hence the term \u201cstring cheese\u201d) and become elastic in texture.<\/p>\n<p>Unhealthy Cheeses<br \/>Halloumi Cheese. Be aware of how much of this squeaky cheese you\u2019re adding to your morning bagel and salads! Goats\/ Blue Cheese. 1 oz. Roquefort Cheese.

Cheddar Cheese.<\/p>\n<p>As long as you don\u2019t have a sensitivity to lactose or dairy, eating cheese every day can be part of your healthy eating plan. In addition to the protein and calcium benefits, cheese is a fermented food and can supply a good source of probiotics for a healthy gut. The trick is to enjoy it in moderation.<\/p>\n<p>Since cottage cheese is high in protein but low in calories, it is often recommended for weight loss. Several studies indicate that eating high-protein foods like cottage cheese can increase feelings of fullness and help decrease overall calorie intake, which in turn may lead to weight loss ( 19 , 20 ).<\/p>\n<p>Sweet and nutty in flavor, sheep\u2019s milk cheeses are often higher in protein and fat than cow\u2019s milk cheeses. Feta is a brined block cheese that crumbles like a dream, but is also great for cubing into salads. Halloumi is a squeaky, grill-able cheese that offers a fun introduction to sheep\u2019s milk cheeses.<\/p>\n<p>Which cheeses are not vegetarian? Parmesan cheese is never vegetarian. Cheeses from a specific location need to follow a consistent recipe to be recognised as having specific names. In the case of Parmigiano-Reggiano, or Parmesan cheese, this means always using animal rennet.<\/p>\n<p>What is rennet? Rennet is a set of enzymes used to coagulate milk during cheesemaking. These enzymes help cheesemakers separate the liquid whey from the solid curd that will eventually become cheese.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mozzarella is one of the only cheeses you\u2019ll encounter on a regular basis that\u2019s made from the milk of water buffalo.
