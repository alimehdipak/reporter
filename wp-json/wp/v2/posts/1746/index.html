Green&#8217;s choice to have his defenders give Paul space by going under pick-and-rolls backfired when Paul made three 3-pointers in a row as he attacked a switching defense that repeatedly left him up against the slower Larry Nance Jr.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s like inviting me [to] shoot,&#8221; said Paul, who looked over at Green several times after splashing shots. &#8220;I know Willie; that&#8217;s my man. It&#8217;s all a part of the game.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Green, who was an assistant with the Suns last season and played with Paul on the LA Clippers and the then-New Orleans Hornets, used a bench-heavy lineup that cut a 23-point Phoenix lead down to just six by early in the fourth quarter.<\/p>\n<p>But Paul broke the strategy as he repeatedly called for center Deandre Ayton to set a screen and force Nance into a switch. Eventually, Green had to pull Nance, who had been very effective with Paul on the bench, from the game.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We went under a couple screens, and he just stood behind and shot the 3 ball,&#8221; Green said of Paul. &#8220;The mix-ups were on our part, my part as a coach. I have to do better with that coverage. Chris, this is just what he does.&#8221;<\/p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><\/th>\n<th>Player<\/th>\n<th>Age<\/th>\n<th>Team<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Sun.<\/td>\n<td>Chris Paul<\/td>\n<td>36(y)-346(d)<\/td>\n<td>PHX<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2010<\/td>\n<td>Steve Nash<\/td>\n<td>36(y)-85(d)<\/td>\n<td>PHX<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2020<\/td>\n<td>LeBron James<\/td>\n<td>35(y)-271(d)<\/td>\n<td>LAL<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<tfoot>\n<tr>\n<td><i>&#8212; ESPN Stats &amp; Information<\/i><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tfoot>\n<\/table>\n<p>Paul scored or assisted on 23 of the Suns&#8217; 31 points in the fourth quarter. His 19 points in the frame were the second most in the final quarter in his career.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That man is a true competitor and a true winner,&#8221; said Suns star Devin Booker, who tallied 25 points. &#8220;When he wants it that bad, you can see it in his demeanor and see it in his walk, so it shouldn&#8217;t surprise anyone. He&#8217;s built for these moments.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Suns held the Pelicans to 22% shooting in the first half as Mikal Bridges, who was named a finalist for NBA Defensive Player of the Year, smothered Pelicans guard CJ McCollum. The Pelicans shot just 2-of-16 for the game when Bridges was the primary defender, according to ESPN Stats &amp; Information tracking. McCollum finished with 25 points but missed 16 shots and was 0-for-9 with Bridges on him.<\/p>\n<p>Paul also played excellent defense, coming up with three steals.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just his ability to understand he needs to take over a game,&#8221; Suns coach Monty Williams said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve been around anybody like Chris who has that innate feel for that time.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><em>ESPN&#8217;s Andrew Lopez contributed to this report. <\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>PHOENIX &#8212; First, Chris Paul heard his former teammate and coach Willie Green instruct the New Orleans Pelicans to dare him to shoot.
