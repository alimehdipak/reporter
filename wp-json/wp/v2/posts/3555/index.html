To help creators overcome everyday challenges, we\u2019re launching a new video on the Google for Creators YouTube channel called \u201cCreator Makeover.\u201d The show pairs a creator struggling with some common problems with more experienced creators who can help them move toward success.<\/p>\n<p>The hosts of our first Creator Makeover are London-based travel bloggers Yaya Onalaja-Aliu and Lloyd Griffiths, who grew their Hand Luggage Only blog and website from a dorm-room project to a successful brand that now has over 1 million unique visitors to the blog a month. Lloyd and Yaya worked with health and fitness entrepreneur Elle Linton of KeepItSimpELLE to help her expand her online presence, grow her audience and gain more revenue.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLike many creators, Elle was struggling with \u2018How do I make [my website] my business?\u2019\u201d Lloyd reflects. \u201cThe reality is, you need traffic to monetize your content. But you don\u2019t want to produce rubbish content just for the sake of posting. If you want to make more money, you have to create and post quality content across platforms to get your message to a wider audience.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Lloyd and Yaya worked with Elle to earn more passive income from advertising and affiliate links. To get there, they helped her create a content plan and adapt her blog content onto Instagram. \u201cDo some homework to understand what works for the audience on each platform,\u201d Yaya says. \u201cWhat you post on Facebook isn\u2019t the same as what you share on TikTok.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The show follows Elle\u2019s progress over the course of several weeks, as she implements Lloyd and Yaya\u2019s \u201cmakeover\u201d advice. After commiting to regularly posting more content, Elle expands her reach \u2014 increasing traffic by 10 percent and engagement by 150 percent. \u201cThe content plan helped me know what to create, when to create it and who to create it for,\u201d Elle notes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As a creator, it can be hard to know how to take your content, your online presence and your brand to the next level.
