Readers noted as much online \u2014 while drawing a number of comparisons to \u201cZoolander,\u201d as well as the iconic image of \u201cSeinfeld\u201d character George Costanza posed alluringly in only socks and undies on a fainting couch.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was the goal here?\u201d journalist Mairead Elordi asked about the photo in question, snapped by Chris Buck. Newtown shooting survivor and anti-violence advocate JT Lewis added to the sentiment, \u201cI just don\u2019t understand how this probably had to be approved by a slew of people and no one objected.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere has not been enough cringe produced in all of human history to properly react to this,\u201d author Jim Hanson responded to the photo.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI too \u2018relax with the paper\u2019 while sitting uncomfortably on the floor right next to my desk and chaise,\u201d Noah Blum\u00a0joked.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDraw me like one of your French girls,\u201d RealClearInvestigations senior writer Mark Hemingway\u00a0parodied, along with another who quipped in a now-deleted reply, \u201cI bet he has many leather bound books, and his office smells of rich mahogany.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Writer Shawn McCreesh aptly conveyed Kahn \u2014 heir to \u201cjournalism\u2019s Iron Throne,\u201d the reporter mused, as well as his father\u2019s co-founding Staples fortune \u2014 as privileged and \u201cfabulously wealthy,\u201d thanks to an elite Boston upbringing that led to a prestigious boarding school education before graduating from Harvard.<\/p>\n<p>During one passage, McCreesh described the top editor\u2019s enviable lifestyle with his wife Shannon, who formerly worked at the World Bank, and two elite school-educated sons, while insisting they\u2019re not \u201cflashy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Unconvincingly, McCreesh wrote, \u201cBut he does have a taste for the finer things.
