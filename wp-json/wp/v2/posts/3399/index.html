You might also have leaves or other natural material building up in or around your air conditioner. As it decays, the air conditioner will blow the vinegar smell into the cabin.<\/p>\n<h3>Why does my AC air smell like vinegar?<\/h3>\n<p>Excess Condensation<\/p>\n<p>Condensation is usually collected in a pan and drained out of the air conditioner or filtered back through to cool more air. But if too much condensation is produced, which could happen in an extremely humid atmosphere, the coils may begin to smell like vinegar.<\/p>\n<p>Why does my car AC have a sour smell?<\/p>\n<p>Mold and Bacteria<\/p>\n<p>As the car becomes older, bacteria, mold, fungi, and micro-organisms can start to grow. The growth of these bacteria is often behind the dash panel on the evaporator. This causes an unpleasant odor coming out the air conditioner unit.<\/p>\n<p>What does it mean if you smell vinegar?<\/p>\n<p>Secondary hyperhidrosis means that the cause of a person\u2019s excessive sweating is an underlying health condition or is a side effect of medication. When sweat mixes with bacteria on the skin, a person may notice it smells like vinegar.<\/p>\n<p>Does battery acid smell like vinegar?<\/p>\n<p>Like we\u2019ve mentioned, vinegar smells usually indicate there\u2019s something acidic in the car. One of the most acidic things in your car would be its battery. Sometimes, these may start leaking.<\/p>\n<h3>How do you fix a smelly air conditioner?<\/h3>\n<p>Blow compressed air from a distance to ensure that internal components do not get damaged. Use a brush or a smaller piece of cloth to clean the finer dust particles in the front and rear of the unit. Clean the vent and the duct carefully with some cleaning solution and then clear out the cleaning solution with water.<\/p>\n<p>Why does it stink when I turn on my AC?<\/p>\n<p>Dust, hair, and moisture on the AC filter encourage mildew growth, which can cause a musty odor when the air conditioner runs. This is a likely reason why the air conditioner smells when first turned on if you don\u2019t use forced-air heating in winter. To help prevent this odor, clean or replace the filter in the spring.<\/p>\n<p>Why does my girlfriend\u2019s feet smell like vinegar?<\/p>\n<p>The smell, however, is not your sweat. It\u2019s a byproduct of the bacteria on your feet consuming your sweat. If your feet smell like vinegar, it\u2019s most likely the result of propionibacteria breaking down your sweat and producing propionic acid, which is similar to acetic acid (vinegar).<\/p>\n<p>Why does my husband smell sour when sleeping?<\/p>\n<p>Body odor at night rarely tops the list of serious health woes, but it can be embarrassing and disconcerting. Sour body odor when sleeping usually isn\u2019t a cause for concern, but the sweating could be a sign of benign hyperhidrosis or a more serious ailment.<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Air conditioners give off a significant amount of condensation, which can eventually turn into mold and mildew if it doesn\u2019t dry completely.
