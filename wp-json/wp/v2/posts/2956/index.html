In the pages within, she shows even more skin wearing a high-waisted bikini. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt feels great,\u201d Musk told The Post on a call Thursday about seeing her cover photos for the first time. \u201cI\u2019ve been modeling for 50 years, and I wasn\u2019t considered a \u2018swimsuit model,\u2019 but now Sports Illustrated has let me know that they have a wide diversity of swimsuit models. I think it\u2019s wonderful.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>She kept news of the shoot under wraps from her three kids, including Elon, who she joked would have broken the news on Twitter. \u201cI wasn\u2019t allowed to tell anyone. Nobody knew. I haven\u2019t told my kids \u2014 I can\u2019t tell anyone until Monday . . . [Elon] doesn\u2019t even know I went to Belize.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"788\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/Maye-Elon.jpg?w=788\" alt=\"Maye and son Elon Musk attended the Met Gala together. \" \/>Maye and son Elon Musk attended the Met Gala together. Matt Baron\/Shutterstock    <\/p>\n<p>It took a little convincing for Musk to put on a bikini, admitting she\u2019s always been \u201cstrictly\u201d a one-piece kind of gal. She said she was sent 100 swimsuits to try on for the shoot, then she settled on a floral, high-waisted Zimmermann two-piece that nearly sent jaws dropping on set.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFortunately, there was no mirror, so I couldn\u2019t see what I looked like, but when I came out of the dressing room, they all went, \u2018whoa,\u2019 \u201d Musk said. \u201cIt\u2019s a high waist, so it tucked me in nicely. I look quite curvy. I just walked around like I\u2019m a teenager.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>While she may have felt sweet 16, Musk hopes her splashy spread will help redefine the conversation around aging and so-called bikini bodies.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think woman of all ages . . . they\u2019re scared of aging, and they\u2019re scared they won\u2019t look good in a swimsuit,\u201d Maye said. \u201cSo now you know that I\u2019m setting an example so women can walk freely in swimsuits and not worry about it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If anything, Musk\u2019s career catapulted with age.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t natural [gray] until my late 50s. I colored it in various shades of blond \u2014 then I was told that probably nobody ever wants to book me, so I said, \u2018Well then, I don\u2019t care about my hair. I don\u2019t have to color [it],\u201d she said of embracing her signature silver mane. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI cut it short ,and it looked fabulous. Then I left the agency that said I\u2019ll never work again, and I got billboards in Times Square and then I got editorials . . . and then campaigns.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Musk has become the poster-woman for aging gracefully, posing nude for Time magazine\u2019s health issue in 2010. At 63, she appeared with a fake pregnant belly and her natural gray hair on the 2011 cover of New York Magazine to portray women over 50 having children. And at 69, she made history as the oldest CoverGirl.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>More recently, she stepped out at the Met Gala with Elon in his first public appearance since news broke that he was buying Twitter.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI had a beautiful Dior dress on and a handsome man on my arm,\u201d she said, laughing. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/Maye-and-Elon.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Maye and Elon musk\" \/>Maye told the Post she loved seeing her son \u201cloosen up\u201d on the carpet at the Met Gala earlier this month. EPA\/\/JUSTIN LANE    <\/p>\n<p>\u201c[Elon initially] didn\u2019t want to walk the red carpet. I said, \u2018You\u2019re going to walk with me because I need somebody to hold on to.\u2019 \u201d She said she loved seeing him loosen up, \u201ceven dancing in a goofy way\u201d for the cameras. \u201cI was so happy to get him away from space and rocket science and Tesla factories,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike Kim Kardashian, who famously dropped 16 pounds to fit into Marilyn Monroe\u2019s iconic gown for the Met Gala, Musk said she made very few changes to her diet leading up to her SI shoot.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t do crazy diets, you lose your energy. When I need to lose weight, I take away my high-fat foods \u2014 no fries, or fried chicken or sauces. I\u2019d cut out dessert, and then I can drop a couple of pounds quite quickly,\u201d Musk said.<\/p>\n<p>After the shoot, which involved Musk standing on a hidden structure in the ocean to make it look like she was walking on water, she celebrated with an indulgent meal. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe last night, we went to the most fabulous restaurant for dinner. I had dessert. I said, \u2018Just order and I\u2019ll have a taste.\u2019 Sweets are my weakness,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/MAYE_MUSK.jpg?w=681\" alt=\"\" width=\"618\" height=\"928\" \/>Musk has kept her silver hair natural since her 50\u2019s and has gotten more modeling jobs ever since.  Annie Wermiel\/NY Post    <\/p>\n<p>Her drink of choice? \u201cI like a rum and Diet Coke or a fruity cocktail \u2014 I like sweet drinks.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>And while her title may be \u201csupermodel,\u201d she\u2019s still a mom first, taking to Twitter to defend her son after the New York Times ran a story suggesting he was \u201cdetached from apartheid\u2019s atrocities\u201d amid his early upbringing in South Africa, which she took issue with.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn South Africa, if you publicly opposed apartheid, you went to jail,\u201d Musk pointed out in a tweet to Tthe Times comparing it to \u201chow today in Russia if you publicly oppose the war, you go to jail.\u201d She asked the publication: \u201cAre you going to blame children for decisions made by governments?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/MAYE_MUSK.2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Maye Musk\" \/>\u201cMy agents are not going to be sleeping for a while,\u201d Musk told the Post of her upcoming book tour following the SI shoot. Annie Wermiel\/NY Post    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cOf course he\u2019s treated unfairly because he\u2019s making big changes,\u201d she said, suggesting that the fossil-fuel industry resents him for popularizing electric cars. <\/p>\n<p>Maye has spoken about her humble beginnings as a single mom at age 31, struggling to provide for her three kids financially. She started modeling in South Africa in the late 1960s and took a job teaching nutrition before starting a dietitian practice of her own in Canada.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>With a new book out, \u201cA Woman Makes a Plan,\u201d she\u2019ll continue to tour, heading to Cannes, France, next for the film festival and on to Korea to speak about her book.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>She said, \u201cMy agents are not going to be sleeping for a while.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Elon Musk isn\u2019t the only one in the family making waves.
