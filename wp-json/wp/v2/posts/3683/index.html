But sleep deprivation isn\u2019t good for your productivity \u2014 or your health. \u201cGive yourself a good night&#8217;s sleep, and take a midday nap if you need to,\u201d Andi advises. \u201cAs a creator, one of the benefits of working for yourself is setting your own schedule, so be gentle with yourself.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Consider your health<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Andi teaches clients to be self-aware and mindful of their bodies, which can be a challenge for busy creators. \u201cAre you drinking enough water? Eating a well-balanced diet? Making time for movement in your day?\u201d Andi asks. \u201cWhen we\u2019re overworking ourselves, we sometimes overlook the simple things that are good for us that make a big impact.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3><b>Schedule time to unplug<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>\u201cTo ensure you\u2019re treating your well-being with the same level of importance as the work you do, you may need to block time on your calendar for reset time, rest time, exercise and healthy eating,\u201d Andi suggests. Make unplugging part of your schedule. \u201cEven if your days feel disorganized and chaotic,\u201d Andi notes, \u201cthere is hope when you work to<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DoKrsvmmpn4\"> manage your time<\/a>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>However you unplug, do it with purpose and do it often! Technology helps creators accomplish so many amazing things. We just need to be sure to unplug enough to care for ourselves and keep those creative juices flowing.<\/p>\n<p><i>For more content creation and lifestyle advice from Oui, We by Andi Eaton, check out her Creator Insights series on the<\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLfVPq9A6B0ROQuEABjK3FXiJXK3siKcId\"> <i>Google for Creators YouTube<\/i><\/a><i> channel.<\/i><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Step away and reset \u201cWhether you spend that time on a hike in nature, in bed resting, in a yoga class, having a nourishing meal with friends, getting your nails done, going&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":3684,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[15],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3683"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3683"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3683\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3683"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3683"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3683"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
