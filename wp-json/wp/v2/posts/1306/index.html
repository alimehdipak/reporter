Gas giants are planets, like our solar system\u2019s largest ones Jupiter and Saturn, composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, with swirling gases surrounding a smaller solid core.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe think it is still very early on in its \u2018birthing\u2019 process,\u201d said astrophysicist Thayne Currie of the Subaru Telescope and the NASA-Ames Research Center, lead author of the study published on Monday in the journal\u00a0Nature Astronomy. \u201cEvidence suggests that this is the earliest stage of formation ever observed for a gas giant.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It is embedded in an expansive disk of gas and dust, bearing the material that forms planets, that surrounds a star called AB Aurigae located 508 light years \u2013 the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km) \u2013 from Earth. This star got a fleeting moment of fame when its image appeared in a scene in the 2021 film \u201cDon\u2019t Look Up.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>About 5,000 planets beyond our solar system, or exoplanets, have been identified. This one, called AB Aur b, is among the largest. It is approaching the maximum size to be classified as a planet rather than a brown dwarf, a body intermediate between planet and star. It is heated by gas and dust falling into it.<\/p>\n<p>Planets in the process of formation \u2013 called protoplanets \u2013 have been observed around only one other star.<\/p>\n<p>Almost all known exoplanets have orbits around their stars within the distance that separates our sun and its most faraway planet Neptune. But this planet orbits three times as far as Neptune from the sun and 93 times Earth\u2019s distance from the sun.<\/p>\n<p>Its birth appears to be following a different process than the standard planetary formation model.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe conventional thinking is that most \u2013 if not all \u2013 planets form by slow accretion of solids onto a rocky core, and that gas giants go through this phase before the solid core is massive enough to start accreting gas,\u201d said astronomer and study co-author Olivier Guyon of the Subaru Telescope and the University of Arizona.<\/p>\n<p>In this scenario, protoplanets embedded in the disk surrounding a young star gradually grow out of dust- to boulder-sized solid objects and, if this core reaches several times Earth\u2019s mass, then begin accumulating gas from the disk.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis process cannot form giant planets at large orbital distance, so this discovery challenges our understanding of planet formation,\u201d Guyon said.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, the researchers believe AB Aur b is forming in a scenario in which the disk around the star cools and gravity causes it to fragment into one or more massive clumps that form into planets.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s more than one way to cook an egg,\u201d Currie said. \u201cAnd apparently there may be more than one way to form a Jupiter-like planet.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The star AB Aurigae is about 2.4 times more massive than our sun and almost 60 times brighter. It is about 2 million years old \u2013 an infant by stellar standards \u2013 compared to about 4.5 billion years for our middle-aged sun. The sun early in its life also was surrounded by a disk that gave rise to Earth and the other planets.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNew astronomical observations continuously challenge our current theories, ultimately improving our understanding of the universe,\u201d Guyon said. \u201cPlanet formation is very complex and messy, with many surprises still ahead.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>WASHINGTON, April 4 \u2013 Scientists have observed an enormous planet about nine times the mass of Jupiter at a remarkably early stage of formation \u2013 describing it as still in the womb&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":1307,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[14],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1306"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1306"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1306\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1306"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1306"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1306"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
