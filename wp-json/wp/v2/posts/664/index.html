And it costs Hemminger heftily, too. Two years ago, he bought a Himalaya-edition Birkin with ultra-rare hand-painted finish \u2014 original retail price $50,000 \u2014\u00a0 from one woman for $100,000.<\/p>\n<p>He then sold it on the site for $150,000. Recently, it cost him $180,000 to buy a similar bag from a different client; he sold that one for $230,000. Fashionphile isn\u2019t too snooty to handle relatively cheaper secondhand treats, too, like a Vuitton cardholder; these cost $250 at the LV store but are regularly out of stock.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/thrifting-1-percent-01.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Rare Birkin bags can go for as much as $230,000 secondhand.

Jackie Onassis was the OG of VIP \u201crecommerce.\u201d When she wed the tight-fisted shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, she spent more than a million bucks on outfits in the first year; he responded by slashing her spending allowance to just $30,000 per month. With no cash, but plenty of cachet, Jackie turned to liquidating her closet on the downlow to help float her shopping habits.<\/p>\n<p>The way it works now is, if there\u2019s a wealthy woman agonizing over whether she should \u2014 or could get away with \u2014 putting a pricey purse on her black AmEx, the sales associate leans in to whisper a suggestion: Perhaps she has an older bag at home she could sell, and then buy this new treat for cash? He could recommend a great place to do that, too.<\/p>\n<p>Retired vintage dealer Lisa Stark, whose business was based in Palm Beach, told The Post that sales associates at Saks would \u201ctell them to bring their bags to me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/ben-hemminger-fashionphile-02.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=682\" alt=\"Ben Hemminger is the founder of upscale reseller Fashionphile.\" \/>Ben Hemminger is the founder of upscale reseller Fashionphile.Courtesy of Ben Hemminger    <\/p>\n<p>When he started out, Hemminger admitted, he would press a few bills into a few sales<br \/>associates\u2019 palms to encourage them to mention that option.
