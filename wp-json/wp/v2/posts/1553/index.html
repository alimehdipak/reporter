He announced on Twitter Friday that he has scheduled a performance this summer in New York City. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cBig news!! I will be performing on July 8 at the Market Hotel in Brooklyn, NY,\u201d he wrote in the tweet, which also noted that \u201cspecial guests\u201d would make appearances. \u201cGet your tickets while you can.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The show was confirmed in a post on the hotel\u2019s Instagram Stories. A link on the ticket site Venue Pilot offers a ticket price is $20 for the 8 p.m. show.<\/p>\n<p>It was unclear whether the July gig would be Hinckley\u2019s first-ever live public performance.<\/p>\n<p>Scenic Presents \u2014 a Brooklyn concert promotion company that is handling the show and also tweeted the news \u2014 declined a request for comment from The Post, which also reached out to the hotel for a statement. <\/p>\n<p>Responses to his announcement included people asking him to book shows in cities including Boston and Chicago and inquiring whether shirts and other merchandise are available \u2014 just like for any other touring artist.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2021\/06\/Hinckley2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"John Hinckley has published a half-dozen videos to a YouTube channel.\" \/>John Hinckley has released dozens of songs on YouTube, iTunes and Spotify.YouTube    <\/p>\n<p>In December 2020, Hinckley, now 66, created a YouTube account in an attempt to jump-start a long-simmering dream of working in the music industry. Since then, he has uploaded more than three dozen videos to the account, which has more than 26,000 subscribers. The clips show him strumming a guitar and singing, with a hint of country twang, both reportedly original material \u2014 including tunes of hope and love with titles like \u201cMay Your Dreams Come True,\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t We Get Along\u201d and \u201cYou and I Are Free\u201d \u2014 and covers of songs from the likes of Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan and Elvis Presley.<\/p>\n<p>Comments have subsequently been turned off for his YouTube channel, but early commenters seemed to be fans from the start. \u201cWhen I heard you were released and making songs on YouTube I thought it was a joke, but far out this was such a beautiful song,\u201d one fan had written. \u201cYou are very talented, please make more.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Hinckley announced last December that he planned to start his own record label, Emporia Records, premiering with a 14-song CD of his music. He also said that interested musicians could submit their own CD or cassette demos to him via a Post Office box in Williamsburg, Virginia.<\/p>\n<p>The Post counted 29 of his own tracks currently available on iTunes, and his songs are also available on Spotify. His latest single, titled \u201cDark Is the Night,\u201d was released to stream on April 1.<\/p>\n<p>Hinckley opened fire on Reagan outside of a Washington, DC, hotel on March 30, 1981 \u2014 striking him once in the chest, as well as hitting three others, including press secretary James Brady, who\u00a0was partially paralyzed\u00a0for the rest of his life. Reagan survived and was hospitalized for two weeks.<\/p>\n<p>Hinckley was fixated with actress Jodie Foster, who starred as a prostitute in the movie \u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d and stalked her in hopes of getting her attention. He ultimately plotted an attempt to kill the president, eerily mirroring an assassination attempt by another character in the film, Travis Buckle, played by Robert De Niro. <\/p>\n<p>Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity and spent 35 years in a psychiatric institution. In 2016, Hinckley\u00a0moved in with his mother\u00a0in Virginia and, two years later, left to\u00a0live on his own.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Maybe he\u2019s looking to land a No. 1 song with a bullet on the record charts.
