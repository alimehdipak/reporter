But then the deeper in they get the higher the stakes become, where there\u2019s that possibility that [the children] might be taken away \u2014 all of which creates a jeopardy but also a space for the humor, warmth and \u2026 the beauty of this show.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/trying-apple-tv-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Esther Smith and Rafe Spall as Nikki and Jason.

At the episode\u2019s end, Jason discovered Tyler hiding in the trunk of his car.<\/p>\n<p>So here we are.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think, for this season, in terms of parenting, their expectations of what they think being a parent is are not necessarily met,\u201d Smith said. \u201cYou can kind of have an idea in your head of what kind of parent you\u2019re going to be and how you\u2019re going to talk to a child, but these children are people in their own right \u2026 and trying to bond with people who\u2019ve already got certain opinions \u2026 I think that\u2019s a tricky place to be for anyone.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s unique about them is that they don\u2019t have the privilege of having raised the kids since they were babies, then they get these two fully formed personalities with wants, needs and desires, all of which developed without the influence of Nikki and Jason,\u201d Spall said. \u201cParenting is hard enough, [but] parenting fully formed little beings presents a different set of challenges.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Jason, meanwhile, is staying home to raise the kids, while Esther, who was promoted to manager at the rental car company, faces the challenges that come with her new position.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/trying-apple-tv-3-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Photo of Eden Togwell and Mike McAnulty as Princess and Tyler.

The longer I\u2019ve done acting I realized the important thing about it is being absolutely comfortable on-screen \u2026 so you want to get that across to the kids.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll do things like, when I\u2019m talking to the young boy playing Tyler, Mickey, even sometimes after they\u2019ve called action I\u2019ll carry on the conversation I was having with him and then I\u2019ll just go into the scene so he doesn\u2019t feel like he needs to make it bigger or do \u2018acting,\u2019 that he can just talk like a normal person would.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Both Smith and Spall said that, as the season progresses, both Nikki and Jason will learn to temper their expectations.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThings never turn out who you want them to in life and I suppose part of being happy is making peace with the disparity between the way you expect things to be and the way things are,\u201d Spall said. \u201cA lot of rich comedy and pathos lives in that space.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Nikki and Jason finally have the children for which they\u2019ve been \u201cTrying\u201d the past two seasons.
