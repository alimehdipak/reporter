It\u2019s likely a little of both.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The number of in-the-wild exploits, also known as \u201czero days\u201d, discovered by researchers more than tripled between 2019 and 2021, according to data from Google\u2019s Project Zero cybersecurity lab.<\/p>\n<p>The dramatic rise in Chrome\u2019s popularity in recent years may partly be to blame, Taylor said, as it makes the browser a more attractive prospect for cyber attacks due to its large base of potential victims.<\/p>\n<p>Also responsible for the rise is the increased complexity of browsers such as Chrome as PCs and smartphones become smarter.<\/p>\n<p>Taylor explained that hackers increasingly need multiple attacks to break through Chrome\u2019s defenses.<\/p>\n<p>This is due to its security team\u2019s decision to separate running programs so that attacks cannot spread between vulnerable parts of the browser.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAn attacker generally now has to use more bugs than they previously did,\u201d Taylor wrote.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor exactly the same level of attacker success, we\u2019d see more in-the-wild bugs reported over time, as we add more layers of defense that the attacker needs to bypass.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For its part, Chrome is accelerating its release cycles to try and slash the time between an exploit\u2019s discovery and its patch launch.<\/p>\n<p>That gap has already dropped from 35 days in Chrome 76 to an average of 18 days today, with plans in place to reduce this further in future.<\/p>\n<p>Users can keep their PCs protected by ensuring they keep their browsers up to date with the latest software releases.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAbove all,\u201d Taylor wrote. \u201cIf Chrome is reminding you to update, please do!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To update Chrome, open the browser and\u00a0click the More icon (three vertical dots) in\u00a0the top right.<\/p>\n<p><em>This story originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google has issued a chilling warning to the 2.6 billion people who use its Chrome web browser.
