Darnold went 4-7 as the starter for the Panthers.<\/p>\n<p>Now they\u2019ve lost out on a trade attempt for Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson after the Panthers were informed Thursday they were out of the running. Since the Atlanta Falcons and New Orleans Saints are the two remaining teams, the Panthers will have to face Watson twice a year in the NFC South. Stay tuned there.<\/p>\n<p>So what now?<\/p>\n<p>The only thing that\u2019s clear is Carolina needs a franchise quarterback to fulfill owner David Tepper\u2019s dream of winning a Super Bowl &#8212; and Darnold isn\u2019t that.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a quarterback who can win on his own, the odds of getting to the big game are long, no matter how good you are in other areas,\u2019\u2019 Hall of Fame general manager Bill Polian said during Carolina\u2019s pursuit of Watson.<\/p>\n<h2>Trade possibilities<\/h2>\n<p>Carolina could pursue a veteran via trade, although none appear to be a long-term solution since Russell Wilson went from Seattle to Denver.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s doubtful the Panthers would pursue San Francisco 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo because he will demand a big salary and is also recovering from shoulder surgery.<img data-src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2021\/1213\/nfl_mcshay-mock-draft_16x9_608x342.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2021\/1213\/nfl_mcshay-mock-draft_16x9_608x342.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Rankings:<\/b> Kiper \u00bb | McShay \u00bb<br \/>\u2022 <b>Mocks:<\/b> Kiper \u00bb | McShay \u00bb | Reid \u00bb<br \/>\u2022 Meet the QBs \u00bb | Intriguing teams \u00bb<br \/>\u2022 Full draft order \u00bb | First Draft podcast \u00bb<br \/>\u2022 <b>More coverage \u00bb | Full rankings \u00bb<\/b><\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>Baker Mayfield &#8212; the top pick of the 2018 draft, two spots ahead of No. 3 pick Darnold &#8212; wants out of Cleveland after the Browns made a run at Watson.<\/p>\n<p>Even if the Browns were willing to trade Mayfield, he would come with an $18.9 million salary cap hit. If not signed to an extension, he would be a free agent again in 2023.<\/p>\n<p>On the plus side, Mayfield wouldn\u2019t cost three first-round draft picks, players and other picks, like it&#8217;s believed the Panthers would have needed to pay for Watson &#8212; a three-time Pro Bowl selection who demanded a traded last offseason before 22 civil suits were filed against him alleging inappropriate behavior and sexual assault. Watson was on the Texans&#8217; roster last season but was inactive on game days.<\/p>\n<p>Carolina could use the money and draft picks saved by not getting Watson, who would have counted $35 million against the cap before a restructure, to build around Mayfield.<\/p>\n<p>Philadelphia\u2019s Gardner Minshew also could be a possibility. The Panthers made a run at him last year. Again, he\u2019d be nothing more than a quick fix and not much of an upgrade.<\/p>\n<h2>Free agency<\/h2>\n<p>Jameis Winston and Ryan Fitzpatrick are available in free agency. Either would be an upgrade from Darnold.<\/p>\n<p>Winston makes the most sense here. He was 5-2 with 14 touchdowns to three interceptions with the New Orleans Saints last season before an ACL tear ended his season.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nfl\/500\/car.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\" \/> What you need to know about the Carolina Panthers:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Panthers&#8217; free-agent signings \u00bb<br \/>\u2022 Tracker: Latest signings and news \u00bb<br \/>\u2022 Free-agency grades \u00bb |  Top 100 FAs \u00bb<br \/>\u2022 Free-agency coverage \u00bb |  More NFL \u00bb<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s just doubtful the Panthers would commit past this season to the 28-year-old, who was the top pick of the 2015 draft by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He has a career record of 33-44, and has thrown 91 interceptions to 135 touchdowns.<\/p>\n<p>Carolina could look at re-signing Cam Newton, who in 2015 led it to a 15-1 regular-season record and the NFC Championship. Just don\u2019t bank on it. He was 0-5 with the Panthers last season and is 13-23 as a starter between Carolina and the New England Patriots the past three years.<\/p>\n<h2>Darnold and a rookie<\/h2>\n<p>Selecting a quarterback with the No. 6 pick to pair with Darnold remains an option, although this year\u2019s class hasn\u2019t gotten rave reviews.<\/p>\n<p>General manager Scott Fitterer is expected to be at Liberty on Tuesday to look at Malik Willis, whose ceiling appears to be the highest among the class, even if he\u2019s not NFL-ready right away.<\/p>\n<p>Fitterer likely will go from there to Pittsburgh to see Kenny Pickett, considered the most NFL ready quarterback, on Wednesday. Remember, Pickett committed to Matt Rhule when the Carolina coach was at Temple.<\/p>\n<p>The Panthers also believe this quarterback class is better than critics say.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think there&#8217;s a good franchise player at six in this draft without identifying who they might be,\u2019\u2019 Fitterer said at the NFL combine.<\/p>\n<p>So there are quarterback options in the draft, including trading down for extra draft picks and still taking one, if the top two offensive tackles are gone at six.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Fitterer will be focused on rebuilding the offensive line and the rest of the roster, particularly the line that allowed 52 sacks a year ago.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>CHARLOTTE, N.C. \u2013 Last offseason, the Carolina Panthers attempted to trade for then-Detroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford and ended up settling for Sam Darnold in a deal with the New York Jets.Stafford went on to win the Super Bowl for the Los Angeles Rams.
