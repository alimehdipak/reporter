After two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, in which gals gave up everything from hair dye to heels, ladies are flocking to TikTok to show off their all-natural approach to grooming, where the hashtag #bodyhairisnatural has more than 91 million views. And the pro-body hair movement is gaining ground offline, too. According to the 2021 YouGov Body Image Study, 35 percent of Americans have no preference if women shave or not, while 7 percent said they should not shave. For respondents between the ages of 18 and 35, female fur proved to be even less of an issue, with a majority confessing that they either find armpit hair attractive or don\u2019t care if a woman has it.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"682\" height=\"1023\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/SydneyJordan_BaileyBullockPhotog.jpeg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=682\" alt=\"Sydney Jordan\" \/>Sydney Jordan refuses to shave her underarms \u201cjust for a couple hundred dollars.\u201d Bailey Bullock    <\/p>\n<p>And while Jordan is getting pushback for her anti-shaving stance, other pinups are being rewarded for daring to be hairy.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPeople never cared if I shaved,\u201d 25-year-old model Elyanna Sanchez, who boasts more than 93,000 followers on Instagram, told The Post. \u201cIt just felt normal [to have body hair].\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The model, who splits her time between Los Angeles and Manhattan, appeared in a 2019 underwear ad for Calvin Klein that prominently features her fluffy underarms. Sanchez said she didn\u2019t shave that day because she \u201cdidn\u2019t really think about it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While the client had no problem with her au naturel look, Sanchez said commenters online weren\u2019t so kind, which she sees as hypocritical. \u201cPeople say, \u2018Can you use real models?\u2019\u201d she said of the pressure fashion companies get to hire more typical-looking people. \u201cAnd then everyone bashes them and calls them ugly.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"834\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/Elyanna1.jpeg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=834\" alt=\"Elyanna Sanchez\" \/>Elyanna Sanchez proudly flaunts her fuzz, and won\u2019t even shave if she has a big shoot.Courtesy of Elyanna Sanchez    <\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, brands are increasingly taking big risks on body hair.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>UK-based razor brand Sunny writes in their tagline, \u201cTo shave or not to shave, it\u2019s no biggie is it?
