Since it warned in January of weak\u00a0subscriber\u00a0growth, the company has lost nearly half of its value.<\/p>\n<p>The lagging\u00a0subscriber\u00a0growth prompted\u00a0Netflix\u00a0for the first time to say it might\u00a0offer\u00a0lower-priced version of the service with\u00a0advertising.<\/p>\n<p>The company said it lost 200,000\u00a0subscribers in its first quarter, falling well short of its forecast of\u00a0adding 2.5 million\u00a0subscribers.

Wall Street targeted 227 million for the second quarter, according to Refinitiv data.<\/p>\n<p>In\u00a0addition to\u00a0advertising-supported\u00a0plans, the company is also looking to generate\u00a0additional revenue from customers who share their account with friends or family outside their home.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThose who have followed\u00a0Netflix\u00a0know that I\u2019ve been against the complexity of\u00a0advertising, and a big fan of the simplicity of subscription,\u201d said CEO Reed Hastings. \u201cBut, as much as I\u2019m a fan of that, I\u2019m a bigger fan of consumer choice.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Hastings said \u201cit\u2019s pretty clear\u201d that\u00a0ad-supported\u00a0services are working for Disney and HBO.<\/p>\n<h2>Confluence of events<\/h2>\n<p>Netflix\u2019s first-quarter revenue grew 10% to $7.87 billion, slightly below Wall Street\u2019s forecasts. It reported per-share net earnings of $3.53, beating the Wall Street consensus of $2.89.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe large number of households sharing accounts \u2014 combined with competition, is creating revenue growth headwinds. The big COVID boost to streaming obscured the picture until recently,\u201d\u00a0Netflix\u00a0said, explaining the difficulties of signing up new customers.<\/p>\n<p>In\u00a0addition to the paying households,\u00a0Netflix\u00a0is being watched by an\u00a0additional 100 million households that it said were sharing accounts, including 30 million in the United States and Canada. As penetration has increased, the number of shared accounts has become a bigger problem.<\/p>\n<p>This confluence of events caught Wall Street by surprise.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/reed-hastings.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"CEO Reed Hastings\" \/>Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said \u201cit\u2019s pretty clear\u201d that\u00a0ad-supported\u00a0services are working for Disney and HBO.Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey suffered from a combination of approaching saturation, inflation, higher pricing, the war in Ukraine and competition,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us expected that all to happen at once.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The world\u2019s dominant streaming service was expected to report slowing growth, amid intense competition from established rivals like Amazon, traditional media companies such as the Walt Disney and the newly formed Warner Bros Discovery and cash-flush newcomers like Apple Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Streaming services spent $50 billion on new content last year, in a bid to attract or retain\u00a0subscribers, according to researcher Ampere Analysis. That\u2019s a 50% increase from 2019, when many of the newer streaming services launched, signaling the quick escalation of the so-called \u201cstreaming wars.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Netflix\u00a0noted that despite the intensifying competition, its share of TV viewing in the United States has held steady according to Nielsen, a mark of\u00a0subscriber\u00a0satisfaction and retention.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/netflix-earnings.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Netflix website\" \/>\u201cThe large number of households sharing accounts \u2014 combined with competition, is creating revenue growth headwinds,\u201d Netflix said.Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe want to grow that share faster,\u201d the company said.<\/p>\n<p>As growth slows in mature markets like the United States,\u00a0Netflix\u00a0is increasingly focused on other parts of the world and investing in local-language content.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhile hundreds of millions of homes pay for\u00a0Netflix, well over half of the world\u2019s broadband homes don\u2019t yet \u2014 representing huge future growth potential,\u201d the company said in a statement.<\/p>\n<p>Benchmark analyst Matthew Harrigan warned that the uncertain global economy \u201cis apt to emerge as an albatross\u201d for member growth and\u00a0Netflix\u2019s ability to continue raising prices as competition intensifies.<\/p>\n<p>Streaming services are not the only form of entertainment vying for consumers\u2019 time.
