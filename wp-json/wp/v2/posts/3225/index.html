Julianne Hough\u2019s blond hair and bright smile are glistening in Greenwich Village, just a short walk from the Washington Square Park area where she is living her New York dream. No doubt, she is soaking up the sun in this manifested moment.<\/p>\n<p>Before she even made her Broadway debut in the new political farce \u201cPOTUS: Or, Behind Every Great Dumbass Are Seven Women Trying to Keep Him Alive,\u201d the 33-year-old dancer, actress, singer and entrepreneur was already choreographing a Big Apple move.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBack in October, I remember calling my manager. I was like, \u2018OK, I want to immerse myself in what\u2019s happening in Broadway, because they\u2019ve obviously had the hardest time through the pandemic,\u2019\u201d says Hough over a <em>salade ni\u00e7oise<\/em> and <em>pommes frites<\/em> at Petite Boucherie. \u201cI was like, \u2018Keep an eye out to see if anything\u2019s happening. But I think I just need to put myself in proximity, so maybe I\u2019ll just move there in March.\u2019 Then, in February, I get this script out of nowhere, and it was an offer for the role. So I very much put it out there, manifested it, not really knowing what it was going to be \u2014 just that I wanted to be here.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/julianne-hough3-kurt-iswarienko.jpg?w=683\" alt=\"Sweater, $950, blue shorts (under layer), $690, and green shorts, $790, similar styles at AnOnlyChild.com; Mach &amp; Mach heels, $1,100 at ModaOperandi.com; Constraint Collection pearl necklace, $340, and gem bracelet, $660, both at 51E-John.com; Pav\u00e9 huggie earrings, $78 at AdinasJewels.com \" \/>Sweater, $950, blue shorts (under layer), $690, and green shorts, $790, similar styles at An Only Child; Mach &amp; Mach heels, $1,100 at Moda Operandi; Constraint Collection pearl necklace, $340, and gem bracelet, $660, both at 51E John; Pav\u00e9 huggie earrings, $78 at Adinas JewelsPhotos by Kurt Iswarienko    <\/p>\n<p>After her big break on \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d in 2007 led to movies such as \u201cFootloose\u201d and \u201cRock of Ages,\u201d judging stints on both \u201cDWTS\u201d and \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent,\u201d and even a country album, Hough is now exactly where she wants to be \u2014 just a few months after her divorce from former hockey star Brooks Laich was finalized in February. It\u2019s not lost on Hough that she is embracing her new life as both part of the Broadway community and the queer community, just steps from the birthplace of LGBTQ rights at Stonewall. \u201cIt\u2019s a new beginning,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>In this next chapter, Hough shares the stage at the Shubert Theatre with an all-female cast, including Vanessa Williams, Lea DeLaria and \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d alum Rachel Dratch in a play that, set in the White House, takes satirical aim at the patriarchy.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/julianne-hough4-kurt-iswarienko.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Dress, $4,990 at Oscar de la Renta, 772 Madison Ave.; \u201cTequila\u201d sandals, $1,350 at Aquazzura.com; Tiffany &amp; Co. \u201cT1\u201d 18-k gold bangle with diamonds, $22,000 at Tiffany, 610 Fifth Ave.; \u201cGemma\u201d earrings, $45 at MazinJewels.com; \u201cTriple Leaf\u201d  ring, $1,280, similar styles at KBHJewels.com\" \/>Dress, $4,990 at Oscar de la Renta, 772 Madison Ave.; \u201cTequila\u201d sandals, $1,350 at Aquazzura; Tiffany &amp; Co.
