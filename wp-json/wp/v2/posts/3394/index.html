The complementary DNA strand, the one that is not used, is called the nonsense or antisense strand.<\/p>\n<p>What is a sense and antisense gene?<\/p>\n<p>A sense-antisense (SAS) gene pair is defined as two genes that reside on opposite genomic strands within the same locus and share exonic sequence overlap. Until recently, the genome was thought to be organized into discrete transcriptional units (TUs).<\/p>\n<p>Which strand is the sense strand?<\/p>\n<p>In genetics, a sense strand, or coding strand, is the segment within double-stranded DNA that carries the translatable code in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction, and which is complementary to the antisense strand of DNA, or template strand, which does not carry the translatable code in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction.<\/p>\n<p>Why is it called the sense strand?<\/p>\n<p>The DNA sense strand is called a \u201csense\u201d strand not because it will be used to make protein (it won\u2019t be), but because it has a sequence that corresponds directly to the RNA codon sequence. By this logic, the RNA transcript itself is sometimes described as \u201csense\u201d.<\/p>\n<h3>What is antisense strand called?<\/h3>\n<p>Coding strand is same as mRNA except that thymine in DNA is replaced by Uracil in RNA. The coding strand contains codons. Antisense strand: This strand is also called as non-coding strand, minus strand or template strand. This strand acts as template for the synthesis of mRNA.<\/p>\n<p>Is the lagging strand the antisense strand?<\/p>\n<p>Leading and lagging strands come into play during DNA replication. antisense strand is the strand complementary to the mrna sequence for a specific protein. leading strand is the strand that is replicated at one go, unlike the lagging strand, which is replicated in okazaki fragments.<\/p>\n<p>Which strand is used for transcription?<\/p>\n<p>DNA is double-stranded, but only one strand serves as a template for transcription at any given time. This template strand is called the noncoding strand. The nontemplate strand is referred to as the coding strand because its sequence will be the same as that of the new RNA molecule.<\/p>\n<p>What is plus and minus strand DNA?<\/p>\n<p>in a single-stranded DNA virus, a plus strand is one contained in the virus particle or any strand having the same base sequence. A minus strand has a base sequence complementary to the plus strand; mRNA can be transcribed from the minus strand.<\/p>\n<h3>Is the coding strand the antisense strand?<\/h3>\n<p>Wherever a gene exists on a DNA molecule, one strand is the coding strand (or sense strand), and the other is the noncoding strand (also called the antisense strand, anticoding strand, template strand or transcribed strand).<\/p>\n<p>What is coding and noncoding strand?<\/p>\n<p>The coding strand is the DNA strand whose base sequence is similar to its primary transcript (RNA). This strand contains codons, while the non-coding strand contains anticodons. The coding strand serves as a template for producing complementary RNA.<\/p>\n<p>What is forward strand?<\/p>\n<p>For the forward strand, this means reading left-to-right, and for the reverse strand it means right-to-left. A gene can live on a DNA strand in one of two orientations. The gene is said to have a coding strand (also known as its sense strand), and a template strand (also known as its antisense strand).<\/p>\n<p>Which is the lagging strand of DNA?<\/p>\n<p>The lagging strand is a single DNA strand that, during DNA replication, is replicated in the 5\u2032 \u2013 3\u2032 direction (opposite direction to the replication fork). DNA is added to the lagging strand in discontinuous chunks called \u2018okazaki fragments\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>What is the function of antisense RNA?<\/p>\n<p>Antisense RNA molecule represents a unique type of DNA transcript that comprises 19\u201323 nucleotides and is complementary to mRNA. Antisense RNAs play the crucial role in regulating gene expression at multiple levels, such as at replication, transcription, and translation.<\/p>\n<h3>How RNA polymerase recognize the sense strand?<\/h3>\n<p>A typical bacterial promoter contains two important DNA sequences, the 10 and 35 elements. RNA polymerase recognizes and binds directly to these sequences. The sequences position the polymerase in the right spot to start transcribing a target gene, and they also make sure it\u2019s pointing in the right direction.<\/p>\n<p>What is the function of the coding strand?<\/p>\n<p>During transcription, the coding strand of DNA serves as a template for synthesis of a complementary RNA molecule. The sequence of the RNA molecule is determined by complementary-base pairing so that the RNA is a complementary transcript (copy) of the coding strand of DNA.<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The main difference between sense and antisense strand is that sense strand is incapable of being transcribed into mRNA whereas antisense strand serves as the template for the transcription.
