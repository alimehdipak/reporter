offered to step in after Bay-area Google employees, who are scheduled to return to the office beginning on April 4 \u2014 reportedly raised a stink over the company\u2019s plans to remove heated bidet toilets from the office premises.<\/p>\n<p>The tech giant started removing the Toto-branded toilet seats because they were in violation of California\u2019s code for commercial buildings,\u00a0according to Protocol, which reportedly saw a maintenance ticket ordering the removals.<\/p>\n<p>Company staffers took to the internal meme generator to complain about the new policy, with one worker noting: \u201cThe removal of bidets in the office is my #2 issue with RTO,\u201d referring to returning to the office.<\/p>\n<p>Edgar Tovar, who handles maintenance at company facilities, told staffers that the bidet removal \u201chas the added benefit of supporting Google\u2019s water sustainability commitments.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMany of our buildings are migrating to recycled water systems which cannot support bidets,\u201d he wrote.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"968\"

response, Tushy founder Miki Agrawal wrote a letter to Google management offering to ship portable bidets to its Bay Area office.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to be a hands-on Googler if one

bidets removed.Twitter    <\/p>\n<p>Bidet toilets are specially outfitted so that those who need to go to the bathroom can have a stream of water strategically aimed at the relevant areas.<\/p>\n<p>In the old days, especially in Europe, bidets were placed alongside traditional toilets as an option to maintain hygiene.<\/p>\n<p>The word \u201cbidet\u201d is French for \u201cpony\u201d or \u201csmall horse\u201d \u2014 which is appropriate since the use of a bidet requires one to straddle it as if riding a four-legged animal.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\"

Middle East, and Asia, but they have not caught on as much in the United States, where toilet paper is typically the sole method of cleaning one\u2019s backside.<\/p>\n<p>Proponents of bidets argue that it would be beneficial for the environment since it would save trees that are needed to be cut down in order to produce toilet paper.<\/p>\n<p>In the early days of the coronavirus pandemic,\u00a0sales of bidets skyrocketed\u00a0as shoppers started panic-buying toilet paper.<\/p>\n<p>Google employees will be required to return\u00a0to the company\u2019s offices for at least three days of in-person work per week starting on April 4, the company said earlier this month.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google employees upset over the company\u2019s
