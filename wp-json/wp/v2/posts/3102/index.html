Artisan Entertainment\/ Courtesy: Everett Collection    <\/p>\n<p>The director\u2019s vague niceties sound alarmingly familiar in this sad era of tech gone loco. When actor Peter Cushing was electronically exhumed to play Grand Moff Tarkin in \u201cRogue One: A Star Wars Story\u201d \u2014 looking like a sullen Gumby \u2014 the visual effects supervisor told the Guardian, \u201cthis work was done with a great deal of affection and care.\u201d What a crock.<\/p>\n<p>A few years later when the \u201cStar Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker\u201d team awkwardly wedged in archival footage of the late Carrie Fisher in a totally new context, plopped in a forest, J.J. Abrams told The Post, \u201cI think if she had lived, and you were to sort of squint your eyes, it would be the same movie.\u201d No way, J.J.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re lectured over and over again by these dystopian funeral directors that, in turning deceased stars into 2003 screensavers, we\u2019re in fact honoring their legacies. That the doofy doppelg\u00e4ngers are lasting monuments that the actors probably, maybe, kinda would have approved of. No, cynics, Hollywood isn\u2019t making a quick buck off long-gone celebs\u2019 names and likeness at all! <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/1395406806.jpg?w=683\" \/>Grey, now 62, will return as Baby in the sequel to \u201cDirty Dancing.\u201dGetty Images    <\/p>\n<p>One can only marvel at Tinseltown\u2019s proud soullessness. Even James Dean, who died in 1955 at age 24, is said to be headed back to the big screen in the new movie \u201cFinding Jack\u201d thanks to sophisticated new animation techniques. (Dean replaces Elvis Presley, whose estate wisely said no to the stunt.) Just what Dean dreamed of as he was studying at the Actors Studio during a time when talking 3D holograms were practically witchcraft \u2014 being a bucket \u2018o pixels and an algorithm.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s still early enough for Lionsgate (whose god-awful flops \u201cMoonfall\u201d and \u201cChaos Walking\u201d inspire as much confidence as a century-old rope bridge over a canyon) to pick a route that doesn\u2019t make viewers want to bury their heads in their popcorn: a couple of flashback scenes from the 1987 flick paired with a whole new young couple. (The best choice would be to make no sequel at all, but fat chance. It\u2019s one of the studio\u2019s most lucrative properties.) Grey said she\u2019d love to get Harry Styles for the movie. Fine!<\/p>\n<p>All I know is that if Hollywood turns the wonderful, gone-too-soon Swayze into the T-Rex from \u201cJurassic World,\u201d I will not have the time of my life.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We all know the famous movie quote: \u201cNobody puts Baby in a corner with a CGI replica of the late Patrick Swayze.\u201d OK, that\u2019s not the exact phrase, but it is nonetheless&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":3103,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[5],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3102"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/6"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3102"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3102\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3102"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3102"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3102"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
