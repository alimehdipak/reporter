But this isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve worked in NYC.<\/h2>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/pietro-scaglione-paris-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Interior of an apartment in Paris Pinto designed. \" \/>Pinto gave this stylish but traditional apartment in Paris a colorful make over. \u00a9Giorgio Baroni    <\/p>\n<p>Alberto was very attracted to the city and even lived there in the late \u201960s. At the time, he moved into an apartment that he decorated with a very modern and graphic inspiration. This is how he began to constitute a very important American clientele.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Pinto has since created interior designs all over the US and in New York where we developed several corporate buildings for the late real estate developer Howard Ronson, townhouses, penthouses on Fifth Avenue as well as the renovation and transformation of the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais into a private residence. <\/p>\n<p>As a matter of fact, the inspiration for the last apartment where Alberto lived in Paris on 61 Quai d\u2019Orsay was that chic and spacious Park Avenue apartment feel.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2>What\u2019s Pinto\u2019s specialty?<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s custom design. In fact, it is a very haute couture fashion approach to interior design. The d\u00e9cors are built around the personalities of each of our clients. We are able to bring their interior design dreams to life, and to put it more simply, to make them happy.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2>You\u2019ve designed yachts and planes for the world\u2019s most demanding people. What are some of the most outrageous requests you\u2019ve fulfilled?<\/h2>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/pietro-scaglione-2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Side by side of Scaglione and a private jet he designed. \" \/>Scaglione (left) designs everything from swish NYC condos to private jets (right).Pinto    <\/p>\n<p>The requests for planes don\u2019t tend to be over the top because they\u2019re functional more than entertainment spaces. We did have a client with a Boeing 747-8 \u2014 one of the biggest in the world for private jets \u2014 who wanted a circular entry hall with a semicircular glass door leading to the two master bedrooms and private areas such as the family room and office. The space is huge like a house. There are even two bathrooms \u2014 one for the owner and other for his wife. The design has lots of wood and leather with touches of Art Deco. I can\u2019t say what it cost but it was well over a million euros.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThe d\u00e9cors are built around the personalities of each of our clients. We are able to bring their interior design dreams to life, and to put it more simply, to make them happy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Pietro Scaglione<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>And we did have to install an aeration system in a kitchen of a private jet to allow the chef to use a wok despite the smoke it generates.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Yacht requests are far more outrageous because this is where people spend their leisure time and host friends. We have clients who want big swimming pools, massage rooms and discos. <\/p>\n<p>One wanted a billiards table which was complicated because you\u2019re at sea, so you have to maintain the balance of the table. We needed a hydraulic cylinder to do it. Our yacht projects bring in design elements such as marble, embroidery, bronze, glass and other materials you would have in a high-end house.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>We also had an unusual request for a client\u2019s parking lot. He wanted it to transform into a nightclub with removable panels and hidden elements in the walls!<\/p>\n<h2>Tell us about your work at the Wales, which we know is your newest New York project.\u00a0<\/h2>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/re-wales-3.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Exterior of the Wales.\" \/>A rare condo conversion comes to conservative Carnegie Hill.Stefano Giovannini    <\/p>\n<p>The Wales has had several lives. Most recently as Hotel Wales, a beloved hotel in the heart of Carnegie Hill. Our desire was to respect and pay homage to the building\u2019s rich history and ensure the design aesthetic blends in beautifully with the neighborhood.\u00a0We worked on a simple d\u00e9cor, light colors and modern classical style<\/p>\n<h2>What projects are you currently working on?\u00a0<\/h2>\n<p>A private club called Beat in London dedicated to electronic music, a restaurant Zytia in Ibiza and two corporate offices in Paris. Along with these \u201cpublic\u201d projects we are working on several private residences, yachts and jets in Europe, in the US and in the Middle East, which, of course, are confidential.<\/p>\n<h2>What are your most memorable projects?<\/h2>\n<p>First off, there are Alberto\u2019s personal homes and apartments: the garden floor at Charles Floquet with its Azulejos hall, 73\u00a0quai d\u2019Orsay, which was very \u201cGrand,\u201d and his sublime vacation home Dar El Quas in Tangier.<\/p>\n<p>The Alfa Nero yacht is memorable for its very recognizable shape, with its never-before-seen decks organized in amphitheaters and its pool in the back shaped as a boat.<\/p>\n<p>There is also, of course, Fahad Hariri\u2019s Parisian apartment and his residence in Marrakech, both clearly the homes of an art collector and with a strong identity exemplifying the freshness he breathes into Pinto\u2019s artistic creation today.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When their superyacht, private jet or presidential palace needs a zhuzh, the world\u2019s richest call Pinto.
