I hate them so much.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He went on to show close-ups of several of the dolls, many of which had their eyes seemingly gouged out or otherwise missing, only to be replaced with rocks, barnacles and other debris. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cLook at this one,\u201d Oliver said about a doll covered in green \u201cwar\u201d paint. \u201cLook at these blank eyes.

One doll head \u2014 with its mouth wide open \u2014 sold for $35 at the auction. Quickly deemed it a sex doll, Oliver demanded, \u201cThat sex doll head and whoever bought it needs to be thrown directly into the middle of the ocean!\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Oliver hypothesized several ways to get rid of the dolls \u2014 \u201cbreak some kind of a curse \u2026 or a special volcano we can throw them into\u201d \u2014 before pledging to take care of the spookiness himself. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/creepy-dolls-texas-beaches-john-oliver-feat-image.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"But, really: Can you blame John Oliver for freaking out over the beach dolls?\" \/>But, really: Can you blame John Oliver for freaking out over the beach dolls?YouTube \/ LastWeekTonight    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/creepy-dolls-texas-beaches-john-oliver-09.jpeg?w=1024\" alt=\"John Oliver freaks out over creepy dolls that have been washing up on Texas beaches\" \/>At the end of his rant, John Oliver offered a solution that could prevent the dolls from haunting Texas beachgoers again.
