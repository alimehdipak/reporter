Moms do a lot of the heavy lifting and I think every mother deserves to be recognized. It\u2019s very important to make them feel honored and appreciated.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/london-jewelers-band.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"London Jewelers 18-k rose-gold ring with blue topaz, $2,385\" \/>London Collection 18-k rose-gold ring with blue topaz, $2,385    <\/p>\n<p>\u00a0But snaring the perfect gift requires a bit of research, Udell notes, including assessing what the recipient already has in her collection. \u201cA lot of women want to start with the basics before they get into other add-ons.\u201d She suggests beginning with diamond studs, a tennis necklace or bracelet. \u201cThese are such an important part of the jewelry wardrobe and many women aspire to have them \u2014 they should be a go-to.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/london-jewelers-green-earrings-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"London Collection 18-k white-gold earrings with diamonds and emeralds, $231,000\" \/>London Collection 18-k white-gold earrings with diamonds and emeralds, $231,000    <\/p>\n<p>Moving on, classics like yellow gold and diamonds are trending across the board. \u201cIt\u2019s become really stylish because people are wanting a more casual look for wearing jewelry every day,\u201d says Udell. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>After that, personalized charms with engraved initials or children\u2019s names spelled out in diamonds are surefire hits packed with meaning. Loving symbols such as hearts are also \u201cvery big this year\u201d for gifting, she notes.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/london-jewelers-link-choker.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"London Collection 18-k yellow-gold necklace with diamonds, $110,000\" \/>London Collection 18-k yellow-gold necklace with diamonds, $110,000    <\/p>\n<p>Once the basics are set, let the layering begin. Udell says the possibilities are endless with London\u2019s signature \u201carm parties\u201d (stacks of different styles of bracelets), \u201cneck messes\u201d (staggered necklaces of varied lengths to be worn together), and \u201cear parties\u201d (constellations of sparklers worn on lobes and cartilage). \u201cPeople like to dress their ears, and these days, they have a lot of different piercings, which they\u2019re filling with studs and hoops in yellow and white gold as well as diamonds,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/london-jewelers-hearts-band-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"London Collection 18-k rose-gold ring with diamond and pink sapphires, $15,855\" \/>London Collection 18-k rose-gold ring with diamond and pink sapphires, $15,855    <\/p>\n<p>And with spring and summer arriving, moms are embracing jewels in a rainbow of hues. Udell suggests wowing them with statement-makers, like single color, emerald-cut bands in luscious shades (think: blue topaz, green tsavorite and pink and yellow sapphires) or a double-width pink-sapphire ring embedded with a glittering white-diamond heart. \u201cIt\u2019s just so pretty and a little different.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/london-jewelers-tennis-bracelet.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"London Collection platinum bracelet with diamonds, $47,950\" \/>London Collection platinum bracelet with diamonds, $47,950    <\/p>\n<p>As for those who have all of these bases covered? Udell points to precious pieces that are \u201cnot so well-branded or well-known \u2014 something distinctive that shows individuality, [like] wearable art.\u201d To this end, London offers a broad selection of choices such as opal baubles surrounded by sapphires or aquamarines and \u201cfresh and hip\u201d treasures in black titanium. She adds that blingy, dressier pieces \u2014 including eye-catching strands of diamonds in unusual shapes \u2014 are in demand for those reentering a world of weddings and graduations.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/london-jewelers-hoop-earrings.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"London Collection   18-k yellow-gold earrings with diamonds, $14,070\" \/>London Collection 18-k yellow-gold earrings with diamonds, $14,070    <\/p>\n<p>Still stumped? \u201cWe are very good at designing here as well,\u201d she notes. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making some really impressive things \u2014 stunning pieces tailored to fit your personality.

(Her husband Mark\u2019s grandfather, Charles London, founded London Jewelers in 1926 and the business is still run by multiple generations of the family.) She says heritage gifts like these go far beyond the material.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/london-jewelers-ring.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"London Collection platinum ring with opal, aquamarines, diamonds and pink sapphires, $26,500\" \/>London Collection platinum ring with opal, aquamarines, diamonds and pink sapphires, $26,500    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI truly believe when you receive a piece of jewelry that has been passed down from someone you love, you can feel their heart beat.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>London Jewelers\u2019 flagship is located in Long Island\u2019s Manhasset, with additional stores in Southampton, East Hampton, Glen Cove, Wheatley Plaza in Greenvale and downtown Manhattan.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>London Jewelers\u2019 VP Zach Udell shares Mother\u2019s Day picks from the retailer\u2019s watch salon<\/h2>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/london-jewelers-ap-watch-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Selfwinding white-gold watch with diamonds, $29,100\" \/>Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Selfwinding white-gold watch with diamonds, $29,100    <\/p>\n<p>For moms of steel<br \/>\u201cThis just-launched model has generated amazing interest and feedback.
