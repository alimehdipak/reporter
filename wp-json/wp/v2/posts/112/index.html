According to Hastings Law Journal, NDAs were so much a part of the culture that when a departing employee refused to sign one, Balwani summoned the police. To explain the crime being committed, he insisted that the employee \u201cstole property in his mind.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>But Balwani failed to work his dark magic with employee Tyler Shultz, the grandson of George Shultz, a former secretary of state and a board member of Theranos. In early 2014, Tyler became an initial whistle-blower at the firm, reporting to New York State Department of Health regulators that the blood testing machine was a sham.<\/p>\n<p>Soon after, he told CBS News, Balwani responded aggressively.

They did finger tests, took blood and put it into the fake machines. Then, while the VIPs were on the tour, the blood would be put into a legitimate machine [from an outside manufacturer]. Theranos staffers came back with accurate results that were purported to have come from the Edison.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But, the source believes, Balwani\u2019s alleged misdeeds were not purely out of cold-hearted malice.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSunny is a smart guy.
