It can lead to tooth loss and bone decay. If you suspect you have gum disease, you should seek treatment immediately. Learn how to know if you have gum disease in this post.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Common Signs of Gum Disease<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gum disease affects people in their 30s or 40s, and it\u2019s more common among men. Teenagers may get gingivitis but don&#8217;t usually develop periodontitis.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Bleeding gums<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s important to visit your <a href=\"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/view\/kbizz\/pearl-shine\">dentist<\/a> if you notice bleeding gums. The dentist will be able to tell if the bleeding is caused by gum disease or some other problem. Your dentist can also help you to avoid further damage to your gums. The best way to treat bleeding gums is to clean them properly and see if you can find the source of the bleeding. If you are not sure where the bleeding is coming from, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/d\/u\/0\/edit?hl=en&amp;mid=11m_1tp24u_LavEUelRgfDCfuWPgJuonf\">ask your dentist<\/a> to show you. He or she can help you to find the cause of the problem. Bleeding gums are not a sign of a serious illness. However, they can cause discomfort, which is why it is important to pay attention to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Swollen gums<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swollen gums are frequently an early sign of gum disease. Healthy gums should be firm and pink, while swollen gums tend to be puffy and red.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Constant bad breath<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you suffer from bad breath, it may be because there is a plaque in your mouth that creates a gas that smells unpleasant.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Receding gums<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The gum recession should not be taken lightly. Gum recession can be a symptom of periodontitis; the inflammatory disease that wears away the tissue supporting the teeth and exposes part of it or even the tooth&#8217;s root.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Over-sensitive teeth<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have tooth sensitivity, it may be a sign that your gums are receding because of gum disease. The soft, inner layer of the tooth (dentin) becomes unprotected because of the loss of enamel.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Loose teeth or tooth loss<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes, a tooth may become loose because of an infection that is below the gum line. As the problem worsens, the gum pockets can get deeper due to bacteria attacking your gum tissue and bone. Periodontitis is one of the major contributors to tooth loss. Other signs of periodontitis are pus between your gums and teeth, sores in your mouth, and a change in how your teeth fit together when you bite.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Gum disease is a very serious and painful condition that affects your teeth and gums.
