I felt his arms and hands wrapped around my legs making contact with my inner thigh, butt and crotch,\u201d she wrote as part of a statement she submitted to Hillsong in 2018 informing them of the incident, the Christian Post previously reported.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In response to her coming forward, the church defended Mays and shamed Crenshaw, making her feel at fault for bringing up the issue, according to the Australian report. Crenshaw and her father, pastor Ed Crenshaw, went to the police five months later and in 2020, Mays pleaded guilty to \u201cassault with an act of indecency\u201d in a local court.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Hillsong continued defending him, though, releasing a statement stating that other witnesses\u2019 recollections of the gathering \u201cdid not fully corroborate (Ms. Crenshaw\u2019s) version of the events.\u201d Onstage, former church head Brian Houston once said of Mays, \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a young man, a young married man who did something stupid, got much drunker than he should, which is an issue we\u2019ve got to keep \u00adaddressing, and got himself in a bad situation,\u201d the Australian reported.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI can only say that I\u2019m proud of Anna for standing up for what is right and for continuing to do what she can to hold Hillsong Church accountable for their poor handling of their victims,\u201d Ed Crenshaw told The Post of his daughter\u2019s new lawsuit. \u201cThe need for her to do so is obvious given Hillsong leadership\u2019s pattern of covering up improper behavior, including that of Brian Houston.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Hillsong did not return The Post\u2019s request for comment.<\/p>\n<p>The new lawsuit follows Houston\u2019s resignation from the church he founded earlier this year. The 68-year-old cited the ongoing trial accusing him of failing to turn over evidence of his father\u2019s pedophilia, as well as misconduct allegations as the reasons for his resignation.<\/p>\n<p>Houston stepping down, and now the lawsuit, mark the most recent blows to the once celebrity-beloved multinational megachurch, which has spent the past two years enmeshed in various scandals since the firing of Justin Bieber\u2019s former pastor, Carl Lentz.\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A former Hillsong megachurch student is suing the Australia-based institution after she was sexually assaulted by one of its employees.\u00a0 The action was brought this week in the Australian state of New&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":3519,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[5],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3518"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/6"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3518"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3518\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3518"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3518"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3518"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
