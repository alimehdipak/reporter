AP    <\/p>\n<p>This is far from the first time factories making Apple products have been accused of maintaining brutal working conditions. <\/p>\n<p>In December, 159 women working at an iPhone production plant in India were hospitalized for food poisoning, sparking a rare worker protest. <\/p>\n<p>A subsequent Reuters investigation revealed that workers at the factory had to survive off worm-infested food while living in rat-filled dorms without running water. Workers said they were forced to sleep on the floor in dormitories, with up to 30 women sleeping in a single room. At least one of the dorms had toilets with no running water, the workers said.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The women making iPhones \u2014 many which retail for more than $1,000 \u2014 were paid roughly $4.67 per day and were forced to reimburse a contractor for housing and food while working at the plant, according to the report.   <\/p>\n<p>After the report was published, Apple put the Foxconn-run facility \u201con probation\u201d and said it will not be reopened until it meets its \u201cstrict standards.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Factory workers at a Shanghai facility that makes Apple products rioted on Thursday, clashing with guards in hazmat suits and jumping across security barriers in an apparent mutiny against strict coronavirus restrictions,&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":2611,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[14],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2610"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2610"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2610\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2610"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2610"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2610"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
