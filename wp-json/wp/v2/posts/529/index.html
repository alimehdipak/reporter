It is an inhibitor of what\u2019s known as acetylcholinesterase.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhenever you do anything muscle-related, your neurons use acetylcholinesterase as a signal to basically say \u201cgo move your muscles.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe way VX is lethal is it actually stops your diaphragm, your lung muscles, from being able to move so your lungs become paralyzed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He went on to explain that his team took the data usually given to AI to see if something is toxic and changed how the AI processed it.<\/p>\n<p>Urbina told The Verge: \u201cWe weren\u2019t really sure what we were going to get. Our generative models are fairly new technologies.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo we haven\u2019t widely used them a lot.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/fabio-urbina.jpeg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Fabio Urbina, the lead author of the paper published in Nature Machine Intelligence.\" \/>Fabio Urbina, the lead author of the paper published in Nature Machine Intelligence.Courtesy of @fabio-urbina    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe biggest thing that jumped out at first was that a lot of the generated compounds were predicted to be actually more toxic than VX.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the reason that\u2019s surprising is because VX is basically one of the most potent compounds known. Meaning you need a very, very, very little amount of it to be lethal.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The scientists were mostly shocked about how easy they found the experiment was to conduct.<\/p>\n<p>A lot of data they used could be found online for free.<\/p>\n<p>The researchers were even in two minds about publishing their study in case it encouraged bad actors to copy it.<\/p>\n<p>Urbina explained: \u201cThe dataset they used on the AI could be downloaded for free and they worry that all it takes is some coding knowledge to turn a good AI into a chemical weapon-making machine.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt the end of the day, we decided that we kind of want to get ahead of this. Because if it\u2019s possible for us to do it, it\u2019s likely that some adversarial agent somewhere is maybe already thinking about it or in the future is going to think about it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>This article originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission. <\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Artificial intelligence was used to \u2018easily\u2019 invent 40,000 new possible chemical weapons in just six hours.
