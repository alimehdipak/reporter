Even if they didn\u2019t treat me well, I would ignore it and only focus on the good parts because I was committed to that person,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then we broke up, and I was trying really hard to, like, be friends with him.

My mom was like, \u2018No! You cannot do that!\u2019 But with \u2018abc,\u2019 I honestly \u2026 wasn\u2019t particularly thinking about that song.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While she started out singing country music, Gayle\u2019s childhood hero was the Queen of Soul. \u201cThe person who inspired me to do music in the first place was Aretha Franklin,\u201d she said. \u201cI [discovered] her when I was around 7, and I just got hooked. I mean, I just loved her soul.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Later, Gayle discovered female rockers such as Joan Jett and Courtney Love, but it was another influential woman \u2014 hit-making songwriter and former \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d judge  Kara DioGuardi \u2014 who would prove instrumental in her development.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI would not be the writer I am without her,\u201d said Gayle. \u201cShe has mentored me and my songwriting, and really inspired me to dig deeper and be more vulnerable in my songs and really fight for my artistry \u2026 It was really great to have a powerful, badass woman helping me and inspiring me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/GAYLE-2-.-Acacia-Evans.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=682\" alt=\"Gayle\" \/>Gayle has been mentored by hit-making songwriter \u2014 and former \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d judge \u2014 Kara DioGuardi.Credit:Acacia Evans    <\/p>\n<p>Now Gayle is part of a wave of young female artists, including Billie Eilish and Olivia Rodrigo, who are being open about everything from mental health to sex \u2014 a topic she addresses on new single \u201cur just horny.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s just the reality of teenagers,\u201d she said. \u201cTo acknowledge it helps people feel less alone.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And Gayle \u2014 who graduated from high school in 2020 \u2014 doesn\u2019t care about possibly being a bad influence on some children\u00a0with \u201cabcdefu.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI ain\u2019t worried,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll probably have a very cynical laugh if the kindergartners of the world are singing \u2018A-B-C-D-E-F-U\u2019 instead of the \u2018ABCs.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On her viral hit \u201cabcdefu,\u201d 17-year-old TikTok sensation Gayle launches an F-bomb tirade against a shady ex: \u201cF\u2014k you and your friends that I\u2019ll never see again\/Everybody but your dog, you can&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":166,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[5],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/165"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/6"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=165"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/165\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=165"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=165"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=165"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
