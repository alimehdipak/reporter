Like a child in my body. It didn\u2019t hurt or anything,\u201d he said of his doctor\u2019s discovery. <\/p>\n<p>He began a cocktail of medications for chemotherapy \u2014 and the results seemed to be promising. But in January 2021, the chemo had weakened his immune system and the star got COVID before the vaccine was available. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/jeff-bridges-Susan-Geston-02.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Susan Geston and Jeff Bridges arrive to the 76th Annual Golden Globe Awards held at the Beverly Hilton Hotel\" \/>Bridges\u2019 wife Susan Geston was concerned that he was going to die while in the ICU.
