Knowing that her son with Musk was out with his father, he asked about the sounds.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not at liberty to speak on these things,\u201d Grimes, who at 33 is 17 years younger than Musk, told the magazine at first. \u201cWhatever is going on with family stuff, I just feel like kids need to stay out of it,\u201d she said, though she did eventually confirm there was a new baby: \u201cShe\u2019s a little colicky too.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/grimes-met-gala.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Grimes at the Met Gala last year.\" \/>Grimes at the Met Gala last yearTaylor Hill    <\/p>\n<p>Of course, the second offspring of the richest man in the world couldn\u2019t have a basic moniker. Grimes, born Claire Boucher, said Y\u2019s first name is based on the supercomputing term exaFLOPS, which refers to exascale computing with high\u00a0floating point operations per second. Translation: something that can perform 1 quintillion things per second. Her first middle name, Dark, Grimes told the magazine, refers to \u201cthe unknown. People fear it but truly it\u2019s the absence of photons. Dark matter is the beautiful mystery of our universe.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>And Sider\u00e6l, she said, is \u201ca more elven\u201d way to spell sidereal, an astrological term, as well as an homage to her favorite \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d character, Galadriel. It\u2019s a name with the potential to annoy or confuse everyone on the internet. When Musk confirmed big brother X\u2019s birth name in May 2020, X \u00c6 A-12, critics questioned whether they gave birth to a human or a USB cable.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Despite having split up in September 2021, Grimes confirmed that she and Musk are amicably co-parenting as \u201csynthesized companions.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/elon-grimes.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"The couple heading to dinner in May 2021 in New York City.\" \/>The couple heads to dinner in May 2021 in New York City.Gotham    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we\u2019re very fluid.

Grimes says her latest album, \u201cBook 1,\u201d is inspired by Musk\u2019s theory that she\u2019s a \u201csimulation.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe keep having this conversation where E\u2019s like, \u2018Are you real?

However, Grimes reportedly moved back to Austin full time in December, around the birth of their daughter, though she has her own residence.<\/p>\n<p>Musk suggested Grimes was a little too messy for his liking, telling Vanity Fair in an interview from his Tesla that he likes things \u201creasonably neat.\u201d They also have differing tastes in aesthetics.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/elon-musk-son.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Elon Musk and son X \u00c6 A-12 on stage TIME Person of the Year on December 13, 2021 in New York City. \" \/>Musk and his son X \u00c6 A-12 onstage at a Time magazine Person of the Year event on Dec. 13, 2021, in New York CityTheo Wargo    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI just don\u2019t like things to be messy and anime,\u201d Musk told the magazine.<\/p>\n<p>He also maintains that he might one day be parenting from a long distance away.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been saying since before she was pregnant that I was going to Mars,\u201d Musk told Vanity Fair.<\/p>\n<p>Still, the musician said she and Musk want to have \u201cat least three or four\u201d more children.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/elon-musk-snl-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" \/>Musk hosted \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in May 2021.NBC    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/grimes-snl.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Grimes also appeared in a sketch.\" \/>Grimes also appeared in a sketch.NBC    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/VF_April_2022_Grimes_Cover.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=819\" alt=\"Grimes on the latest cover of Vanity Fair in which she revealed she had a second child with Musk.\" \/>Grimes on the latest cover of Vanity Fair, in which she revealed she had a second child with Musk.Steven Klein\/Vanity Fair    <\/p>\n<p>In the article, Grimes reveals that she\u2019s uncomfortable with her newfound wealth as Musk\u2019s co-parent, acknowledging that there was a time when she \u201cused to be so far left,\u201d referring to her political stance.
