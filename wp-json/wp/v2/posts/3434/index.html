Afferent arteriole is a branch of the renal artery that brings in blood to the glomerulus. Efferent arteriole is a branch of the renal artery that drains blood away from the glomerulus. Afferent arteriole carries blood to the glomerulus.<\/p>\n<h3>What is the function of the efferent arteriole?<\/h3>\n<p>The efferent arterioles form a convergence of the capillaries of the glomerulus, and carry blood away from the glomerulus that has already been filtered. They play an important role in maintaining the glomerular filtration rate despite fluctuations in blood pressure.<\/p>\n<p>What is the difference between afferent and efferent vessels?<\/p>\n<p>Afferent is used to describe things like nerves, blood vessels, and arteries that lead toward or bring things (like blood, in the case of arteries) to an organ, such as the heart or brain. Efferent means the opposite\u2014it\u2019s used to describe parts that carry or lead things away from organs or other parts.<\/p>\n<p>What is the role of afferent and efferent arteriole of glomerular filtration?<\/p>\n<p>1. The afferent and efferent arterioles constrict in response to \u03b1-adrenergic stimulation. This vasoconstriction predominantly affects the afferent arteriole, effectively reducing hydrostatic pressure within the glomerular capillary lumen and decreasing glomerular filtration.<\/p>\n<p>What is the difference between artery and vein?<\/p>\n<p>Arteries carry blood away from the heart, and veins carry blood towards the heart. With the exception of pulmonary blood vessels, arteries carry oxygenated blood and veins carry deoxygenated blood. Arteries have thick walls with muscle tissue. Veins have thinner walls and use valves to keep your blood flowing.<\/p>\n<h3>Why is the efferent arteriole narrower?<\/h3>\n<p>Because it has a smaller diameter than the afferent arteriole, it creates some resistance to blood flow, producing the back-up of blood in the glomerulus which creates higher pressure in the glomerular cavity.<\/p>\n<p>Do afferent arterioles carry oxygenated blood?<\/p>\n<p>Afferent arterioleEfferent arterioleIt brings oxygenated blood into the kidney.It carries deoxygenated blood away from the kidney.It is formed by the branching of the renal artery.It is formed by the fusing of glomerular capillaries.<\/p>\n<p>What afferent means?<\/p>\n<p>Definition of afferent<\/p>\n<p>(Entry 1 of 2) : bearing or conducting inward specifically : conveying impulses toward the central nervous system \u2014 compare efferent.<\/p>\n<p>What receives blood from the efferent arteriole?<\/p>\n<p>Efferent arterioles supply the blood for the extensive network of capillaries that surround the cortical and medullary tubular system of the kidneys, known as the peritubular capillary network.<\/p>\n<h3>How do you remember afferent and efferent?<\/h3>\n<p>Explanation: A good way to remember afferent vs. efferent neurons is: Afferent Arrives, Efferent Exits. Afferent neurons are neurons whose axons travel towards (or bringing information to) a central point, while an efferent neuron is a cell that sends an axon (or carries information) away from a central point.<\/p>\n<p>Which arteriole has more diameter?<\/p>\n<p>Hint: The afferent arteriole is the arteriole that brings blood to the glomerulus. It is larger in diameter than the efferent arteriole.<\/p>\n<p>How does efferent arteriole affect GFR?<\/p>\n<p>During efferent arteriole constriction, GFR is increased, but RPF is decreased, resulting in increased filtration fraction. During a state of increased plasma protein concentration such as during multiple myeloma, GFR is decreased with no change in RPF, resulting in decreased FF.<\/p>\n<p>What is vasa recta in kidney?<\/p>\n<p>In the blood supply of the kidney, the vasa recta renis (or straight arteries of kidney, or straight arterioles of kidney) form a series of straight capillaries in the medulla. They lie parallel to the loop of Henle.<\/p>\n<p>What is the function of glomerulus?<\/p>\n<p>The main function of the glomerulus is to filter plasma to produce glomerular filtrate, which passes down the length of the nephron tubule to form urine.<\/p>\n<h3>Why is the vein blue?<\/h3>\n<p>Veins appear blue because blue light is reflected back to our eyes.  Blue light does not penetrate human tissue as deeply as red light does. As a result, veins that are close to the surface of the skin will be more likely to reflect blue light back to the eye.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>What is the largest artery in the body?<\/p>\n<p>How large is the aorta? The aorta is the largest blood vessel in your body. It\u2019s more than 1 foot long and an inch in diameter at its widest point.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s the main artery called?<\/p>\n<p>The largest artery is the aorta, the main high-pressure pipeline connected to the heart\u2019s left ventricle. The aorta branches into a network of smaller arteries that extend throughout the body. The arteries\u2019 smaller branches are called arterioles and capillaries.<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Difference between the efferent arteriole and afferent arteriole.
