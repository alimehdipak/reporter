However, cleaning your teeth every day at home is only a part of a good oral hygiene routine. Having a &#8220;<em>full dental exam<\/em>&#8221; helps your dentist look for more significant problems, such as oral cancer, gum disease, or other oral issues that we only see when it&#8217;s in severe condition.
