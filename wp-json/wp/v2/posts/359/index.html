Since its introduction at salons, the complete system line is now available for at-home use and comes in eight different products designed to work together to repair hair that\u2019s been damaged by bleach.<\/p>\n<p>Olaplex credits their patented ingredient bis-aminopropyl diglycol dimaleate, which they say is the key to turning dry, weak strands into plump locks.<\/p>\n<p>So, it came as a shock to the hair-obsessed that Olaplex would be revealed as an infertility risk \u2014 not due to its revolutionary compound but a simple fragrance additive called butylphenyl methylpropional, or simply lilial.<\/p>\n<p>It was first revealed when health officials in the European Union, as well as the United Kingdom, announced a ban on one ingredient found within Olaplex product, its No. 3 Hair Perfector mask, pointing to research that shows lilial could lead to infertility. The product is arguably their most popular in the line \u2014 evidenced by the more than 30 million views tied to the social media hashtag #olaplexno3 on TikTok alone.<\/p>\n<p>The news went viral on the video mashup platform as beauty influencers reported said findings, such as TikToker Hasini Kay who cited the UK\u2019s legislative web engine as her source.<\/p>\n<p>According to Kay, \u201csome sources say it\u2019s already being reformulated,\u201d she told followers. \u201cIf not, they\u2019re likely to reformulate before the ban comes into effect.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And indeed, according to the brand, they\u2019ve done exactly that.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn September 2020, the EU regulatory authority announced their intent to Butylphenyl methylpropional commonly referred to as \u2018lillial\u2019 phased out by March of 2022. At Olaplex, lilial was previously used in small amounts as a fragrance in No. 3 Hair Perfector. It is not an active or functional ingredient,\u201d Olaplex told The Post in a statement. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhile this phase out is limited to the EU, out of an abundance of caution, Olaplex proactively removed lillial from our No.3 Hair Perfector globally. Since January 2022, Olaplex no longer sold products using Lillial in the UK or EU,\u201d they continued.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCosmetic experts at The Cosmetic Regulator have clarified that lilial is usually present in formulations at a concentration of 0.1 per cent or less and \u2018is not enough to directly impact fertility\u2019,\u201d they added. \u201cOlaplex previously used 0.0119% as a fragrance and as an inactive and non-functional ingredient in OLAPLEX No. 3 rinse out product.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Olaplex\u2019s chief scientist Lavinia Popescu also appeared on Instagram this week to explain the controversy. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe decided to take lilial out from our products \u2014 not only in the EU, where in this moment it\u2019s banished. We decided to take it out globally,\u201d she concluded. \u201cIn this moment, Olaplex, it\u2019s lilial free.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Studies of lilial have indicated that it may cause adverse effects when ingested by animals \u2014 meaning there are no such studies that can definitely say how it affects humans who rub it on their heads. Moreover, the ingredient has been on the EU\u2019s restriction list for a number of years, though only now is the ban taking effect.<\/p>\n<p>Some on social media, including LA cosmetic chemist Javon Ford, have already pointed out that lilial doesn\u2019t currently appear on the ingredients list, according to the website INCIdecoder. Prior to 2018, however, the ingredient had shown on No. 3\u2019s label, according to the internet archive Wayback Machine.<\/p>\n<p>Ford\u2019s findings suggest that Olaplex has already reformulated to \u201cget ahead of the EU ban and phase out the ingredient.\u201d Added Ford: \u201cIf Olaplex is working for you without issue, no, you do not have to discontinue use.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Olaplex is a staple at trendy upscale salons, but hair-raising rumors that a now-banned ingredient causes infertility have racked up 30 million views on TikTok.
