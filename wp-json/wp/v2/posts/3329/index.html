There are more options for high-level exposure for players than ever before through the investment of shoe-sponsored programs and the independent club circuit. The competition is fierce and there are plenty of key matchups.<\/p>\n<p>We have attended events, filtered through film and debated which players should be ranked where as we updated and expanded the rankings for the women&#8217;s basketball recruits in the Classes of 2023, 2024 and 2025.<\/p>\n<p>The 2023 class expands from the espnW 60 to the espnW 100, while the 2024 class goes from the espnW 25 to the espnW 60. As for the 2025 class, this will be the first time ranking the top prospects, as opposed to the Watch List.<\/p>\n<p>We have identified several prospects who climbed the rankings by taking their games to new levels over the past few months.<\/p>\n<h2>Class of 2023<\/h2>\n<p>PG Hannah Hidalgo<br \/>5-foot-6<br \/>Paul VI (New  Jersey)<br \/>No. 18 to No. 5<\/p>\n<p>Hidalgo has improved in all areas of the game and now brings a methodical presence to the floor. She has always been ultrafast with a strong intensity. However, now she is picking and choosing her spots of when to attack and be aggressive better than before.<\/p>\n<p>She puts an incredible amount of ball pressure on her opponent and she is fantastic about getting into the passing lanes for steals. Offensively, her biggest improvement is her consistency from 3-point range. She has simplified her stroke and shoots a jump shot all the way out to behind the arc. Couple that with her ability to play off the bounce with shiftiness and a sharp handle, and she is one tough matchup.<\/p>\n<p>Schools with interest &#8212; and teams from every major conference have expressed it &#8212; will be able to watch Hidalgo on the Nike EYBL circuit this summer with Philly Rise.<\/p>\n<p>P Aalyah Del Rosario<br \/>6-foot-6<br \/>The Webb School (Bell Buckle, Tennessee)<br \/>No. 13 to No. 8<\/p>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p>Del Rosario transferred to The Webb School in Tennessee for her high school season. Now playing against a national-caliber schedule, she has come out of that experience a very refined and improved player, and her entire game has matured.<\/p>\n<p>She has stepped up her physicality in the lane, defensively and on the boards. Her activity level and motor have improved as well. She has a court awareness that is unique for a post player.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of her skills, she has increased her repertoire in her back-to-the-basket moves. She is using her right and left hands around the rim very well and she can stretch the defense to the top of the key. She is even starting to face up and play off the dribble from the mid- and high-post areas. She is staking a claim as the best big in her class. She will play on the Select 40 circuit this summer with New Heights.<\/p>\n<p>Del Rosario&#8217;s recruitment will narrow soon, but currently includes North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, LSU, Texas, Arizona, NC State, Texas A&amp;M, Duke, Miami and Auburn.<\/p>\n<h2>Class of 2024<\/h2>\n<p>P Kate Koval<br \/>6-foot-5<br \/>Long Island Lutheran (New York)<br \/>Unranked to No. 21<\/p>\n<p>Koval has created quite the buzz among recruiters from high school play and now into club basketball. As size is a premium, skilled size is highly sought after &#8212; so much so that she already boasts offers from Tennessee, South Carolina, Oregon, Louisville, Ohio State, Vanderbilt, NC State, Miami and Maryland.<\/p>\n<p>She knows her game &#8212; physical and on the block. She has a feel that allows her to play against double teams, whether she passes to the open teammate or takes advantage of her strengths for an easy bucket inside.<\/p>\n<p>Koval has decent mobility and is comfortable away from the paint when she needs to be. She keeps things simple, and as she continues to get more experience in a faster pace, watch for her to continue to blossom. She plays for Exodus (New York) on the Nike EYBL circuit.<\/p>\n<p>G Morgan Cheli<br \/>6-foot-2<br \/>Archbishop Mitty (California)<br \/>Unranked to No. 28<\/p>\n<p>Cheli&#8217;s versatility is unparalleled compared to others in her class. She has forward size with guard-like skills and can attack from the wing, get a post-up or play minutes as a lead guard.<\/p>\n<p>She is a very fundamental player who plays for very successful programs in Archbishop Mitty and the Cal Stars. Her skills range from the elevation on her pull-up jumper to creating space to get off her 3-point shot. She is a good passer and rebounds well, which allows her to lead the break right off the glass at times.<\/p>\n<p>She has elements of the Hull twins (Stanford) and Vivian Gray (Texas Tech) in her game. Her recruitment has really taken off this spring and includes schools from every major conference.<\/p>\n<h2>Class of 2025<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/womens-college-basketball\/story\/_\/id\/33970883\/\" \/>Jasmine Davidson is the No. 1-ranked women&#8217;s basketball recruit in the Class of 2025.\u00a0Brittany Graham<\/p>\n<p>G\/W Jasmine Davidson<br \/>6-foot-1<br \/>Clackamas High School (Oregon)<br \/>No. 1<\/p>\n<p>G\/W Dee Alexander<br \/>6-foot-1<br \/>Purcell Marion High School (Ohio)<br \/>No. 2<\/p>\n<p>This was hard to decide who to debut at No. 1 in the 2025 class. It came down to two candidates: Davidson and Alexander. Ultimately, Davidson&#8217;s perimeter shooting gave her the slight edge.<\/p>\n<p>Alexander is a physical guard\/wing who also can play the lead guard spot. She carries herself with a confidence and maturity that is beyond her years. She is good off the dribble and finishes well in the paint with contact. As she improves her shooting consistency, look for this to be an ongoing battle for the top spot. She&#8217;ll play for the West Virginia Thunder on the Under Armour circuit this summer. She has offers from every major conference and the majority of the top 25 programs.<\/p>\n<p>Davidson has a savviness and poise to her floor game that is quite unique for such a young player. She is extremely efficient and plays within the flow of the motion offense so well. The ball never sticks when she has it &#8212; she is ready to decide whether she should attack or move the ball. She has shown the ability to pull up all the way out to the 2-point line off the dribble as well as post up.<\/p>\n<p>She also understands the game so well without the ball in her hands, both offensively and defensively. As we continue, she needs to become more comfortable with the ball in her right hand, as well as her left. That said, right now, she lands at the No. 1 spot in the 2025 class heading into the summer, when she&#8217;ll play with Northwest Select on the Select 40 circuit. She has seen her recruitment on the rise this spring and has offers from every major conference.<\/p>\n<p>PG Lanie Grant<br \/>5-foot-9<br \/>James River High School (Virginia)<br \/>No. 21<br \/>Committed to North Carolina<\/p>\n<p>Grant committed to Courtney Banghart and North Carolina in November, and it&#8217;s easy to see why: She is ultraskilled and already has emerged as one of the better guards in the country.<\/p>\n<p>She is so poised with the ball in her hands as she weaves through opposing defenses that it almost looks easy. She has a smooth jumper and range on her 3-ball. Grant is crafty off the dribble and can create lanes to attach the rim, and she can finish in a variety of ways.<\/p>\n<p>Defensively, she is savvy and knows how to position herself well off the ball. She uses her length well to give herself an effective cushion on the ball and challenge shots. She also plays in the West Virginia Thunder program.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We are coming off an unprecedented girls&#8217; high school basketball season in terms of national competition and scheduling.
