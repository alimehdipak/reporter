Through motivational resources, events and content, Saya aims to connect people and help them live more productive and fulfilling lives. Her two favorite Black creators are interior designer <a href=\"https:\/\/carmeonhamilton.com\/\">Carmeon Hamilton<\/a> and side-hustle mentor <a href=\"https:\/\/techbizgurl.com\/\">Jessica L. Williams<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><i>I came for her bold, non-cookie cutter interior design and her representation of color (decor and skin) in a field devoid of it, I stayed due to her glimpses into her life and lifestyle aesthetic. [On her website, you\u2019ll find] home improvement inspiration but also how vulnerability and transparency exhibit strength and elevate others, how to create and communicate boundaries, how to celebrate success and self, and how to be a friend, parent and spouse. I knew she was a keeper when she mentioned that she too cooks with time-saving frozen veggies \u2014 there ain&#8217;t no shame in that.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>Jessica helps people who like working 9 to 5, but who also crave a side hustle. She provides resources, insight and encouragement that lets people know it&#8217;s ok to entrepreneur part-time, and that work-life balance is attainable. Her newsletter is one of the few I allow and enjoy seeing in my inbox; it&#8217;s the perfect blend of musing and links. I appreciate Jess&#8217; humanness as she lets us know she&#8217;s still trying to figure life out along with the rest of us, and she&#8217;s hands-down the best cheerleader you could have.<\/i><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Saya Hillman Saya Hillman is the head cheese behind Mac &#038; Cheese Productions\u2120 , a company she founded by making lists.
