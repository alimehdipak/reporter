Stephens won the 2017 U.S. Open and was the runner-up at Roland Garros the next year. But she hasn&#8217;t been a member of the final eight players at any major tournament since losing in the quarterfinals in Paris three years ago.<\/p>\n<p>The other quarterfinal on the bottom half of the draw will be a meeting between left-handers: No. 17 Leylah Fernandez, a 19-year-old Canadian who reached the final at last year&#8217;s US Open, against 59th-ranked Martina Trevisan of Italy, who also got to the quarterfinals in Paris two years ago.<\/p>\n<p>Fernandez compiled more than twice as many winners, 35, as unforced errors, 17, and broke serve a half-dozen times to beat 20-year-old American Amanda Anisimova 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 on a chilly, windy day. Trevisan grabbed the last four games and eliminated Aliaksandra Sasnovich 7-6 (10), 7-5.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Every time I step out on the court, I still have something to prove,&#8221; said Fernandez, who was ranked only 73rd last September when she beat four-time major champion Naomi Osaka on the way to being the runner-up to Emma Raducanu at Flushing Meadows. &#8220;I still have that mindset I&#8217;m the underdog. I&#8217;m still young.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Gauff, of course, is even younger.<\/p>\n<p>In 2021, she was the youngest French Open quarterfinalist in 15 years, but frittered away five set points in the opener of a loss to eventual champion Barbora Krejcikova.<\/p>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p>That stuck with her Sunday, when she was in a back-and-forth first set against Mertens that was 4-all before Gauff got going. Afterward, she praised herself for staying calm in the moment.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That was the biggest lesson I learned last year in my quarterfinal match. I had a couple set points, and I think I freaked out when some of those points didn&#8217;t go my way,&#8221; said Gauff, who delivered one around-the-net-post backhand on the run but ultimately lost that exchange. &#8220;Today, I didn&#8217;t freak out when a couple of those important points didn&#8217;t go my way.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Gauff burst onto the scene at Wimbledon in 2019 when she was 15 by becoming the youngest &#8212; yes, there&#8217;s that word again &#8212; qualifier in tournament history, beating Venus Williams in the first round of the main draw and getting all the way to the fourth. Other Week 2 runs at major tournaments have followed.<\/p>\n<p>She is proud of her success with schoolwork. She posted a series of pictures on Instagram of herself wearing her cap and gown and holding a diploma, the Eiffel Tower in the background.<\/p>\n<p>A response from Obama, whom Gauff has met, was a nice surprise.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m super thankful for that message. &#8230; What really meant a lot: It wasn&#8217;t about the tennis, it was about my education,&#8221; Gauff said. &#8220;So I think that meant more to me.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Quite a trip to Paris in the springtime for 18-year-old American Coco Gauff: She celebrated graduating from high school &#8212; an achievement saluted via social media by former first lady Michelle Obama &#8212; and now is into the French Open quarterfinals for the second consecutive year.How did YOU spend the past week or so?Learning as&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":3370,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[13],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3369"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3369"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3369\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3369"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3369"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3369"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
