The ceremony will take place during the 150th anniversary celebration of The Open.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I always said St. Andrews looked like an old gray town until the Open came around,&#8221; Nicklaus said. &#8220;All of a sudden, it just lit up like a light, and it was beautiful. And St. Andrews the week of the Open Championship is always beautiful. I imagine actually probably from anybody who makes a pilgrimage here to play this golf course feels that way.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Nicklaus didn&#8217;t plan to play in Monday&#8217;s Celebration of Champions with other former winners, including Tiger Woods and Lee Trevino. Nicklaus said he didn&#8217;t even bring his clubs to Scotland.<\/p>\n<p>Nicklaus also weighed on the ongoing battle between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf, a new circuit being financed by Saudi Arabia&#8217;s Public Investment Fund. It has lured several high-profile players, including Dustin Johnson, Bryson DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka, away from the PGA Tour with guaranteed signing bonuses of more than $100 million and $25 million purses.<\/p>\n<p>LIV Golf CEO Greg Norman, a two-time Open winner, wasn&#8217;t invited to participate in the Celebration of Champions or attend the champions&#8217; dinner. In a statement, the R&amp;A said it didn&#8217;t invite Norman because it wanted to avoid distractions during the week.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;First of all, Greg Norman is an icon in the game of golf,&#8221; Nicklaus said. &#8220;He&#8217;s a great player. We&#8217;ve been friends for a long time, and regardless of what happens, he&#8217;s going to remain a friend. Unfortunately, he and I just don&#8217;t see eye to eye in what&#8217;s going on. I&#8217;ll basically leave it at that.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>ST.
