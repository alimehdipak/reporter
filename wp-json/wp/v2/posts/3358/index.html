But as the threat from the virus recedes, some including Cartier and Harry Winston continue to impose the new policy.<\/p>\n<p>They also have failed to convince shoppers and experts alike of their reasoning \u2014 if they bother to explain themselves at all. Major brands including Louis Vuitton, Chanel and Cartier didn\u2019t respond to calls and emails from The Post about their persistent use of stanchions in front of store entrances, where queued-up shoppers are quizzed by \u201cgreeters\u201d about prospective purchases before entering. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/lines-14-Chanel-line.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Customers waiting in line to enter a Chanel store.\" \/>Chanel said it will open \u201cprivate\u201d stores for its top customers next year.Bloomberg via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe recommend booking an appointment prior to your boutique visit, as walk-ins may experience extended wait times,\u201d Cartier\u2019s website advises, without elaborating. <\/p>\n<p>According to experts, roped-off customers can mostly thank a relentless epidemic of smash-and-grab robberies rather than social distancing for ramped-up crowd controls nationwide, including in New York, Chicago, Miami, San Francisco and Seattle. Theft got so bad last year that Beverly Hills hired two private security firms to patrol Rodeo Drive. <\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, at the Westchester Mall in White Plains, NY, where robbers ransacked a Louis Vuitton store in February, the boutique\u2019s doors were closed, with stanchions inviting shoppers to queue up outside.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/lines-17-line-with-greeters-and-guard.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"A luxury boutique entrance with greeters and a guard.\" \/>Some luxury boutiques question customers before they enter the store, asking what they are looking for.Jeffrey Greenberg\/UCG\/Universal    <\/p>\n<p>A pair of greeters wearing headsets \u2014 flanked by a pair of beefy mall security guards \u2014 asked customers whether they were there to pick up an order or to shop.

Chanel is hiring 3,500 new employees for the initiative, which experts say could be adopted in the US.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur biggest preoccupation is to protect our customers and in particular our pre-existing customers,\u201d Chanel\u2019s chief financial officer Philippe Blondiaux told Business of Fashion. \u201cWe\u2019re going to invest in very protected boutiques to service clients in a very exclusive way.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In response, fashion blogHighsnobiety questioned \u201cWhat, exactly, do Blondiaux and Chanel want to \u2018protect\u2019 its customers from?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Holland speculated that Chanel may be looking to keep its wealthy clients from becoming targets for thieves after they leave stores. But big spenders also aren\u2019t typically walking in off the street, she adds.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPeople who want to spend $25,000 for a small dress don\u2019t want to stand in line,\u201d Holland said. \u201cThose customers are probably making an appointment with their personal shopper \u2014 they know that line isn\u2019t meant for them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/lines-13-Louis-Vuitton-line-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"A line outside a Louis Vuitton store.\" \/>Some luxury stores are still requiring customers to make an appointment to shop.Bloomberg via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>As previously reported by The Post, Madison Avenue boutiques on the Upper East Side in Manhattan including Chanel, Prada and Carolina Herrera are dimming their lights, locking their doors, and opening by appointment only in a bid to deter a wave of brazen daytime shoplifters that have terrorized the glitzy thoroughfare this year. <\/p>\n<p>In February, a team of seven thieves strolled out of The Real Real on Madison at 71st Street\u00a0with nearly $500,000\u00a0worth of handbags and jewelry.<\/p>\n<p>In the wake of such heists, there is simply a \u201cnew lack of trust\u201d on the part of retailers \u201cabout who is walking through their doors,\u201d said Susan Scafidi, founder and director of the Fashion Law Institute at Fordham Law School.<\/p>\n<p>In practice, most luxury brands assign a sales associate to each customer or group. The days of walking into an exclusive boutique and \u201cbrowsing\u201d without an associate shadowing you are largely over, said one sales rep.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, staffers at upscale boutiques including Chanel, Gucci and Burberry are being armed with talking points for inquisitive customers, some of which sound plausible.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are still dealing with shipping delays from Paris and you don\u2019t want everyone to come in and to notice that the store doesn\u2019t have the latest styles,\u201d a sales associate at a boutique operated by a major luxury label told The Post, speaking on the condition of anonymity. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou want to be able to tell them one-on-one that the pieces are on the way,\u201d the associate added.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>COVID-19 is waning, but shopping for a Louis Vuitton bag, a Chanel suit or a pair of Gucci loafers increasingly means standing in line outside a boutique \u2014 and luxury brands have&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":3359,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[7],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3358"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3358"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3358\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":7255,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3358\/revisions\/7255"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3358"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3358"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3358"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
