It follows Joyce (Ophelia Lovibond), an earnest Vassar-educated feminist who\u2019s trying to launch a women\u2019s magazine called \u201cThe Matriarchy Awakens,\u201d which has more substance than the typical beauty and housekeeping tips. Unfortunately, when she tries to get funding, nobody is interested \u2013 except for friendly and mildly sleazy publisher Doug (Johnson), who has been successful in publishing pornographic magazines. Doug agrees to be Joyce\u2019s publisher and to give her an office and a staff \u2014 as long as Joyce gives her idea a sexier angle and changes the magazine\u2019s name to \u201cMinx.\u201d Together, the unlikely duo team up to create the first women\u2019s erotic magazine.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/jake-johnson-ophelia-lovibond-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Jake Johnson leans into Ophelia Lovibond, smiling and handing her a card. \" \/>Jake Johnson as Doug and Ophelia Lovibond as Joyce in \u201cMinx.\u201d HBO Max    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like the show is a lesson. It feels like it\u2019s entertainment that\u2019s about stuff, and the characters are rich and three dimensional. And, there\u2019s a penis montage in the pilot, which I wanted to see how they were going to pull off,\u201d said Johnson, best known for \u201cNew Girl,\u201d and \u201cSpider Man: Into the Spider-Verse.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Johnson said that series creator Ellen Rapoport sent him a documentary about the making of Playgirl, which helped him prepare for the role. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cShe said, \u2018This is kind of the feeling of it.\u2019 So that was the research I did, and she sent me a bunch of Playgirls from the \u201970s. I think that, in 2022, we are very desensitized; there\u2019s been a porn explosion on the Internet,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, it was really fun when the idea of a nude magazine with men was so risque and people had no idea what to think about it. I thought [the show] is just really funny take on it.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/105-Ophelia-Lovibond-Lennon-Parham-Jessica-Lowe-Oscar-Montoya-Idara-Victor-Jake-Johnson.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" \/>Doug (Jake Johnson) stands in the \u201cMinx\u201d office surrounded by staffers. HBO Max    <\/p>\n<p>The full-frontal male nudity that Johnson referred to is part of a photo-shoot sequence for the magazine\u2019s centerfold \u2013 since they\u2019re trying to compete with the iconic Burt Reynolds nude Cosmo photoshoot. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe penis montage was very funny,\u201d he said. \u201cThe guys coming in were having fun with it. So that was a very easy sequence to laugh, because they all knew what they were getting into and wanted to be there. It\u2019s funny to see a 70-year-old dude with a ponytail who\u2019s\u00a0 excited to take his pants off. The 10-year-old boy in me was laughing when that stuff was around. What got weird about the other nudity was that it became a normal part of the workplace, like we really were part of [this magazine]. It became normal that a woman in a pair of underpants was walking around with no shirt on and devil ears. It wasn\u2019t odd by midway through the season.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/ophelia-lovibond-jake-johnson.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Joyce (Ophelia Lovibond) and Doug (Jake Johnson)  pitch their idea to try and get ad sales. \" \/>Joyce (Ophelia Lovibond) and Doug (Jake Johnson)  pitch their idea to try and get ad sales. HBO Max    <\/p>\n<p>Another factor that drew Johnson to \u201cMinx\u201d was his character\u2019s aesthetic \u2014 although the outfits did take some getting used to. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cHis jewelry and button-down and high-heeled shoes felt so foreign to me. But, once you throw that stuff on, it\u2019s hard not to have a little bit of swagger,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I understood why you\u2019ve got those guys from the \u201970s walking a certain way. The clothes make the man.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDoug was kind of a mix of my uncle Eddy and my dad \u2013 I come from a long line of salesmen,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were just a lot of characters who I grew up around. One of the things that I like about Doug was that his main goal is to sell magazines and win, and he really doesn\u2019t care who helps him do it. His big battle in life is what\u2019s more important \u2014 winning at capitalism or being a good person? And that\u2019s a fun thing about Doug, you feel it with him. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt times, he\u2019s got to treat people s\u2013ty in order to get ahead.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jake Johnson said he hopes the raunchier aspects of his new show, \u201cMinx,\u201d will not deter viewers.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s a show I really believe in, and I think it\u2019s really fun.
