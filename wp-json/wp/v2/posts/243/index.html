Texting is also faster than other communication methods, allowing you to resolve issues and connect with customers without making them wait long.<\/p>\n<h3>When should businesses use text message marketing?<\/h3>\n<p>Business owners and text message marketers should abide by standard business communications etiquette. Limit your messaging to business hours (i.e., weekdays from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.), being mindful of different time zones where your subscribers live, and avoid sending too many messages at once.<\/p>\n<h3>What industries benefit the most from text message marketing?<\/h3>\n<p>Any business that needs or wants to communicate directly with customers can benefit from text message marketing. It&#8217;s a great way to connect with your consumer base, adding a personal touch to your business communications and customer support. That said, some specific types of companies that often need to text customers are those in the hospitality and service industries, appointment-based businesses, and retailers that run frequent sales and special deals.<\/p>\n<h3>Is text message marketing effective?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, text message marketing can be a highly effective way to reach your customers and connect with them on a personal level, because most people check their text messages far more often than their email. It is also cost-effective, allowing you to reach a large number of customers for a generally low monthly or annual fee.<\/p>\n<h3>How can you send bulk text messages?<\/h3>\n<p>While the exact method for sending bulk text messages varies by provider, you must generally import the list of contacts you want to message. Then, you would draft a bulk text message to be sent to this contact list and schedule it for the appropriate time.<\/p>\n<h3>Is it legal to send marketing messages via text?<\/h3>\n<p>Businesses can legally send marketing text messages to customers if they follow practices outlined in the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) and the CAN-SPAM Act. Enforced by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), these laws ensure that businesses cannot send marketing messages to any consumers who do not wish to receive them. Businesses can be fined up to $1,500 per willful violation if they don&#8217;t adhere to laws like TCPA.<\/p>\n<h3>How do you get consent to send text messages to your customers?<\/h3>\n<p>The TCPA requires companies to get express written consent to send SMS marketing messages to any customer. The best way to obtain consent is by spelling out your communication terms in a clear and conspicuous manner on a form or advertisement. With this type of language, the customer can then provide their phone number (either directly on the form or by texting a number listed on your ad) with the intention of giving permission to be contacted by your company.<\/p>\n<h3>How many people open text messages?<\/h3>\n<p>The answer may be more than you\u2019d expect! Generally speaking, 98 percent of SMS messages are opened. This is great news for text message marketing strategies, as this data predicts a high success rate. Even better, three-quarters of consumers <i>prefer<\/i> text message marketing offers as opposed to seeing ads on websites.<\/p>\n<h3>What is the best way to track the results of text message marketing campaigns?<\/h3>\n<p>Tracking your text message marketing campaigns is an important step in the process. It\u2019s important to know whether your potential customers are engaging with the content you\u2019re sending. To track your campaign and know its success rate, start by confirming that the SMS messages you\u2019re sending are delivered. There are digital tools to help track this. Then, look at how many people engaged with the content you sent, leading them to your site. These two steps are simple ways to see how your campaign is being received.\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Why should businesses use text message marketing?
