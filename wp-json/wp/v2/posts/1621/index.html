This is a considerably higher rate of survival than when the study when previously conducted between 2008-2012, in which survival to discharge was 7% (22\/334) for live-born infants at 22 weeks and 32% (252\/779) for live-born infants at 23 weeks.<\/p>\n<p>This improvement in outcomes for extremely pre-term infants can be attributed to multiple factors, including enhanced treatment protocols across participating medical centers, according to Carl D&#8217;Angio, M.D., co-author and Chief of the Division of Neonatology at URMC.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Academic medical centers have been taking best-practices, applying them, and disseminating them to a wider and wider group nationally,&#8221; said D&#8217;Angio.<\/p>\n<p>Collective improvement in care in a variety of areas has contributed to the change in outcomes, according to D&#8217;Angio. &#8220;When we look at survival at almost any group of infants, it&#8217;s a bundle of factors. There are similarities and differences in the way they&#8217;re treated at various centers, but there are elements where we&#8217;ve collectively moved forward, such as ventilation, nutrition and hydration.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>When infants are born at 22 or 23 weeks, nearly every organ is immature, with the lungs and the brain being among the systems most at risk, according to D&#8217;Angio.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to studying survival outcomes, the paper assessed the health of severely pre-term infants after two years, including effects such as neurodevelopment, cerebral palsy, vision, hearing, rehospitalizations, and need for assistive devices. Slightly more than 8% had moderate to severe cerebral palsy, 1.5% had vision loss in both eyes, 2.5% needed hearing aids or cochlear implants, and 15% required mobility aids such as orthotics, braces, walkers, or wheelchairs.<\/p>\n<p>Nearly 49% had no or only mild neurodevelopmental impairment, about 29% had moderate neurodevelopmental impairment and roughly 21% had severe neurodevelopmental impairment.<\/p>\n<p>This study &#8212; and overall improvement in outcomes &#8212; can help clinicians provide clear information in discussions with families when babies are born extremely pre-term.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We as clinicians support parents in a shared decision-making process when babies are born at the limits of viability,&#8221; said D&#8217;Angio. &#8220;The imminent delivery of an extremely premature infant is a major stressor for families. An important part of helping parents cope is presenting the data we have and letting parents know what to expect in the long-haul. This latest study is positive news for shaping those discussions and providing a more optimistic probability for good outcomes.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Story Source:<\/p>\n<p>Materials provided by University of Rochester Medical Center.
