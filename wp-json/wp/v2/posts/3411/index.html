They signed veteran \u2013 and familiar face to coach Frank Reich \u2013 Nick Foles to back up Ryan.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat [general manager] Chris [Ballard] and I said was in a perfect world, you get a proven backup, but if it doesn\u2019t happen, we\u2019re not going to chase it,\u201d Reich said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to overpay. We\u2019re not going to do something crazy that could hurt the team long-term.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I wanted Nick since I\u2019ve been here to be on this team because I think he\u2019s that good of a player. I think he\u2019s the perfect backup quarterback. It literally fell into our lap. We didn\u2019t chase it. If it wouldn\u2019t have worked out, we would have been happy with Sam [Ehlinger], but we\u2019re really happy we got Nick.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Having stability at quarterback is one less concern for the Colts, who have legitimate expectations to win the AFC South this season.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/blog\/indianapolis-colts\/post\/_\/id\/27509\/\" \/>The Indianapolis Colts hope the veteran quarterback leadership they found in offseason additions Matt Ryan and Nick Foles will get them over the hump in 2022.\u00a0Zach Bolinger\/Icon Sportswire<\/p>\n<p>Last season, there were times they had more to worry about at quarterback than Wentz\u2019s inconsistency. Wentz missed an extended period of time in training camp with a left foot injury that required surgery. Then he sprained his left ankle in a Week 2 loss to the Los Angeles Rams.<\/p>\n<p>And you can\u2019t forget about the unvaccinated Wentz getting COVID-19 late in the season when the Colts were in the playoff hunt. Although he played in Week 17, he didn&#8217;t practice all week, and the Colts lost 23-20 to the Arizona Cardinals.<\/p>\n<p>It got to the point that Reich even put in a call to former starter Philip Rivers to see if he had any interest in coming out of retirement to play for them.<\/p>\n<p>Foles, if pressed into playing time, is familiar with Reich\u2019s offense after they, and Wentz, were together in Philadelphia, where Reich was the offensive coordinator. After Wentz suffered a torn left ACL late in the 2017 season, Foles stepped in and led the Eagles to a Super Bowl victory over the New England Patriots. Foles was on the receiving end of tight end Trey Burton&#8217;s touchdown pass on the legendary \u2018Philly Special\u2019 trick play in that game.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a guy in Nick Foles who has proven that he can do it at the biggest level and the biggest stage, in any kind of weather, in any kind of moment,\u201d Reich said. \u201cI like to think of it that sometimes there are backups that can come in and manage a game and squeak out a win or two, and there are some that can throw for 500 yards and win a game. That\u2019s what Nick has proven he can do. He can win a shootout. He can win the shootout, and he can win a close game, make the key plays in a close game.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Foles hasn\u2019t been as effective since Reich left the Eagles to become the Colts&#8217; coach after that Super Bowl. He is a combined 7-10 as a starter in his final season with the Eagles (2018) and stops with the Jacksonville Jaguars and Chicago Bears. The Bears released Foles earlier this offseason, which caused him to really think hard about where his next stop was going to be. He had no interest in just jumping ship to his sixth different team during his NFL career, which started in 2012.<\/p>\n<p><img data-src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0415\/r1000249_608x342_16-9.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0415\/r1000249_608x342_16-9.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Chiefs rookie Karlaftis is &#8216;relentless&#8217;<br \/>\u2022 Cowboys&#8217; Lamb ready to be &#8216;that guy&#8217;<br \/>\u2022 Vinny Curry&#8217;s life-threatening ordeal<br \/>\u2022 Irv Smith Jr. eyes breakout season<br \/>\u2022 Jacksonville Jaguars roster roundup<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was going to be picky and be smart about it because I have two little kids and one on the way, and I\u2019m not going to move my family just to go to work,\u201d Foles told reporters this week. \u201cLike, I want to enjoy the grind.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Foles knows his role in Indianapolis: back up Ryan, help provide insight in the quarterback room and step in and play if needed.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not a complex situation.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is Matt\u2019s team,\u201d Foles said. \u201cHe\u2019s the leader, and he\u2019s running the ship. \u2026 I think any time you have a QB room like this, you\u2019re excited to go to work every day.
