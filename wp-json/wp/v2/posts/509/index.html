And two of my favorite sitcoms are \u2018Parks and Recreation\u2019 and \u2018The Office.\u2019 I just really love that kind of fake documentary format. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo, when I heard about \u2018Welcome to Flatch\u2019 being that kind of vibe, it was exciting.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Premiering Thursday (March 17) at 9:30 p.m., \u201cWelcome to Flatch,\u201d is based on the British series \u201cThis Country\u201d and revolves around a documentary crew following the mundane daily lives of people in the fictional town of Flatch, Ohio (population 1,526).<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/TC-S1_07-Seann_0104_R-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Seann William Scott in a priest collar. \" \/>Seann William Scott as Father Joe, a small town reverend with a musical past.     <\/p>\n<p>Among the town\u2019s citizens are \u201cFather Joe\u201d (Scott), a reverend who has recently relocated from the big city; ne\u2019er-do-well prankster cousins Kelly (Chelsea Holmes) and Shrub (Sam Straley); Cheryl (Aya Cash), who moved to Flatch with Father Joe before he dumped her and stuck around to run the local newspaper; Kelly\u2019s overachieving nemesis Nadine (Taylor Ortega); and oddball Big Mandy (Krystal Smith).\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a rare small-screen role for Scott, who is best known for movies such as \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d and the \u201cIce Age\u201d franchise \u2013 although, he said \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d remains the project that fans approach him about the most frequently. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe I\u2019m a working actor. When I got that movie, I was just so excited for the opportunity, I tried to make the most of it. I feel blessed and lucky that people still remember that character.

I think it just depends on the project,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the things with \u2018Welcome to Flatch\u2019\u00a0was that I wasn\u2019t really looking to play a lead character \u2013 I wasn\u2019t looking to be on set 16 hours a day. I wanted to spend more time with my family. And when I heard [Father Joe]\u00a0was a former lead singer of a spiritual boy band, I was like, \u2018I\u2019m in. Oh, that\u2019s the guy.\u2019 Once he decided to go solo and that fell apart, and his whole life fell apart, and he\u2019s never really gotten past his old glory days\u2026that\u2019s a character that could be fun to play.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/TC-S1_101-scA68-BH_01457.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Father Joe (Seann William Scott) holds a mic and stands in front of a hay bale. \" \/>Father Joe (Sean William Scott) at the town\u2019s local scarecrow contest.     <\/p>\n<p>It also helped that Scott has a similar background to the characters on the show, since he grew up in a small Midwestern town of Cottage Grove, Minn.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a bit bigger than our fictional town of Flatch, Ohio, but I could definitely relate to the closeness in community and everybody knowing each other, and having a bunch of eccentric personalities,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd good people who are doing the best they can and supporting each other and trying to get by.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To prepare to play a spiritual leader, however, Scott did not dive into scripture.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I met with [showrunner Jenny Bicks and exec producer Paul Feig], I was in pretty good shape. And they were like \u2018We don\u2019t really think Father Joe should be a guy who\u2019s exercising every day,&#8217;\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Okay, I\u2019m a method actor,\u2019 which I\u2019m not. \u2018I\u2019m going to gain a little weight for Father Joe.\u2019 So, I did, and when I showed up on set, it\u2019s not like they were shocked, it\u2019s not like I was Marlon Brando showing up on \u2018Apocalypse Now,\u2019 but I definitely was a little husky.
