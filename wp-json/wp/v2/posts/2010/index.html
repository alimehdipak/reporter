By choosing different types of drinks, you could really have a major impact on your teeth and oral health. Drinking more water is still one of the best things you can do for your mouth. Here are some of the best (and worst) drinks for your teeth.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>The Best:<\/b><\/h2>\n<h3><b>Milk<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dietary calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D work together to strengthen and repair teeth&#8217; enamel. Milk also has a protein called casein that supports tooth decay prevention and protection of enamel. Milk naturally contains sugar, but it isn\u2019t likely to lead to tooth decay for individuals with milk allergies or lactose intolerance.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Green or White Tea<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Green and white teas are among the healthiest types of tea for your teeth, with antioxidants that help fight cavity-causing bacteria and reduce inflammation in your gums. Black tea leaves contribute to stains that can happen to your <a href=\"https:\/\/probuzz.mystrikingly.com\/blog\/dentist-in-irvine-ca\">teeth<\/a> over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Tap Water<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tap water is a cavity-fighting machine. Tap water is also good at cleaning your teeth and reducing the acid produced by bacteria in your mouth. Most tap water also contains fluoride, which helps strengthen your enamel, making it less likely for tooth decay to occur.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>The Worst:<\/b><\/h2>\n<h3><b>Soda<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sugary drinks, like Coca-Cola, are bad for your teeth because they\u2019re high in sugar and have a strongly acidic pH. The color of dark sodas like Coke is also detrimental to teeth because it stains the teeth yellow.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Wine<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In most scenarios, red wine will stain your teeth and white wine is more acidic and negatively impacts your enamel. There are ways to reduce the negative effects, though. Cheese can be used as a protective coating for your teeth when you&#8217;re drinking it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Fruit Juice<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fruit juice is mostly made of water, yet it is often considered very acidic for its contents. Generally, fruit juice contains a lot of vitamins in it. Carbonated, citrus-based, and cranberry fruit juices are the most acidic to drink. If you&#8217;re still trying to squeeze some juice, dilute it by adding a splash of water or drinking through a straw<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Fruit Punch<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With all the shortcomings of juice, fruit punch is no replacement. It\u2019s full of sugar and high fructose corn syrup and it can cause cavities as well. Fruit punches are also more acidic than real fruit juice, so if you drink too much, they can damage your enamel.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Sports and Energy Drinks<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Though sports drinks are good for rehydrating and providing electrolytes, they&#8217;re actually bad for your teeth. Sports drinks, packed with sugar, are quite acidic and can destroy the enamel on your teeth, leaving them prone to decay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You don&#8217;t need to stop drinking the beverages that you enjoy, but it&#8217;s wise to be aware of the consequences of these drinks on your teeth. It is wise to keep an eye on what these drinks can do to your<a href=\"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/view\/blogbuzz\/sites\/jeevan-ghatnekar-dds\"> teeth<\/a>. And while you will have positive benefits from both mixed and distilled alcoholic beverages, water should be consumed often and without feeling thirsty.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>People often think of the food they eat when deciding to change their diet, but they don\u2019t consider the other drinks that can cause a negative effect on their oral health.
