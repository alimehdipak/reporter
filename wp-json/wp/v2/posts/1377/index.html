The name of Ernestine\u2019s hometown, Grand Rapids, describes her rocky, unpredictable road well.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>After every victory for Ernestine (Debra Messing) \u2014 an invitation to prom, the birth of a child, the starting of a new business \u2014 a crushing blow soon follows. Deaths, cheating and health scares are all weathered with Midwestern steeliness that hides immense pain.<\/p>\n<p>What really packs a punch, though, are her smaller losses. During one scene, we race through a series of her birthday celebrations in her eighties and nineties over a matter of seconds. The parties start out big and boisterous, and by the end of the sequence, no one is visiting her house anymore. That all too truthful observation about aging makes you want to run out and call grandma.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/0219-Susannah-Flood-Enrico-Colantoni-Debra-Messing-Christopher-Livingston-John-Earl-Jelks-Crystal-Finn-in-Roundabout-Theatre-Companys-BIRTHDAY-CANDLES.-Photo-by-Joan-Marcus-2022.jpg?w=1024\" \/>Debra Messing, center, plays 90 years of one woman\u2019s life in \u201cBirthday Candles\u201d on Broadway.Joan Marcus    <\/p>\n<p>The play begins when Ernestine is 17, and is learning how to make a birthday cake with her mother \u2014 a tradition she will repeat every single year. These first several minutes are cloying. The actress overdoes it playing a teen, and Haidle writes partly in metaphysical mumbo-jumbo that can be hit-and-miss.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>For instance, her second line is, \u201cIn the career of my soul, how many times have I turned from wonder?\u201d That\u2019s a bit heady for a show\u2019s first 30 seconds.<\/p>\n<p>But \u201cBirthday Candles,\u201d which is set in one kitchen, shakes off the pretentiousness when Ernestine enters middle age and has children of her own. The actors who play rebellious Madeline and Billy, Susannah Flood and Christopher Livingston, storm in with tremendous humor and energy and cut through the weird, stuffy, \u201cPhiladelphia Story\u201d act Messing is doing.<\/p>\n<p>Impressively getting more laughs than the \u201cWill and Grace\u201d star is the hilarious Crystal Finn as Joan, Billy\u2019s neurotic college girlfriend and later wife. When she chastises herself in the third person \u2014 \u201cYou ruin everything, Joan! They\u2019re all laughing at you!\u201d \u2014 she morphs into everybody\u2019s strange in-law. Finn, making her Broadway debut, is a talent to watch.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"716\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/0495-Susannah-Flood-Debra-Messing-in-Roundabout-Theatre-Companys-BIRTHDAY-CANDLES.-Photo-by-Joan-Marcus-2022-1.jpg?w=1024\" \/>Susannah Flood and Debra Messing in \u201cBirthday Candles.\u201d Joan Marcus    <\/p>\n<p>Every actor here other than Messing and Enrico Colantoni,\u00a0who plays a boy who pines for Ernestine named Kenneth, deftly takes on multiple roles (John Earl Jelks plays her husband, Matt, among others). They click like a real family.<\/p>\n<p>Messing, meanwhile, doesn\u2019t quite rise to the occasion of her one very challenging part. She crosses the finish line on likability alone, yet you can\u2019t help but think that Ernestine is a meatier role than Messing has made it. Her youthful and elderly characterizations are too sit-com silly and the transition between ages \u2014 which should be a stellar acting showcase \u2014 is abrupt and stilted.\u00a0Moments that are merely sad in director Vivienne Benesch\u2019s production could be devastating.<\/p>\n<p>And Haidle has his writerly indulgences, too. A goldfish named Atman (\u201cthe Sanskrit word for self\u201d) sits on the kitchen table for most of the play to lend some continuity, but it comes across as gimmick. And \u2014 look out, Julia Child! \u2014 Messing bakes an actual cake onstage. Fun, sure, but it\u2019s awfully tough to smell nostalgic homemade dessert when you\u2019re wearing a medical-grade mask.<\/p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Haidle\u2019s plays (his better \u201cSmokefall\u201d did not receive the production it deserved when it played New York back in 2016) have a way of convincing every audience member they\u2019ve been written just for them. \u201cBirthday Candles,\u201d at its best, bubbles up our own cherished and difficult memories of the people in our lives who\u2019ve come and gone.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are flickers of beauty in the new play \u201cBirthday Candles,\u201d which opened Sunday night on Broadway.
