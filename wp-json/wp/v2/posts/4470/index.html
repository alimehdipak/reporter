This blog discusses the importance of duct cleaning, how cleaning services work, and when you need to clean your home&#8217;s ducts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The importance of air duct cleaning<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Your family breathes the same air flowing through the ducts every day. If left unchecked, your home&#8217;s plumbing can contain allergens, such as pet dander and pollen, that can return to your home and cause health problems. These pollutants can cause health problems for people with allergies, asthma and other respiratory conditions. But when you clean the ducts in your home, you&#8217;ll help improve air quality and keep your environment free of airborne microbes.<\/p>\n<p>Dirt can restrict airflow to the HVAC system. This means your AC furnace has to work harder and use more energy to do its job. However, by keeping the air ducts clean and clear, you will ensure maximum efficiency and performance of your equipment.<\/p>\n<p>Dirty or clogged ventilation systems can lead to damaged coils, contamination, and other problems that often result in expensive repairs. Incorporating duct cleaning into routine maintenance will extend the life of your HVAC system.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How duct cleaning services work<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When choosing a reliable service provider, they will offer the following services as instructed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open access doors to allow cleaning and inspection of the entire system.<\/li>\n<li>Proper inspection of the system before cleaning to ensure no asbestos-containing materials are present in the HVAC system. Remember, these materials require specialized treatment. You shouldn&#8217;t do it on your own and only allow trained and equipped professionals to do this job.<\/li>\n<li>Use a vacuum machine to remove particles and exhaust them outside the home. The professionals should only use high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) equipment to exhaust inside the house.<\/li>\n<li>Protect your belongings, including household furnishings and carpets, during cleaning.<\/li>\n<li>Use controlled brushing while cleaning the air duct together with vacuum cleaning to remove dust and debris.<\/li>\n<li>Use soft-bristled brushes for sheet metal ducts and fiberglass duct boards.<\/li>\n<li>Carefully clean and take measures to protect the ductwork. This includes sealing and re-insulating holes. They will ensure the ductwork is airtight once they finish cleaning.<\/li>\n<li>Follow NADCA&#8217;s standard guidelines for <a href=\"https:\/\/minervaschools.medium.com\/overview-of-air-duct-cleaning-in-sugar-land-tx-7a2cbcf62efb\">air duct cleaning sugar land tx<\/a> and NAIMA&#8217;s recommendations for ducts with fiberglass lining or duct board.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>When to clean your home&#8217;s air ducts<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Air ducts are passages that allow cooling and heating air to flow through your home.
