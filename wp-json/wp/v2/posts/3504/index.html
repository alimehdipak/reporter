Or we can change the settings to use it as a facial, to remove dead skin cells. It has a lot of applications and has worked really well.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/alexa-cryo-5.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Cryo-Recovery eye serum\" width=\"618\" height=\"618\" \/>Cryo-Recovery eye serum, $68 at Charlotte TilburyCharlotte Tilbury    <\/p>\n<p>Although cryo facials deliver instant, if short-lived, freshening and brightening, brown spots take longer to dissipate but the results are permanent. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe skin crusts a bit after treatment,\u201d says Katz. \u201cIt destroys the hyperactive pigment cells, so it turns into a little scab. But then that goes away. Sure, you can use liquid nitrogen to freeze a brown spot, but then you\u2019re left with a white spot in its place.
