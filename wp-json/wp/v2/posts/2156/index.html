The Giants haven&#8217;t had a top-tier pass-rusher since trading Jason Pierre-Paul. Since 2015, they have had one edge rusher (Markus Golden) reach double-digit sacks.

They can survive with Brady Christensen at left tackle. They can&#8217;t survive with Sam Darnold at quarterback. Willis is a risk, but as offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo noted, he&#8217;s a &#8220;swing for the fence&#8221; guy.

But so does Gardner, who didn&#8217;t allow a receiving touchdown in three years at Cincinnati. With James Bradberry likely gone by the end of the weekend, cornerback makes a ton of sense here.

That might matter to an organization that has made its share of early-round mistakes recently and can&#8217;t afford to miss on its first top-10 pick since 2010. Johnson has big-time production on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 (12 sacks last season en route to being named ACC Defensive Player of the Year) and the body type (6-foot-5, 250) the Seahawks are looking for at outside linebacker in their 3-4 defense.

Drake London&#8217;s size (6-foot-4) and catch radius make him attractive, but Wilson&#8217;s explosiveness and separation ability give him the edge. He&#8217;d fit in nicely with Elijah Moore and Corey Davis. The Jets haven&#8217;t had a Pro Bowl receiver since Brandon Marshall (2015). They&#8217;re overdue. They really like Jameson Williams, but this could be too high for a player coming off an ACL tear in his left knee.

But Washington would like a big target among its receiving corps and really likes London. At 6-foot-4, he provides a wide catch radius for quarterback Carson Wentz so he doesn&#8217;t always have to pinpoint throws. The Commanders also love how London makes contested catches; for some that reveals an inability to create separation but for others it shows the type of catches players have to make all the time in the NFL. Washington&#8217;s offense hasn&#8217;t ranked in the top 10 in yards or points since 2016; adding more talent was a must. <em>&#8212; John Keim<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nfl\/500\/min.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"31\" \/><\/p>\n<p><b>Derek Stingley Jr., CB, LSU<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The Vikings have drafted a cornerback in the first round three times in the previous seven drafts, but none of the three &#8212; Trae Waynes (2015), Mike Hughes (2018) and Jeff Gladney (2020) &#8212; remain with the team. The Vikings re-signed Patrick Peterson and added free agent Chandon Sullivan, but the position needs the kind of energetic infusion Stingley can provide. Stingley&#8217;s injury issues can&#8217;t be ignored, but he&#8217;s a top-five prospect without them.

This pick improves a position of need for Houston and gives it another playmaker.

There will be high expectations with Davis, who was primarily a run-stopper in college.

While picking a receiver in the first round for a third consecutive year is less than ideal, Williams is the best player available. His game-changing speed will be worth the wait as he recovers from ACL surgery on his left knee. Paired with fellow Alabama standouts Jalen Hurts and DeVonta Smith, the Eagles&#8217; offense will be extra explosive with the addition of Williams, who averaged 19.9 yards per reception and racked up 15 touchdowns last season. <em>&#8212; Tim McManus<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nfl\/500\/no.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"31\" \/><\/p>\n<p><b>Charles Cross, OT, Mississippi State<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Quarterback Kenny Pickett is an intriguing possibility and receiver would be a consideration if one of the top four prospects had fallen.

He is a three-year starter who has played four different positions along the offensive line. Green&#8217;s versatility is a good fit for the Titans because he&#8217;s a natural fit at left guard, which is exactly what Tennessee needs after releasing Rodger Saffold. With 35 career starts under his belt, Green is a plug-and-play prospect. <em>&#8212; Turron Davenport<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nfl\/500\/tb.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"31\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Lewis Cine, S, Georgia<\/p>\n<p>Yes, the Bucs have needs at defensive tackle and guard and still don&#8217;t know the status of tight end Rob Gronkowski. But with defensive tackle Devonte Wyatt and guard Zion Johnson off the board, Cine and Daxton Hill were best available with Cine&#8217;s skill set being a better fit to replace Jordan Whitehead, whom the Bucs lost in free agency. Cine is a thumper, very active downhill and versatile in that he can cover. And while they signed Keanu Neal in free agency, it&#8217;s a one-year deal, and he has a history of injuries. They could still find help in the trenches on Day 2. <em>&#8212; Jenna Laine<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nfl\/500\/gb.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"31\" \/><img data-src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0307\/nfl_top_100_free_agents_cr_16x9.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0307\/nfl_top_100_free_agents_cr_16x9.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Best remaining free agents \u00bb | Grades \u00bb<br \/>\u2022 Experts weigh in \u00bb  | Fantasy spin \u00bb<br \/>\u2022 32 teams, 32 nuggets \u00bb | Top 100 \u00bb<br \/>\u2022  Every team&#8217;s most impactful move \u00bb<br \/>More NFL free agency coverage \u00bb<\/p>\n<p><b>George Karlaftis, DE, Purdue<\/b><\/p>\n<p>GM Brian Gutekunst loves defense in the first round. He has made five previous first-round picks and four have been on that side of the ball. After releasing Za&#8217;Darius Smith, there&#8217;s a need for another pass-rusher &#8212; especially one who can rush both inside and on the edge. <em>&#8212; Rob Demovsky <\/em><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nfl\/500\/kc.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"31\" \/><\/p>\n<p><b>Daxton Hill, DB, Michigan<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The departure of Tyrann Mathieu leaves a void in the secondary and free-agent addition Justin Reid is only part of the solution.

That leaves them to attack cornerback depth, an area team executive Duke Tobin identified as an issue after last year&#8217;s Super Bowl loss. Booth has what the Bengals are looking for at outside corner &#8212; good speed, quality length and the ability to play the ball in the air. That last part is incredibly valuable, especially for a Bengals team that won the AFC (and nearly the Super Bowl) because of its defensive turnovers. Booth had three interceptions in his third and final year at Clemson. With Eli Apple and Chidobe Awuzie projected as Week 1 starters, Booth has the luxury of working his way into the rotation and finding his footing in the NFL. <em>&#8212; Ben Baby<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nfl\/500\/det.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"31\" \/><\/p>\n<p><b>Desmond Ridder, QB, Cincinnati<\/b><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s no secret current Lions quarterback Jared Goff is the guy for right now &#8212; and maybe even next year. But, the quarterback depth on this roster certainly can&#8217;t be overlooked forever. Both David Blough and Tim Boyle haven&#8217;t proven they can run the show if something were to happen to Goff, and the Lions need to address this position badly. Ridder is also a proven winner, ending his college career with the third-most wins by a quarterback in college football history with 44. The Lions need that mentality as they&#8217;re in the midst of a rebuild. <em>&#8212; Eric Woodyard<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Apr 26, 2022NFL NationESPN You&#8217;ve heard this is the most unpredictable draft in years.
