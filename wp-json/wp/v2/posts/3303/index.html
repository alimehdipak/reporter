Recently, Summit Brands rebranded Super Iron Out and is currently labeling the product as Iron Out.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>How does Super Iron Out Work?<\/h3>\n<p>Iron OUT cleans the mineral bed and removes heavy-duty iron buildup that reduces the softening and recharging efficiency of the water softener resin. The product is backwashed from the system after the cleaning is complete and regular drinking water is resumed.<\/p>\n<p>What does Iron Out remove?<\/p>\n<p>Iron OUT Outdoor can safely be used to remove rust stains from concrete, vinyl siding, decks, patios, fencing, docks, plastic, fiberglass, boats, around the pool and many other exterior surfaces. Our #1 brand rust stain remover easily applies and is safe for use around vegetation.<\/p>\n<p>What is in super iron out?<\/p>\n<p>Super Iron Out \u201cOutdoor\u201d contains Ethanedioic acid, dihydrate. Iron Out liquid contains Oxalic acid and 1,2-Propanediol. Iron Out powder contains Sodium hydrosulfite, Sodium carbonate, Sodium metabisulfite, Citric Acid, and Sodium sulfite.<\/p>\n<p>Which rust remover is best?<\/p>\n<p>Best Overall: Evapo-Rust Super Safe Rust Remover<\/p>\n<p>Our top pick is the Evapo-Rust Super Safe Rust Remover, a biodegradable product that gets rid of rust in just minutes\u2014without the need for sanding or scrubbing. The water-based liquid requires no special equipment or supplies to use.<\/p>\n<h3>Can you drink water with Iron Out in it?<\/h3>\n<p>Although a low level of iron cannot harm your health, it contains bacteria. In addition to this, high iron in water content leads to an overload which can cause diabetes, hemochromatosis, stomach problems, and nausea. It can also damage the liver, pancreas, and heart.<\/p>\n<p>Will iron out hurt my septic system?<\/p>\n<p>When used as directed, Iron OUT Automatic Toilet Bowl is plumbing and septic safe and will not harm the bacteria within the system.<\/p>\n<p>How toxic is iron out?<\/p>\n<p>WARNING: May be fatal if swallowed. Harmful if inhaled or absorbed through skin. Causes severe irritation and\/or burns to skin, eyes and respiratory tract. Do not get in eyes, or on skin or clothing.<\/p>\n<p>How often should I use iron out in my water softener?<\/p>\n<p>If the water in your home contains high levels of clear water iron, it may be beneficial to use a resin bed cleaner to remove any build up of iron residue in the softener resin bed. In this case, we recommend cleaning the resin bed at least every six months.<\/p>\n<h3>How long does it take for Iron Out to work?<\/h3>\n<p>It can take 2-3 weeks of taking iron supplements before they start to work. Depending on your iron need, it may take up to 90 days to feel an increase in your energy. You may need to continue supplementing your dietary intake of iron to meet your body\u2019s daily iron needs.<\/p>\n<p>Is Iron Out a good product?<\/p>\n<p>If you need just one versatile rust-removal product for your home, we highly recommend Iron Out as a simple-to-use, spray-on gel product that works quickly on a wide variety of objects and surfaces. It\u2019s also one of the most affordable removers in our lineup.<\/p>\n<p>Does Iron Out remove rust?<\/p>\n<p>Iron OUT\u00ae Spray is specifically formulated to cling as it dissolves the toughest rust stains on contact, eliminating the need for scrubbing. The unique formula is highly effective in removing rust stains, yet safer than traditional liquid rust stain removers.<\/p>\n<p>Does Iron Out remove calcium?<\/p>\n<p>Cleans Rust &amp; Hard Water Deposits<\/p>\n<p>Made by the makers of Iron OUT\u00ae, the heavy-duty rust removal experts, this product is specially formulated to dissolve tough lime, calcium and rust stains caused by hard water.<\/p>\n<p>What is the active ingredient in rust remover?<\/p>\n<p>Hydrochloric acid (which is also called muriatic acid in its diluted form), as well as phosphoric acid and sulfuric acid may be used in rust removal formulas using strong acids. These are mineral acids, and they are highly corrosive, especially in concentrated forms.<\/p>\n<h3>Can you mix Iron Out and bleach?<\/h3>\n<p>Answer. Well water and liquid bleach are just not very compatible. The sodium hypochlorite active in liquid bleach reacts with the iron and changes it to the chemical form as rust. This new yellow\/red discoloration then deposits on clothes, and after drying has essentially dyed the clothes.<\/p>\n<p>What eats rusty metal?<\/p>\n<p>Remove Rust With White Vinegar<\/p>\n<p>To tackle items with significant rust, submerge your rusty tools or knives in a bowl of vinegar and let them sit overnight. Once they have had a good soak, remove them from the vinegar and scrub the rust off with steel wool or a wire brush. (This may require some elbow grease.)<\/p>\n<p>Can Coke remove rust?<\/p>\n<p>Coca-Cola is carbonated, which allows it to dissolve with metal oxides and break up rust on a variety of metals and alloys. Phosphoric acid also gives it rust-busting power, while citric acid makes it an effective stain remover.<\/p>\n<p>Can WD-40 get rid of rust?<\/p>\n<p>WD-40 can help remove rust from metals like iron, chrome, and stainless steel without further damaging the surface of the metal or removing the paint. The Multi-Use Product is great for loosening and removing excessive surface rust.<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cSuper Iron Out and Iron Out are the exact same product with the same formulation.
