Should you brush your teeth before or after breakfast? Some people believe that you should brush your teeth after breakfast because you will have had a high-calorie meal and there is a greater chance that plaque will be built up on your teeth. Others argue that you should brush your teeth before breakfast because you will have had a smaller calorie intake overnight and plaque will not form as easily. There is no right answer &#8211; it simply depends on what works best for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>What is the difference between brushing teeth before and after breakfast?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most people think of brushing their teeth before breakfast as good <a href=\"https:\/\/probuzz.mystrikingly.com\/blog\/everything-you-need-to-know-about-root-canal\">dental<\/a> hygiene, but what about after breakfast? Is there a difference between brushing teeth before and after breakfast?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a scientific difference. According to the American Dental Association (ADA), \u201cThere is limited evidence that toothpaste used before bedtime may improve overall oral health. However, brushing with a fluoride-containing toothpaste just prior to going to bed does appear to reduce the risk of sleep apnea\u201d\u00a0 While it is reasonable to brush your teeth before bed, it is not necessary if you use a fluoride-containing toothpaste.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Pros and Cons of brushing teeth before breakfast:<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before brushing your <a href=\"https:\/\/webdental.com\/blogs\/what-is-the-best-whitener-for-your-teeth\">teeth<\/a>, think about the pros and cons of doing so before breakfast. Brushing your teeth before breakfast can be a good habit to get into because:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It can help you avoid morning sickness.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It can keep your smile looking dazzling and healthy.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It can remove any food that may be stuck in between your teeth.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It can help reduce bad breath in the morning.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It can make it easier to floss later in the day if you do not have time to do it right after breakfast since toothpaste will not stick to dry skin as much when it is still wet from brushing teeth earlier in the morning\u3002<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><b>Brushing teeth after breakfast may have some benefits<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but many people forget to brush their teeth. According to a study published in The Journal of Dentistry, brushing teeth after breakfast may have some benefits. Researchers found that people who brushed their teeth after breakfast had lower levels of plaque and bacteria on their teeth than those who didn&#8217;t brush. This may be because brushing removes food particles and bacteria that can cause tooth decay and gum disease.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Conclusion: It really depends on personal preference<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It really depends on your personal preference. Personally, I brush my teeth before breakfast because it&#8217;s the most important meal of the day, and I want to make sure my oral hygiene is top-notch. However, if you feel like brushing after breakfast will keep you more alert, go for it! Just make sure to brush thoroughly and floss afterward to avoid any potential tooth problems.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but what about brushing your teeth?
