Family members dealing with health issues. COVID-19 hitting key members of the team, including himself. And to cap things off, the Colts\u2019 playoff aspirations came to a screeching halt with a Week 18 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, who finished with the league&#8217;s worst record despite the win. That season-ending loss had owner Jim Irsay fuming during the game, on the plane ride home and inside the team facility when he returned.<\/p>\n<p>Some four-plus months later, Leonard, who often tries to keep his best game face on in front of the camera, acknowledged things weren\u2019t right with him last season.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI fell out of love with the game,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t enjoying it anymore.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s something nobody would have ever imagined coming out of Leonard\u2019s mouth. Not the same Darius Leonard who uses every kind of negativity as a motivation when he was making countless tackles, intercepting passes or attacking like Mike Tyson when he punches the ball out of opponents\u2019 hands for a forced fumble.<\/p>\n<p>But that\u2019s how Leonard felt after the Colts couldn\u2019t beat the Jaguars in a game in which the defense had no answers for rookie Trevor Lawrence and Jacksonville\u2019s offense in Week 18.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe first month, I didn\u2019t wanna go home, didn\u2019t wanna be around anybody, didn\u2019t wanna face it yet,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cBecause the question was gonna come: What the hell happened in Jacksonville? And in that moment, I really didn\u2019t know what happened.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/blog\/indianapolis-colts\/post\/_\/id\/27452\/\" \/>Indianapolis Colts linebacker Darius Leonard is back to his old self now after saying, &#8220;I fell out of love with the game&#8221; following the rough ending to the 2021 season.\u00a0Zach Bolinger\/Icon Sportswire<\/p>\n<p>Leonard never thought he would need to step away &#8212; not when there was a point in the season when the Colts were one of the hottest teams in the NFL and had some pundits calling them contenders in the AFC.<\/p>\n<p>Even Leonard, who faced adversity throughout his life, was beaten up mentally and physically over what ended up being the most trying season of his four-year NFL career, which includes being named a first-team All-Pro three times.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou hold in all your emotions,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cYou put a smile on so many other people\u2019s faces, and the time that you need it &#8212; a lot of people who are around you, they see you smile all the time; they don\u2019t understand that just because I smile sometimes, I ask everybody how they\u2019re doing &#8212; sometimes it\u2019s OK to ask me how am I doing?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAsk and truly have a conversation with me and understand that I\u2019m human, too. I have problems. I go through a lot of things that a lot of people are going through. &#8230; You sit here and you feel like you have to hold a shade up with your personal life because your football life eats you up, and I just wasn\u2019t in a good mental place because I wouldn\u2019t be around my family whenever they needed it.\u201d<img data-src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0512\/nfl_post_draft_power_rankings_cr_16x9_608x342.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0512\/nfl_post_draft_power_rankings_cr_16x9_608x342.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Post-draft NFL Power Rankings<br \/>\u2022 Chiefs&#8217; Moore not a Hill replacement<br \/>\u2022 How Rams replenished their secondary<br \/>\u2022 Texans rookie react to viral video<br \/>\u2022 Schedules, predictions for all 32<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>The Colts&#8217; linebackers are one of the closest groups on the roster. Fellow starters Zaire Franklin and Bobby Okereke knew what Leonard had gone through the past few months.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The way the season ended kind of broke all of our hearts in different ways, and I would say that we all have to go through our own kind of healing process to get back rolling,&#8221; Franklin said. &#8220;For me, it was a lot different &#8230; I can see what Darius went through.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That\u2019s good for him, somebody who dedicates so much to the game and works so hard at it. A lot of times you need that time to step away from ball, be with family, get a perspective of the world. I definitely feel like he\u2019s in a better spirit this year. I tell [Leonard] all the time, I\u2019m always there to support him, always have his back no matter what.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Leonard is back, he says he&#8217;s healthy, and the defense has brought in significant additions in cornerback Stephon Gilmore (the NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 2019), defensive end Yannick Ngakoue and coordinator Gus Bradley, who replaced Matt Eberflus after he left to coach the Chicago Bears.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Made me happy, especially with the rush, helping [DeForest Buckner] and [Kwity Paye], adding [Ngakoue] and a shutdown corner in Gilmore,&#8221; Leonard said. &#8220;You think about all the takeaways we&#8217;re going to have. Stephon is great at tracking the ball. It&#8217;s a better opportunity for us to get more takeaways. &#8230; We have to have 40-plus takeaways in the season.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>INDIANAPOLIS &#8212; Darius Leonard was in a dark place late last season, as what had been a promising Indianapolis Colts season was collapsing around the linebacker and the rest of the organization.An ankle injury that bothered him nonstop.
