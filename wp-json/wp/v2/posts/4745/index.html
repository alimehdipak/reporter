Gomez was a standout performer in the Belgian First Division last season, contributing to 17 goals in 39 appearances.<\/p>\n<p>Man City have been on the lookout for a new left-sided defender after they parted ways with Oleksandr Zinchenko, who joined Arsenal for \u00a332m in July.

He missed a large part of last season through injury.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Mikkel is, in my opinion, another classic Brentford signing. He is a young player with big potential to develop further,&#8221; manager Thomas Frank said. Brentford host Manchester United on Saturday in their second Premier League match of the season after a 2-2 draw at Leicester City last week.<\/p>\n<p>20.45 BST: As confirmed by the club&#8217;s official channels, Fulham have completed the signing of West Ham United centre-back Issa Diop. The Frenchman has signed for an undisclosed fee and signed a deal that will keep him with the Cottagers until 2027.<\/p>\n<p>The 25-year-old played 26 games, scored one goal and made two assists for West Ham last season. &#8220;Issa(&#8216;s)&#8230; experience and formidable presence will be important to our squad in this Premier League season and for us to build a bright future in the years ahead,&#8221; Fulham co-owner Tony Khan said.<\/p>\n<p>20.05 BST: Nottingham Forest have made an initial offer for Olympique Lyonnais midfielder Houssem Aouar, reports L&#8217;Equipe, with the Frenchman having been linked with various big-name clubs in recent transfer windows.<\/p>\n<p>While Aouar would be open to a Premier League move, Forest&#8217;s offer is too far from Lyon&#8217;s demands with the clubs having received various offers while being yet to come to an agreement.<\/p>\n<p>Aouar has made 215 appearances for Lyon, where he&#8217;s scored 40 goals and made 35 assists.<\/p>\n<p>19.10 BST: Frenkie de Jong&#8217;s agents have arrived in Barcelona amid continued uncertainty over the midfielder&#8217;s future at the club, with Manchester United and Chelsea still pursuing his signing.<\/p>\n<p>ESPN revealed in July that Barca had agreed a fee of around \u20ac85 million with United, including add-ons. However, the Dutchman has preferred to remain at Camp Nou.<\/p>\n<p>Barca, meanwhile, have told De Jong that if he wants to stay he must take a salary cut, although sources have told ESPN he is reluctant to do so at this stage.<\/p>\n<p>18.20 BST: As confirmed on the club&#8217;s official channels, Malang Sarr has joined AS Monaco on a season-long loan from Chelsea with the Ligue 1 outfit holding an option to make the deal permanent. This is their fourth summer signing following the incomings of Takumi Minamino, Breel Embolo and Thomas Didillon.<\/p>\n<p>The 23-year-old defender joined Chelsea in 2020 on a free transfer from Nice and spent his first year on loan in Porto.<\/p>\n<p>17.39 BST: While waiting for Giacomo Raspadori&#8217;s transfer to Napoli to be completed, Sassuolo are already moving to bring in Andrea Pinamonti from Internazionale, reports Sky Sports Italia. It has been agreed that the deal will be worth \u20ac20m, with Pinamonti now set to have a medical on Thursday morning before signing a contract.<\/p>\n<p>16.43 BST: Manchester United have something of a history when it comes to making unexpected signings of veteran forwards, and they looked like resurrecting that transfer strategy this week with their interest in Marko Arnautovic.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, sources have told ESPN that Bologna&#8217;s asking price for his rights and a fan backlash against the deal scuppered the 33-year-old Austrian&#8217;s chances of joining the likes of Michael Owen, Henrik Larsson, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Edinson Cavani among United&#8217;s roll call of senior strikers.<\/p>\n<p>The club&#8217;s curious approach for strapping centre-forward Arnautovic, who hasn&#8217;t played in the English top flight since 2019 when he left West Ham for Shanghai Port in China, does reveal the type of last-ditch signing they are seeking to make with the new season already underway.<\/p>\n<p>Thankfully, the pool of long-forgotten (but, crucially, still active) Premier League strikers runs surprisingly deep, with many former stars still plying their trade around the world despite being well into their 30s &#8212; making them prime candidates to join United this month. Should coach Erik ten Hag be serious about bolstering his attacking stable with a journeyman forward of a certain age, then he has plenty of options.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Sign Balotelli?

With three days to go until the new campaign starts, however, neither has been registered with the Spanish league. Sources have told ESPN that if they are not registered prior to Barca&#8217;s opening fixture against Rayo, both players could choose to execute a clause that allows them to leave for free.<\/p>\n<p>Fellow summer arrivals Robert Lewandowski, Raphinha and Jules Kounde are also yet to be inscribed with LaLiga, while the contract renewals signed by Sergi Roberto and Ousmane Dembele have not been registered either.<\/p>\n<p>ESPN understands Christensen and Kessie&#8217;s situations are slightly different, though, given they joined Barca for free. Therefore, if they so choose, they would be entitled to leave for free before the transfer window closes.<\/p>\n<p>Sources say at this stage there is no indication it will come to that and president Joan Laporta continues to transmit optimism that all seven players will be registered in time, but Barca are cutting it fine before the start of the season. In the worst case scenario, sources told ESPN Barcelona would seek to speak with the players&#8217; agents to avoid such an extreme outcome because they have until the end of the month to register signings.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Marsden: Why can&#8217;t Barca register summer signings yet? Explaining the situation<\/p>\n<p>15.29 BST: Manchester United players have become frustrated by the saga around Cristiano Ronaldo&#8217;s future, according to The Sun.<\/p>\n<p>Ronaldo submitted a transfer request to leave Old Trafford earlier this summer. The 37-year-old did not take part in United&#8217;s preseason tour of Thailand and Australia because of personal reasons and he started their 2-1 defeat to Brighton on the bench.<\/p>\n<p>Other United players are said to be angry at Ronaldo&#8217;s behaviour and want the situation resolved as quickly as possible. There appear to be few options for the Portugal forward, with Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich and Chelsea having distanced themselves from his signing.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/espnmediazone.com\/us\/files\/2018\/03\/App-Icon-Android-7.png&amp;w=126&amp;site=espnfc\" alt=\"\" width=\"30\" \/>14.56 BST: Bernardo Silva has told ESPN he is happy at Manchester City but admitted his future remains up in the air with just three weeks to go before the end of the transfer window.<\/p>\n<p>Silva has been linked with a move to Barcelona despite the Spanish side&#8217;s difficulties in registering their summer signings who have already arrived at Camp Nou.<\/p>\n<p>On Tuesday, City rubbished reports they have agreed a \u00a367.5m fee with Barcelona for Silva, but, speaking to ESPN, the Portugal midfielder left the door open for a move before the window closes.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always said that I&#8217;m happy here but I have no idea what&#8217;s going to happen,&#8221; Silva, who was a substitute in City&#8217;s 2-0 win against West Ham United on the opening weekend of the Premier League season on Sunday, said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see, honestly.
