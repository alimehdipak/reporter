It embodies all the qualities of my paparazzi approach: exclusive, unrehearsed, off-guard, spontaneous, no appointments \u2014 the only game.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"777\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/ron-galella-dies-04.jpg?w=777\" \/>Galella has been called the \u201cGodfather of the US paparazzi culture\u201d and \u201cPaparazzo Extraordinaire.\u201dCindy Ord    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"659\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/ron-galella-photos-04.jpg?w=659\" alt=\"Jackie Onassis on Madison Avenue in New York City on October 7, 1971.\" \/>Jackie Kennedy Onassis on Madison Avenue in New York City on Oct. 7, 1971.Ron Galella\/WireImage.com    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"815\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/ron-galella-photos-06.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Ron Galella wore a helmet in 1974 while photographing Marlon Brando.\" \/>Ron Galella wore a helmet in 1974 while photographing Marlon Brando.Ron Galella\/WireImage.com    <\/p>\n<p>While memorable, Galella\u2019s Jackie O portraits, which he obtained during a yearslong pursuit throughout New York City, landed him in a 1972 free-speech trial. Onassis said that he made her life \u201cintolerable, almost unlivable, with his constant surveillance\u201d and the paparazzo was slapped with a restraining order.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cJackie was my favorite subject,\u201d he told The Post about the 1979 shot. \u201cI had to keep 25 feet from her but in the museum I did break it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After he was caught breaking the restraining order four separate times, Galella was fined and ordered not to photograph Jackie or her children. His first book, \u201cJacqueline\u201d (1974), sold more than 10,000 copies.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"808\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/ron-galella-dies-02.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"The photog famously fought Jackie Kennedy in court.\" \/>The fotog famously fought Jackie Kennedy in court.Ron Galella Collection via Getty    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"761\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/ron-galella-photos-05.jpg?w=761\" \/>Elizabeth Taylor at the premiere party for \u201cA Flea in Her Ear\u201d at Les Ambassadeurs Restaurant in Paris shot by Galella.Ron Galella\/Wireimage.com    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"749\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/ron-galella-photos-03.jpg?w=749\" alt=\"Jack Nicholson during 43rd Annual Academy Awards' Governer's Ball at Beverly Hilton Hotel.\" \/>Jack Nicholson during the 43rd Annual Academy Awards\u2019 Governer\u2019s Ball at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.Ron Galella Collection via Getty    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cTo this day I cannot shoot Caroline,\u201d he told The Post in 2019. \u201cActually I could, but it\u2019s a risk.

Galella, who studied photojournalism at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California, famously was sucker-punched by Brando as he trailed him in Chinatown. While it ultimately lost him five teeth, he got a $40,000 settlement out of it \u2014 not to mention incredible stills.<\/p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t the only time Galella was subjected to violence over his methods either. Richard Burton\u2019s bodyguard also knocked out one of Gal\u00adella\u2019s teeth \u2014 though he lost a suit over that and was jailed in Cuernavaca, Mexico \u2014 while Elvis Presley\u2019s security slashed Ron\u2019s tires.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"812\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/ron-galella-photos-01.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Jerry Hall and Mick Jagger at Limelight in 1984, shot by Galella.\" \/>Jerry Hall and Mick Jagger at Limelight in 1984, shot by Galella.WireImage    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"817\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/ron-galella-dies-03.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Galella's career spanned over six decades, shooting every famous face imaginable.\" \/>Galella\u2019s career spanned over six decades, shooting every famous face imaginable.WireImage    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"690\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/ron-galella-photos-02.jpg?w=690\" alt=\"Robert Redford, shot by Galella.\" \/>Robert Redford, shot by Galella.Ron Galella\/Wireimage.com    <\/p>\n<p>Galella, who was a photographer in the Air Force during the Korean War, did have some fans, though, including Andy Warhol, who called Galella his \u201cfavorite photographer.\u201d We had the \u201csame social disease,\u201d Ron said of their celebrity obsessions.<\/p>\n<p>With countless photos, Galella and his wife, Betty Burke Galella, started the Ron Galella Ltd corporation in 1992 to safeguard his extensive photo library, seen in the 2010 documentary \u201cSmash His Camera.\u201d Galella also published several books with his work, including\u00a0\u201cDisco Years\u201d with Grace Jones\u2019 fierce face covering the photo art book.<\/p>\n<p>All of his photos weren\u2019t snapped through controversial methods, though.
