Ionescu&#8217;s first triple-double in the WNBA came in May 2021.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care about the triple-double; we didn&#8217;t win,&#8221; Ionescu said Sunday. &#8220;I&#8217;m just trying to do my part, continuing to get better every single day, continuing to learn from my teammates, from this coaching staff.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/wnba\/story\/_\/id\/34081568\/\" \/>Sabrina Ionescu is just the fourth player &#8212; and the youngest &#8212; in WNBA history to have multiple triple-doubles in her career.\u00a0Evan Yu\/NBAE via Getty Images<\/p>\n<p>However, Ionescu&#8217;s feats are impressing others. She nearly had a triple-double in the Liberty&#8217;s win over Minnesota on Tuesday &#8212; 26 points, eight rebounds, eight assists despite sitting out all of the fourth quarter &#8212; and she has been the catalyst for New York during its recent 4-2 run following a seven-game losing streak. Ionescu has averaged 24.0 points, 6.8 rebounds and 6.5 assists in those six games.<\/p>\n<p>Asked what has helped elevate Ionescu&#8217;s game, Liberty coach Sandy Brondello said, &#8220;Just a lot of confidence and knowing that we believe in her. She&#8217;s a great player out there, and she&#8217;s going to get better and better.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Ionescu joins Chicago&#8217;s Candace Parker as the only players who have had multiple triple-doubles in WNBA regular-season games, with Parker getting her second on May 22, at the age of 36. Parker&#8217;s first was in 2017, when she played for the Los Angeles Sparks.<\/p>\n<p>Parker&#8217;s Sky teammate Courtney Vandersloot and retired player Sheryl Swoopes are the only other WNBA players who have had multiple career triple-doubles, including playoff games. For Vandersloot, they came in the postseason last year and the regular season in 2018. For Swoopes, they were in 1999 (regular season) and 2005 (playoffs).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>6:06 PM ETMechelle VoepelESPN.com CloseMechelle Voepel covers the WNBA, women&#8217;s college basketball, and other college sports for espnW.
