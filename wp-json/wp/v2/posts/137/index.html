M. Spencer Green    <\/p>\n<p>In 2008, the conditions of the jail apparently were so bad that the United States Department of Justice conducted an investigation and released a report that found that the jail had \u201cfailed to adequately protect inmates from harm or risk of harm from other inmates or staff; failed to provide adequate suicide prevention; failed to provide adequate sanitary environmental conditions; failed to provide adequate fire safety precautions; and failed to provide adequate medical and mental health care.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The report also claimed that inmates had been forced to sleep on cell floors due to overcrowding, which led to a class-action lawsuit and a settlement.<\/p>\n<p>In a more recent incident, in 2018, a huge, violent brawl broke out and dozens of inmates were injured.<\/p>\n<p>According to Chicago\u2019s Human Rights Authority, approximately 100,000 people circulate through the jail annually. The daily population averages 7,500, mainly people detained awaiting trial and not yet convicted.<\/p>\n<p>Situated on a colossal 96 acres of land, the jail is considered the \u201clargest single-site jail in the country,\u201d the its website states. It is composed of 10 divisions, with each including a day room for eating and watching television. There is also a health-services facility, a privatized food service and commissary section, and four on-site sheriff departments.<\/p>\n<p>Smollett, who was convicted of five felonies, including lying to police about a hate crime, was placed in the Division 8 section of the jail \u2014 the residential treatment unit, or RTU, which is usually reserved for inmates with injuries or illness.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/jussie-smollett-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"This booking photo provided by the Cook County Sheriff's Office shows Jussie Smollett.\" \/>Smollett in a booking photo provided by the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s OfficeAP    <\/p>\n<p>In a statement to The Post, a representative for the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office said that while Smollett \u201cis not being held in solitary confinement\u201d \u2014 a practice \u201cabolished\u201d at the jail in 2016 \u2014 the performer \u201cis being housed in his own cell, which is monitored by security cameras in the cell and by an officer wearing a body-worn camera who is stationed at the entrance of the cell to ensure that Mr. Smollett is under direct observation at all times. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs with all detained persons, Mr. Smollett is entitled to have substantial time out of his cell in the common areas on the tier where he is housed, where he is able to use the telephone, watch television, and interact with staff,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cDuring such times out of cell, other detainees will not be present in the common areas.
