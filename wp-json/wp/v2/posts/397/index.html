The most bizarre moment, however, came at the very end of their quarantine when, while waiting for their free taxi home, a staffer pulled them aside and informed them they were to receive a present.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey were like, \u2018The taxi driver needs to go, but we do have a parting gift for you if you want to collect it,\u2019 \u201d Szabo recalled. \u201cAt this point I was so tired of being here but [I thought], \u2018Ok, fine, whatever this parting gift is, cool.\u2019 So I drop my bags in the taxi, and they lead me over to this table that is just full of Coach purses.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/02\/Sam-Szabo-2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"covid hotel coach bag\" \/>Sam Szabo with their gifted Coach bag in front of the LaGuardia Plaza Hotel, where they quarantined when they had Covid.Stefano Giovannini    <\/p>\n<p>There were racks of Coach heels, loafers, and a variety of bag options to choose from. Szabo picked out a purse, at which point a staffer asked them to take photos with it for social media before they left \u2014 bag to reality, saddled with swag.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTo go from something that\u2019s so liminal \u2014 a hotel but with hospital amenities, very spartan, efficient and clean, absolutely no luxury \u2014 and then walk out with a purse was a surprise,\u201d said Szabo of the experience. \u201cNow, I have this Coach purse. It\u2019s a really good icebreaker story.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Szabo was not alone in receiving the generous, if bizarre, gift after taking advantage of the isolation program.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs you are leaving, they sort out your laundry, and then they tell you, you have a gift that is coming to you from Coach, which is the funniest thing ever \u2014 why would you receive a gift for this whole thing?\u201d recalled a 34-year-old small business owner who spoke on the condition of anonymity and stayed at the same hotel as Szabo near the end of August. \u201cYou take the lift to the lobby, and just as you\u2019re being discharged, there\u2019s a pile of Coach bags behind a retractable rope and you walk up and pick whatever you want and somebody behind the rope hands it to you.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The Queens native, who currently lives in California, was visiting family at the time he contracted the coronavirus. He chose an accessory \u201calong the lines of a wallet clutch,\u201d which he ended up gifting to his brother\u2019s girlfriend.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/02\/Sam-Szabo.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"covid hotel coach bag\" \/>Szabo\u2019s bag isn\u2019t currently available on Coach\u2019s website, but similarly sized bags retail in the approximately $300 range.Stefano Giovannini    <\/p>\n<p>Overall, he found the handbag handout a hilarious cherry on top of an inspiringly generous and well-managed municipal program. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift already that the city takes care of you to this extent during this crisis, and on top of this, you get rewarded for it.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>When he got COVID a second time, months later, he went to another coronavirus quarantine hotel and \u201chad the same great experience, but we weren\u2019t offered any gifts at the end \u2014 not that there\u2019s reason to complain.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In response to The Post\u2019s request for comment regarding why random quarantine hotel residents were receiving designer gear, Coach was quick to explain: The bags were a strange but sweet part of a more than $2 million community-support initiative launched through the Coach Foundation by the luxury brand house Tapestry. A press release about the initiative from April 2020 \u2014 when New York City was the global epicenter of the pandemic \u2014 brims with the passionate intensity of charitable donation announcements in those early plague days, and focuses on the hundreds of thousands of dollars in emergency funds being given to front-line workers and the repurposing of Tapestry\u2019s New York-based 3D printers for the manufacturing of medical equipment.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>An NYC Health + Hospitals representative clarified that the free bags were part of a more recent initiative, in March 2021, when the Coach Foundation offered to make a one-time corporate donation of Coach goods to New Yorkers who had received COVID-related care in the city\u2019s public hospital system. Most of these goods ended up being given away to isolation hotel guests, the rep added.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are thankful to Coach for their generous gift to lift the spirits of New Yorkers recovering from COVID-19 or in quarantine at a NYC Test &amp; Trace Corps Take Care hotel,\u201d the rep told The Post in a statement. \u201cThey, like so many caring New Yorkers, were there to support those hardest hit by COVID-19.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>New York City\u2019s quarantine hotel program is no roach motel, former residents report \u2014 and the gift bags were positively luxurious.\u00a0 In fact, it\u2019s more appropriate to call the free, taxpayer-funded isolation&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":398,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[7],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/397"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=397"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/397\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=397"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=397"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=397"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
