But Scarlett and Gj\u00f8vik, who were employed by Apple at the time, both made the risky decision to speak publicly.<\/p>\n<p>Scarlett focused largely on pay equity, remote work and transparency issues at Apple, while Gj\u00f8vik spoke out about health concerns related to an Apple office having been built on a Superfund site, as well as Apple\u2019s privacy policies. Both women also said they had experienced harassment at work. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"322\" height=\"559\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/cher-scarlett-site2.jpg?w=322\" alt=\"Cher Scarlett \" \/>#AppleToo co-founder Cher Scarlett    <\/p>\n<p>As some of the only faces associated with the campaign, Scarlett and Gj\u00f8vik built substantial followings online and were covered by outlets including the Wall Street Journal, Washington Post and New York Times, which dubbed #AppleToo the main example of \u201cemployee unrest\u201d at Apple that \u201cwould have been unthinkable a few years ago.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>But behind the scenes and eventually in public, Scarlett and Gj\u00f8vik had a falling-out involving claims of stalking, leaking confidential information and even secretly working on behalf of Apple. The dispute culminated in Gj\u00f8vik labeling Scarlett an \u201cevil witch\u201d and Scarlett receiving a restraining order against Gj\u00f8vik, court papers show. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that a petty disagreement exploded into full-scale harassment and that the other party just didn\u2019t take the time to try to work it out or just move on and be an adult,\u201d Scarlett told The Post. \u201cTo me, there\u2019s no reason that this should\u2019ve happened and we should all be focused on holding corporations accountable, not tearing each other down.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Gj\u00f8vik told The Post she\u2019s \u201cnot legally allowed\u201d to talk about Scarlett\u2019s accusations until 2027 due to the court order but said she remains dedicated to fighting for justice against Apple.<\/p>\n<p>Apple did not respond to a request for comment.  <\/p>\n<h2>Leak allegations<\/h2>\n<p>Shortly after #AppleToo was formed last summer, Gj\u00f8vik had a series of disagreements with Scarlett and other members of the group. Some got the impression that Gj\u00f8vik was trying to use their stories to bolster her own case against Apple, rather than support \u201ccollective action,\u201d according to court testimony from Scarlett viewed by The Post.\u00a0Gj\u00f8vik then left the group.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In September, Apple fired Gj\u00f8vik for allegedly leaking intellectual property to a reporter \u2014 an accusation Gj\u00f8vik denied and has appealed through complaints with the National Labor Relations Board and Department of Labor.<\/p>\n<p>However, Scarlett claims in court papers that prior to Gj\u00f8vik\u2019s termination, Gj\u00f8vik had privately admitted to leaking information to a reporter from The Verge for a story about Apple collecting personal data on their own employees in the process of testing products like Face ID. <\/p>\n<p>When Gj\u00f8vik accused Apple of wrongly firing her, Scarlett called out Gj\u00f8vik through a post on corporate message board Blind, writing that it would be difficult for Gj\u00f8vik to argue she was wrongly fired since she had indeed leaked intellectual property.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Apple attorneys then cited Scarlett in their legal defense against Gj\u00f8vik\u2019s labor complaints, according to Gj\u00f8vik, leading Gj\u00f8vik to write on Twitter that her former collaborator was being \u201ca defense witness for Apple against me.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s in active communication helping Apple in their campaign of harassment, threats, &amp; horror against their safety whistleblower,\u201d Gj\u00f8vik claimed.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Scarlett later apologized to Gj\u00f8vik for posting about her on Blind but maintains that she never worked with Apple as a defense witness and did not intend to be cited in Apple\u2019s defense.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2>\u2018Blacklisting\u2019\u00a0<\/h2>\n<p>The same month that Gj\u00f8vik was fired from Apple, Scarlett took leave from the company due to what she said was harassment from colleagues and strangers online in response to her activism, including from another Blind user who \u201cdoxxed\u201d her by posting her contact information and former name, which she had changed years prior due to safety concerns.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Scarlett returned to Apple in November, but said that many of her colleagues still embraced the company\u2019s \u201cself-policing\u201d culture and ostracized her because they did not support her speaking out against the company. She negotiated a settlement with Apple and left the company that month.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI felt like it didn\u2019t get better,\u201d Scarlett told Slate at the time. \u201cI felt like it got worse. I was met with an immovable force.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>As Scarlett and #AppleToo\u2019s clashes with Apple received more media coverage, Scarlett claims that Gj\u00f8vik got jealous because her whistleblower claims were receiving less attention.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cShe was on a path to get a lot of media attention, but outlets struggled to corroborate her story, which kept changing over time,\u201d Scarlett testified in court in King County, Washington. \u201cI was profiled in the Washington Post and the Seattle Times, and she grew more agitated.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Gj\u00f8vik claimed that the real reason she wasn\u2019t being covered more in the press is that Scarlett had secretly \u201cblacklisted\u201d her by urging reporters to avoid speaking to her.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"999\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/ashley-gjovik-linkedin.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Ashley Gj\u00f8vik\" \/>Ashley Gj\u00f8vik was fired from Apple in September after the company accused her of leaking intellectual property. Linkedin\/Ashley Gj\u00f8vik    <\/p>\n<h2>Overdose<\/h2>\n<p>In December, Scarlett published a blog post bashing \u201ca few\u201d unnamed women for harassing her, including by editing her Wikipedia page and posting about her online.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey determined I had slighted them all in some way, and quite possibly most hilariously, have some warped idea that I am controlling the press,\u201d Scarlett wrote in what appeared to be a thinly veiled jab at Gj\u00f8vik.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Gj\u00f8vik flipped the script, claiming that Scarlett had actually edited Gj\u00f8vik\u2019s Wikipedia page through anonymous accounts.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Scarlett, a recovering addict, wrote that the harassment \u2014 along with her clashes with Apple \u2014 was so distressing that it caused her to relapse. She said that she had taken a pill that she said looked like a Percocet but actually contained Fentanyl, sending her \u201calmost immediately into cardiac arrest.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m alive after two doses of Narcan, 8 minutes of CPR, and a defibrillator jolt to my chest,\u201d Scarlett wrote, requesting donations to a GoFundMe fundraiser for legal and medical expenses.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/apple-iphone_research.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Apple\" \/>The #AppleToo movement accused Apple of overlooking gender and racial discrimination, sexual harassment and other ills.REUTERS    <\/p>\n<h2>Restraining Order<\/h2>\n<p>Weeks after Scarlett\u2019s overdose, Gj\u00f8vik published a series of tweets calling Scarlett a \u201cpsycho\u201d and an \u201cevil witch,\u201d according to screenshots Scarlett included in court papers. Gj\u00f8vik also accused Scarlett of secretly being paid by Apple to try to orchestrate a \u201charassment &amp; defamation\u201d campaign to \u201ctry to get me to give up\/kill myself,\u201d the screenshots show. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The same month, Scarlett reported Gj\u00f8vik to the FBI\u2019s internet crimes division, according to her court testimony. <\/p>\n<p>Then in early February, Gj\u00f8vik published an \u201cevidence report\u201d about Scarlett online. It included excerpts of Scarlett\u2019s online posts as well as what Scarlett said was personal information about her husband, child and other family members.<\/p>\n<p>In response, Scarlett filed a request for a restraining order in a Washington state court.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMs. Gj\u00f8vik has one goal: to destroy me publicly,\u201d Scarlett testified. \u201cPlease help me find relief from the fear of my well-being, and the safety of myself, my child and the rest of my family.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In a legal filing, Gj\u00f8vik again claimed that Scarlett was actually the one who was \u201cpersistently attempting to harm, harass, defame, intimidate, and coerce\u201d her. Scarlett\u2019s request for a restraining order was, in Gj\u00f8vik\u2019s telling, yet another example of her harassment.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>But on March 1, a judge in King county sided with Scarlett, granting a five-year restraining order against Gj\u00f8vik. It bars Gj\u00f8vik from speaking publicly about Scarlett and from coming within 1,000 feet of her, among other measures. <\/p>\n<p>Gj\u00f8vik has filed an appeal that\u2019s set to be heard in Washington state superior court this August. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy lawyer and I already submitted an appeal, as this order violates my First Amendment Rights and the State of Washington court lacked jurisdiction to issue such an order against an out of state respondent,\u201d Gj\u00f8vik told The Post.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI did receive notice that Ashley is appealing it in the court proceeding,\u201d Scarlett said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that another judge will find that there was any mistake in that proceeding.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI would\u2019ve preferred that none of this became the subject of the media,\u201d she added. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A pair of ex-Apple employees who made headlines last year for leading a whistleblower movement against the company have since become embroiled in a bizarre legal fight, accusing each other of harassment&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":1113,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[14],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1112"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1112"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1112\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1112"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1112"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1112"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
