Bloomberg via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you don\u2019t want to wear a big, bulky sweater and a blazer is too formal, a vest is that easy answer,\u201d said image consultant and fashion stylist Amanda Sanders, who recently styled a few male executive clients in Peter Millar\u2019s $200 reversible quilted takes on the trends. Sanders noted that some clients especially love the vest because it conceals the infamous \u201cdad bod\u201d or any pounds packed on during the pandemic. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cA vest hides a multitude of sins \u2014 if it\u2019s something darker it\u2019s going to make you look slimmer and hide that belly,\u201d she said.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Vests are currently ubiquitous at retailers all over New York City.
