On college campuses, late-night food is a thing and is the trend. We can drive in any weather conditions- rain, shine or snow,\u201d Chris Neider, director of business development at Starship Technologies, said.<\/p>\n<p>The battery-powered robots use sidewalks and other pedestrian-friendly paths to deliver their orders, mostly free of operator interaction, but routes can occasionally be interrupted.<\/p>\n<p>A downed tree from a storm or even a scooter that wasn\u2019t returned to its proper home can cause issues and force the robot to phone home for help.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFirst, it is going to try to maneuver. It\u2019s going to try to figure out if there is a pathway around the object,\u201d Neider stated.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/starship-robot-food-delivery-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Lucky California supermarket store Director, Mario Guerrero loads grocery bags into the hull of a Starship Technologies robot before the robot heads out for delivery in Pleasanton, California.\" \/>Lucky California supermarket store Director, Mario Guerrero loads grocery bags into the hull of a Starship Technologies robot before the robot heads out for delivery in Pleasanton, California.EPA    <\/p>\n<p>The company said it is rare that an operator needs to get involved, but one is available and nearby if assistance is needed.<\/p>\n<p>Neider warned that the robots have limitations and, like all delivery services, can\u2019t handle large snowfalls or other significant events.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/starship-robot-food-delivery-4.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Starship Technologies has hundreds of machines from coast to coast that deliver food and other items through an ordering app.\" \/>Starship Technologies has hundreds of machines from coast to coast that deliver food and other items through an ordering app.Starship    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe robot does not have a plow on it, so there are limitations.
