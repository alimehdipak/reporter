You got to do a lot of manscaping,\u201d he confessed matter-of-factly. \u201cIt makes everything look cleaner and better. And no one wants to see a big, hairy a \u2013 -, you know? I usually do keep everything kind of clean . . . but you have to kind of take it to the next level on Chippendales.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s no wonder he\u2019s going to greater grooming lengths. His \u201cnext-level\u201d performance will include a sultry, soaking-wet shower scene in which he\u2019ll brandish his bodacious buns while wearing only a \u201csock\u201d to cover his manhood. It\u2019s a now-viral stunt he did on his last visit there in 2019, which was witnessed by several \u201cJersey Shore\u201d castmates, including Pauly D, Jenni \u201cJWoww\u201d Farley, Deena Nicole Buckner and Ronnie Ortiz-Magro \u2014 and even Guadagnino\u2019s mother, Paula, who was full of pride and brought to tears watching her son strip and saunter.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>Now he\u2019s ready to suit up \u2014 or, rather, strip down \u2014 for Vegas vixens looking to party. <\/p>\n<p>And if his mom can appreciate the party, so can he.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s entertaining. It\u2019s fun. It\u2019s kind of like a party . . . You\u2019re going to see twerking, you\u2019re going to see humping,\u201d he said of the \u201cinteractive\u201d show, during which some lucky audience members have a chance to engage with dancers \u2014 including him \u2014 onstage. \u201cIt feels good. You know, you rip your shirt off and it\u2019s, like, the loudest screams you ever heard in your life. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely wild!\u201d <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Vinny Guadagnino doesn\u2019t mind this work grind.
