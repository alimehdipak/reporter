They are who you will usually see unless the <a href=\"https:\/\/blogbuzzer.weebly.com\/blog\/what-is-a-pediatric-dentist-pharr-tx\">dentist<\/a> has the time to do the procedures. However, you will also see your dentist for a few minutes before you leave so they can do a final check and ensure the dental assistant hasn\u2019t missed anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dentists will also conduct x-rays and fluoride treatments as well as discuss any findings that the dental assistant noticed.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why are regular teeth cleanings important?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having your teeth checked and cleaned by your dentist is critical to maintaining a healthy mouth, teeth, and gums. Your dentist will notice things you do not and can help prevent damage to the mouth overall. They will also be able to talk with you about concerns you may have such as:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tooth\/gum sensitivity<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pain in the gums<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bite misalignments<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abrasions or abscesses inside the mouth<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Potential cavities<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How often should you get your teeth cleaned by your dentist?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should see your dentist every 6-12 months pending your oral conditions. If you have a relatively healthy mouth, you can likely see your dentist once per year and maintain that status! However, if you notice anything new such as unexpected pain or sensitivity, you should make an appointment to see your dentist to avoid further damage to the area.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At what age should you start seeing a dentist?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dentists often start seeing patients as young as 6 months old. This is to ensure that there are no obvious signs of oral complications. They can also predict future problems that may occur and what to watch out for in your <a href=\"https:\/\/6001591e016b5.site123.me\/blog\/why-you-should-take-your-child-to-a-pediatric-dentist-in-edinburg-tx\">child<\/a>. From there, you should be seeing a dentist every 6-12 months.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How long does a usual dental cleaning procedure take?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pending what you need done during your routine dental cleaning, the appointment can take anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes. Typically, a routine cleaning without any added procedures will only take half an hour and end with you getting a sticker or a new toothbrush!<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>During a routine tooth cleaning, your dentist or dental assistant will have you lay in the automatic chair for the duration of the appointment.
