It\u2019s nothing new, and it\u2019ll happen in the metaverse,\u201d said Greg Pryor, a lawyer at the\u00a0lawfirm Reed Smith LLP.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBut if I say something racist or abuse someone based on their race or religion or sexuality, then you can potentially be prosecuted.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/metaverse-1-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"UNSPECIFIED - MARCH 24: General views of the Metaverse Fashion Week on March 24, 2022 in UNSPECIFIED, Unspecified.
