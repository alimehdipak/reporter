It didn\u2019t go out in the U.S. until around Feb 2020, so there was quite a gap,\u201d executive producer Belinda Campbell told The Post.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAlready in the U.K., there was a big fan base going, \u2018There has to be a Season 2!\u2019 So, when ITV announced that there wasn\u2019t going to be one, [Masterpiece PBS] was determined to help us\u2026.As soon as it became clear that it had done well in the U.S., that galvanized us. It took a fair amount of time after that to get the money together. Throughout this process, I was talking to the cast. There were moments where we thought it was going to happen, and then the money fell through, or Theo said he wasn\u2019t coming back. It was a bit of a roller coaster.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/Sanditon_Rose_Williams_as_Charlotte_Heywood.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" \/>Rose Williams as Charlotte Heywood goes to a quaint seaside resort to expand her horizons in \u201cSanditon.\u201d Red Planet Pictures \/ ITV    <\/p>\n<p>Based on an unfinished Jane Austen novel of the same name, \u201cSanditon,\u201d is set in the early 1800s England. Season 1 follows Charlotte Heywood (Rose Williams), who travels to the seaside resort of Sanditon. There, she meets a slew of colorful characters including her surly love interest Sidney Parker (Theo James), his entrepreneur brother Tom (Kris Marshall), West Indian heiress and Jane Austen\u2019s first black heroine, Georgiana Lambe (Crystal Clarke) and sassy Lady Denham (Anne Reid). She also learns about threats to the resort\u2019s funding.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Season 1 ended on a cliffhanger separating Charlotte and Sidney\u00a0 \u2013 and after it was announced that the show\u2019s cancellation was reversed, Theo James announced in May 2021 that he wouldn\u2019t return.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/TCDSAND_PB004.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" \/>Theo James as Sidney Parker isn\u2019t returning for Season 2 of \u201cSanditon.\u201d \u00a9PBS\/Courtesy Everett Collectio    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe never signed an option, so he was never obliged to come back, but we had talked about it. But I think he genuinely believed that it was an interesting ending \u2013 he\u2019s a creative. So that\u2019s the fundamental reason why [he didn\u2019t return] and he was busy with other work,\u201d said Campbell, who\u2019s also the head of Drama at Red Planet (the production company behind the show).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAll of Austen\u2019s stories have a love interest, but they are primarily about the female protagonist. This is Charlotte Heywood\u2019s story. If Rose [Williams] hadn\u2019t come back, that would have been really problematic. So, I\u2019m not diminishing the loss of Theo, but it\u2019s her story. She\u2019s the girl who comes to this glamorous resort with plans to live a life less ordinary, and has this huge love affair with this person that makes a difference in her life. But that ends in heartbreak, as many first loves do.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSeries 2 and 3 are about that continuation of her journey as a young woman. The producers all thought Theo was brilliant, so that was a setback. But when obstacles arise, opportunities arise, because you find new ways around them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/Sanditon_S2_early_release_lowres1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Charlotte Heywood (Rose Williams) stands in a ballroom opposite a man, dancing with his back to the camera. \" \/>Charlotte Heywood (Rose Williams) dances with a mystery man in \u201cSanditon\u201d Season 2.
