After her abusive husband dies, she\u2019s free to pursue the life she wants. Intrigued by newspaper reports of a \u201csea dragon\u201d sighted in Essex, she travels there to investigate, she\u2019s convinced that the serpent could be a real creature that escaped evolution.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/claire-danes-tom-hiddleston-2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Claire Danes smiles and cries while wearing a hat. \" \/>Claire Danes as Cora and Tom Hiddleston as Will in \u201cThe Essex Serpent.\u201d Apple TV+.    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/the-essex-serpent-tom-hiddleston-4.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Claire Danes and Tom Hiddleston stroll on a beach. \" \/>Taking a stroll: Cora (Claire Danes) and Will (Tom Hiddleston) in \u201cThe Essex Serpent.\u201d Apple TV+.    <\/p>\n<p>There, she stays with the local vicar, Will Ransome (Hiddleston) and his wife, Stella (Clemence Poesy, \u201cHarry Potter\u201d). She connects with Will, even though he disapproves of the mass belief in the serpent and is determined to convince everyone that it\u2019s not real. Although Cora and Will represent a typical \u201cfaith versus science\u201d argument, they\u2019re polite about their differences, and this plays out more like a dance between them than a true fierce clash. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Cora, things become complicated when a local girl turns up dead, and, because Cora is an outsider enthusiastic about finding the serpent, the villagers view her with suspicion. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/the-essex-serpent-claire-danes.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Claire Danes in a wig. \" \/>Claire Danes as Cora, a Victorian era widow with an interest in natural science, in \u201cThe Essex Serpent.\u201d Apple TV+.    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/the-essex-serpent-tom-hiddleston-2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Tom Hiddleston wears a vicar outfit. \" \/>Will Ransome (Tom Hiddleston) is the local vicar in \u201cThe Essex Serpent.\u201d Apple TV+.    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Essex Serpent\u201d is hard to categorize. It\u2019s got elements of mystery and a death that sparks a series of events, but it\u2019s not a \u201cwhodunit.\u201d It\u2019s got interpersonal drama, since Will and Cora forge an emotional bond that goes past the boundaries of propriety, despite the fact that Will is married \u2013 and, to complicate matters, Cora\u2019s friend from London, the ambitious and slightly smarmy young surgeon Luke Garrett (Frank Dillane), has the hots for her. He\u2019s dismayed to see her going off to Essex in what he sees as a foolish endeavor and a waste of time.<\/p>\n<p>The show\u2019s romantic elements are understated; the series isn\u2019t a bodice- ripper like \u201cBridgerton\u201d or \u201cOutlander.\u201d And it\u2019s probably got too much Victorian-era surgery scenes to appeal to fans of those shows (or of lighter period-piece fare such as \u201cThe Gilded Age\u201d). Audiences who liked the Clive Owen series \u201cThe Knick\u201d or the underrated 19th century murder tale series \u201cAlias Grace\u201d will enjoy it.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/claire-danes-tom-hiddleston-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Claire Danes and Tom Hiddleston smile at each other on a beach. \" \/>Cora (Claire Danes) and Will (Tom Hiddleston) take a stroll in the marshes in \u201cThe Essex Serpent.\u201d Apple TV+    <\/p>\n<p>The show also has a prominent focus on the nature of superstition in an insular community, with characters conversing about Marxism and Socialism. For the most part, all of these disparate plotlines and themes blend well together. Tonally, it isn\u2019t as messy as it could be \u2014 an impressive feat, considering the scattered nature of these topics.<\/p>\n<p>But the narrative does feel meandering. \u201cThe Essex Serpent\u201d is part of the age-old \u201csomething spooky might be happening in this remote coastal area\u201d genre most recently exemplified by \u201cMidnight Mass,\u201d but it\u2019s not as sharp or suspenseful as that series, since it\u2019s less committed to a particular category.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/the-essex-serpent-tom-hiddleston-3.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Tom Hiddleston is bedraggled standing outside. \" \/>Tom Hiddleston as a bedraggled Will in \u201cThe Essex Serpent.\u201d Apple TV+.    <\/p>\n<p>Hiddleston and Danes both turn in predictably solid performances. Danes bristles with a steely-eyed determination, while Hiddleston neatly sidesteps giving Will \u201csmall town vicar\u201d clich\u00e9 traits and infuses him with a thoughtful air.<\/p>\n<p>The show is moody, with lots of picturesque shots of rivers, bridges, cobblestone streets, and marshlands in the English countryside. It\u2019s not self-serious, but it also doesn\u2019t have much levity or humor.<\/p>\n<p>For those looking for a period drama that feels focused and tightly plotted, this will likely disappoint. But, for viewers who don\u2019t mind a sprawling show that\u2019s odd and unique, with a heavy dose of Victorian-era science and intellect, \u201cThe Essex Serpent\u201d delivers.\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cThe Essex Serpent,\u201d starring Tom Hiddleston and Claire Danes, is an intriguing drama that likely won\u2019t be for everyone \u2026 but it rewards those who don\u2019t mind a show that\u2019s strange and&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":2989,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[5],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2988"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/6"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2988"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2988\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2988"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2988"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2988"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
