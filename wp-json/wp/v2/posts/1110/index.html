It makes it hard for me to accept that when he&#8217;s committed himself to a different take on everything. It&#8217;s hard to figure out where he&#8217;s standing. You&#8217;ve got to check him out every time.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Abdul-Jabbar, on hand to present James&#8217; teammate, Carmelo Anthony, with the newly designed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Trophy to honor Anthony as the NBA&#8217;s Social Justice Champion for the 2020-21 season, has already voiced his disappointment in James several times this season.<\/p>\n<p>After James celebrated a late-game 3 in an overtime win against the Indiana Pacers by mimicking the dance that former NBA All-Star Sam Cassell made popular, accentuating his nether regions, Abdul-Jabbar was pointed in his disapproval.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/photo\/2021\/1223\/r954615_1296x1296_1-1.jpg&amp;w=130&amp;h=130&amp;scale=crop&amp;location=center\" width=\"65\" height=\"65\" \/><\/li>\n<li><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/photo\/2021\/1019\/r925029_1296x1296_1-1.jpg&amp;w=130&amp;h=130&amp;scale=crop&amp;location=center\" width=\"65\" height=\"65\" \/><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>1 Related<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;For me, winning is enough,&#8221; Abdul-Jabbar said in a video posted through Substack, a subscription commentary website, in early December. &#8220;Why do you need to do a stupid, childish dance and disrespect the other team on the court? It doesn&#8217;t make sense. GOATs don&#8217;t dance.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Later that month, Abdul-Jabbar took aim at James once again after the four-time MVP shared a Spider-Man meme to his Instagram account showing three identical Spider-Man characters pointing at one another, affixed with the labels &#8220;COVID,&#8221; &#8220;cold,&#8221; and &#8220;flu.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Abdul-Jabbar wrote on Substack that the social media post was a &#8220;blow to his worthy legacy&#8221; because the &#8220;implication is that LeBron doesn&#8217;t understand the difference among these three illnesses, even after all the information that&#8217;s presented in the press.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Abdul-Jabbar referenced both of his prior critiques on Sunday in explaining his stance on the 19-year veteran.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Absolutely, [I have] a higher expectation for him because he understands the issues and spoken to them quite forcefully and eloquently,&#8221; Abdul-Jabbar said. &#8220;I think he has so much going for him in terms of respect and accomplishment and he shouldn&#8217;t stoop to those moments.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>James dismissed Abdul-Jabbar&#8217;s criticism at the time.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have a response to Kareem at all,&#8221; James said. &#8220;And if you saw the post and you read the tag, you&#8217;re literally, honestly asking, &#8216;Help me out?&#8217; Help me kind of figure it all out. We&#8217;re all trying to figure this pandemic out.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Abdul-Jabbar said his and James&#8217; in-person interactions have only been brief, but he would welcome a further connection.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If he would take the time, I definitely got the time,&#8221; Abdul-Jabbar said. &#8220;I admire the things that he&#8217;s done that have gotten all our attention. Sending a whole school to college? Wow. That&#8217;s amazing. His thoughtfulness and willingness to back it up with his wallet, you got to give him credit for that. So I&#8217;m not throwing stones. I just wish he wouldn&#8217;t &#8212; you know, some of the things he&#8217;s done, he should be embarrassed about. That&#8217;s just where I&#8217;m coming from.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Despite that standpoint, Abdul-Jabbar welcomes James&#8217; pursuit of his NBA scoring record, which he has held for almost 38 years after he eclipsed Wilt Chamberlain&#8217;s previous career scoring total.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all for him doing it,&#8221; Abdul-Jabbar said. &#8220;There&#8217;s no envy there. &#8230; Just &#8212; with the issues I was talking about, things that really affect the Black community, he should be careful. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;m asking.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>LOS ANGELES &#8212; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar publicly criticized LeBron James once again Sunday, with the Los Angeles Lakers legend saying he believes the current Lakers star has a greater responsibility in how he conducts himself given his elevated platform.&#8221;Some of the things he&#8217;s done and said are really beneath him, as far as I can see,&#8221;&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":1111,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[13],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1110"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1110"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1110\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1110"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1110"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1110"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
