There will also be no silverware to look forward to either, after home defeats in the FA Cup (Middlesbrough) and Champions League (Atletico Madrid) ended their involvement in those competitions since Rangnick took over from Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.<\/p>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p>Underperforming players including Paul Pogba, Marcus Rashford, Harry Maguire and yes, Cristiano Ronaldo, have all borne the brunt of criticism and blame for United&#8217;s dismal season, but Rangnick now deserves greater scrutiny because, to be blunt, he has done nothing more than bring more inconsistency and confusion to the club following the sacking of Solskjaer in November. He has made United better, and while Jadon Sancho has shown glimpses of his true self in recent weeks, and Anthony Elanga justified the manager&#8217;s faith, the former RP Leipzig coach has seen the likes of Maguire, Rashford and Ronaldo go backward.<\/p>\n<p>Results have also been poor. United have won just four of their past 11 games in all competitions and, since Jan 1, have failed to win six of their 10 games at Old Trafford.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the statistics, Rangnick has escaped much of the negativity surrounding the club, but a man with a reputation as one of the game&#8217;s great tactical thinkers has shown himself to be out of his depth at United. <em>&#8212; Ogden<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/soccer\/blog-espn-fc-united\/story\/4633385\/\" \/>play<\/p>\n<p>1:24<\/p>\n<p>Luis Garcia questions the decision to award Real Madrid three penalties in their 2-1 win against Celta Vigo.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/i\/teamlogos\/soccer\/500\/86.png\" width=\"50\" \/>Real Madrid aren&#8217;t letting LaLiga slip at this point<\/p>\n<p>Real Madrid scored two penalties and missed another one as they beat Celta Vigo 2-1 to disappoint any neutrals hoping for some late title drama in Spain. Defeat to Barcelona in the <em>Clasico<\/em> before the international break had slightly increased the pressure on the runaway leaders, but they returned to winning ways at Balaidos to maintain their 12-point lead at the top of LaLiga with eight games remaining.<\/p>\n<p>There might not be any drama at the summit, then, but there was plenty in Vigo on Saturday.<\/p>\n<p>Nolito had cancelled out Karim Benzema&#8217;s early penalty to leave the match delicately poised heading into the final 30 minutes. Benzema saw a second penalty saved by Matias Dituro, but he got another chance to earn the three points for Madrid just minutes later when the referee pointed to the spot for a third time, leaving Celta irate. Celta captain Aspas said the first two were &#8220;soft&#8221; and that the third one, for a foul by Kevin Vazquez on Ferland Mendy, was &#8220;never a penalty.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img data-src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2020\/0325\/r682826_2_1296x729_16-9.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2020\/0325\/r682826_2_1296x729_16-9.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines.

They didn&#8217;t just need to bounce back from the Barca loss to quell talks of a title race, but they did need a win after the international break to set them up for this week&#8217;s Champions League tie in London against Chelsea.<em>&#8212; Marsden<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/soccer\/500-dark\/124.png&amp;w=126&amp;site=espnfc\" width=\"50\" \/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/soccer\/500-dark\/11420.png&amp;w=126&amp;site=espnfc\" width=\"50\" \/>Clinical RB Leipzig crumbles Dortmund&#8217;s yellow wall<\/p>\n<p>For the first time in more than two years, the Yellow Wall at Borussia Dortmund&#8217;s Signal Iduna Park was full of people, and in a huge match &#8212; both for BVB&#8217;s flagging Bundesliga title chances and for RB Leipzig&#8217;s chances of a top-four finish &#8212; the home team came out on fire. Borussia Dortmund nearly went ahead in the seventh minute when Marco Reus misplayed a prime transition opportunity, but they overwhelmed RBL in the first 20 minutes, attempting five shots to the visitors&#8217; zero and tilting the field to the tune of 48 touches in the attacking third to RBL&#8217;s eight.<\/p>\n<p>Having weathered an early storm, however, RBL completely flipped the match around. Konrad Laimer dinked in a transition goal in the 21st minute, then scored off a deflection in the 30th. Christopher Nkunku put the match out of reach in the 58th minute, popping up to assist a late Dani Olmo goal. (For anyone keeping track, Nkunku&#8217;s got an incredible 27 goals and 14 assists in all competitions this season.)<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2021\/0105\/Article_Placement_1920x1080_AllSoccer_%20(1).jpg\" width=\"100%\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The beautiful game lives here.

It continued this weekend, too, as Napoli&#8217;s 3-1 win over Atalanta to draw level with Milan (who play Monday) was the prelude to a fiery, contentious Derby d&#8217;Italia in which Inter Milan won at red-hot Juventus to stay within reach of their rivals.<\/p>\n<p><b>&#8211; ESPN+ viewers&#8217; guide: LaLiga, Bundesliga, MLS, FA Cup, more<\/b><br \/><b>&#8211; Stream ESPN FC Daily on ESPN+ (U.S. only)<\/b><br \/><b>&#8211; Don&#8217;t have ESPN?

As if that wasn&#8217;t enough, even their game-winning penalty came with added chaos: after VAR determined Inter deserved a spot kick, Wojciech Szczesny saved Hakan Calhanoglou&#8217;s first attempt, only for VAR to award a retake deep in first-half injury time. Not all 1-0 games are created equal!<\/p>\n<p>Juve conspired to waste the lion&#8217;s share of scoring chances, with Giorgio Chiellini, Paulo Dybala and Dusan Vlahovic all squandering chances you&#8217;d expect them to convert 99 times out of 100. More remarkably, Inter snapped Juve&#8217;s brilliant run of form in Serie A, which had seen them not lose since Nov. 27 to slowly creep back up the table from seventh to being within a whisper of joining the title race.<\/p>\n<p>With Milan set to play mid-table Bologna on Monday, the table has the <em>Rossoneri<\/em>, Napoli and Inter separated by three points with eight rounds of games remaining.

Having played his first game in February since suffering a cardiac arrest while playing for Denmark at Euro 2020 last June, the midfielder scored his first Premier League goal in the remarkable 4-1 win at Chelsea.<\/p>\n<p>The 30-year-old has done so well for Thomas Frank&#8217;s team since his emotional comeback against Newcastle six weeks ago that his four appearances for the Bees have almost seemed routine. Yet his goal at Stamford Bridge was a reminder that every game he plays, and every goal he scores, is a testament not only to the skill of the medical team that saved his life and enabled him to even contemplate a return, but also to Eriksen&#8217;s incredible determination to not allow that dreadful incident in Copenhagen to be the moment that defines him.<\/p>\n<p>Inevitably, the latter is always likely to be the case, but Eriksen has somehow been able to ensure that he can still write new chapters on the football field, and his goal against Chelsea is another memorable one. <em>&#8212; Ogden<\/em><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>Christian Eriksen scores his first club goal since returning to soccer! <\/p>\n<p>Brentford lead 2-1.

The Barca midfielder received the ball just outside the box late in the second half and feigned to shoot on his left foot, sending Sevilla&#8217;s Ivan Rakitic flying in the other direction. Then he lined up on his right, only for another feint to take defender Diego Carlos out of the picture as well. When he finally did shoot, not even overworked goalkeeper Yassine Bounou could keep his shot out, which arrowed into the corner from 20 yards.<\/p>\n<p>With the 1-0 victory, Barca have now won six league games in a row and are unbeaten in 13 matches in all competitions.
