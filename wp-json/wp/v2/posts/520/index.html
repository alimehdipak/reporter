I was the brunette. I wasn\u2019t as cool as Gigi, not as outgoing,\u201d she told the magazine for its April cover story. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s really what people said about me. And unfortunately when you get told things so many times, you do just believe it \u2026 I always felt like I had something to prove. People can say anything about how I look, about how I talk, about how I act. But in seven years I never missed a job, canceled a job, was late to a job. No one can ever say that I don\u2019t work my ass off.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In the new issue, Hadid talks about her mental health struggles, anorexia, a litany of maladies including Lyme disease and, yes, finally admits going under the knife.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/bella-vogue-3.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=819\" alt=\"Bella Hadid covers the April issue of Vogue\" \/>Bella Hadid covers the April issue of VogueVogue   \t \t   <\/p>\n<p>\u201cPeople think I fully f \u2013 \u2013 ked with my face because of one picture of me as a teenager looking puffy. I\u2019m pretty sure you don\u2019t look the same now as you did at 13, right? I have never used filler. Let\u2019s just put an end to that. I have no issue with it, but it\u2019s not for me. Whoever thinks I\u2019ve gotten my eyes lifted or whatever it\u2019s called \u2014 it\u2019s face tape! The oldest trick in the book,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>But Hadid did acknowledge the procedure she did have done: a nose job she had when she was only 14.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI wish I had kept the nose of my ancestors,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I would have grown into it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Her father\u2019s side of the family is Palestinian-Jordanian and her mother Dutch. <\/p>\n<p>Hadid also divulged her numerous health issues. In the eighth grade, she started to experience symptoms including brain fog, anxiety, exhaustion, headaches, bone pain and crying spells, which came from Lyme disease. At 20, she was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and in high school was prescribed Adderall, which led to an eating disorder.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"849\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/bella-vogue.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=849\" alt=\"Bella Hadid shows off her toned midriff in this month's Vogue.\" \/>Bella Hadid shows off her toned midriff in this month\u2019s Vogue.    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was on this calorie-counting app, which was like the devil to me. I\u2019d pack my little lunch with my three raspberries, my celery stick,\u201d said Hadid, who realized it was less about calories and more about control. She no longer has disordered eating but feels the lingering effects of body dysmorphia and makes a point of avoiding mirrors.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In 2021, Hadid, who is dating art director Marc Kalman, experienced crippling depression, which led to a two-week stay at a facility in Tennessee. There she began talk therapy and taking the antidepressant Wellbutrin.<\/p>\n<p>She said: \u201cFor so long, I didn\u2019t know what I was crying about. I always felt so lucky, and that would get me even more down on myself \u2026 I always felt that I didn\u2019t have the right to complain, which meant that I didn\u2019t have the right to get help, which was my first problem.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It isn\u2019t easy being the younger sister \u2014 even when you are a supermodel who\u2019s appeared on countless magazines and fashion runways.
