The identity of the new owner isn\u2019t immediately clear.<\/p>\n<p>The home stands in affluent Brentwood, at 506 North Carmelina Ave., and it\u2019s where the \u201cGolden Girls\u201d titan lived at the time of her death this past New Year\u2019s Eve at age 99 \u2014 less than three weeks from her 100th birthday and less than a week after having a stroke. Following her death, fans gathered outside the property to pay their respects for the star, who entertained generations of viewers during the course of her more than 80-year career.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the charm of the standing home, a 1952-built structure accented with canary yellow shutters, the listing notes the property would be sold for land value, adding it affords a buyer the chance to build their dream home on a flat lot. What\u2019s more: prospective buyers couldn\u2019t get interior access to the home during visits. (The home, however, was known to have a room full of stuffed animals, due to her lifelong love of animals. It also has five bedrooms and 3,029 square feet of space.)<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/betty-white.jpg?w=768\" alt=\"White passed away on New Year's Eve at age 99.\" \/>White passed away on New Year\u2019s Eve at age 99.Getty Images    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/betty-white-house-sale-06.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"The charming spread was marketed as a teardown.\" \/>The charming spread was marketed as a teardown.Barcelo Photography for Sotheby\u2019s International Realty    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/betty-white-house-sale-04.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"The property stands behind gates in Brentwood.\" \/>The property stands behind gates in Brentwood.Barcelo Photography for Sotheby\u2019s International Realty    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/betty-white-house-sale-01.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"The grounds look to the Getty Museum and the mountains.\" \/>The grounds look to the Getty Museum and the mountains.PostRAIN Productions for Sotheby&#8217;s International Realty    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/betty-white-house-sale-07.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"White also had a pool surrounded by trees.\" \/>White also had a pool surrounded by trees.Barcelo Photography for Sotheby\u2019s International Realty    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/betty-white-house-sale-12.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Another shot of the pool.\" \/>Another shot of the pool.Barcelo Photography for Sotheby\u2019s International Realty    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/betty-white-house-sale-10.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"The house's privacy was a selling point.\" \/>The house\u2019s privacy was a selling point.Barcelo Photography for Sotheby\u2019s International Realty    <\/p>\n<p>The lot spans .72 acres, and looks to views of the Getty Museum and the nearby mountains.
