He has done fantastic,&#8221; Hamstra said ahead of Ajax&#8217;s 2-1 defeat to PSV Eindhoven in the Dutch Cup final.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We hope he stays. We have to stick with the facts, he has not left yet. He still is focusing on Ajax, so do we.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We did everything possible [to keep him at Ajax]. We were very busy with that. He reacted that he is focussing on Ajax now. Now we are preparing for two scenarios, Ten Hag might stay or might leave.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Ogden: How Man United selected Ten hag as their next manager<\/p>\n<h2>PAPER GOSSIP (by Nick Judd)<\/h2>\n<p>&#8211; Borussia Dortmund are pushing Manchester City for a decision on Erling Haaland, according to the Sun. They believe the German club want a decision as quickly as possible so they can plan for the 21-year-old striker&#8217;s replacement. Haaland has a \u00a364m release clause in his contract, which activates this summer, and Manchester City lead the race for his signature ahead of Real Madrid. Dortmund have not given up hope of persuading Haaland to stay, but with City boss Pep Guardiola reportedly desperate to land a striker, it looks as though this could finally be the summer in which the Norwegian moves on to pastures new.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Everton star Richarlison has instructed his agent to find him a new club at the end of the season, according to Football Insider. The 24-year-old is currently embroiled in a relegation battle as he looks to keep Everton in the Premier League, but whatever happens he appears keen to quit the club in search of Champions League football. The Brazilian forward has two years left on his existing contract, but despite crunch talks between the club and the player&#8217;s representatives, it looks as though he could be on the move at the end of the season.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Barcelona are keen to get Philippe Coutinho&#8217;s future sorted before June in order for them to sort out their finances, and their own squad improvements, reports Sport. The Catalan club are hoping to recoup \u20ac40m for the attacking midfielder, who is currently on loan at Aston Villa. Villa boss Steven Gerrard is keen to make Coutinho&#8217;s stay a permanent one, but Villa are unwilling to meet the asking price and instead want to negotiate a lower fee. However, Barca may decide to instruct the 29-year-old&#8217;s representatives to talk with other clubs. Ultimately, Barcelona are looking to strengthen their squad in the summer, but they need to move on players such as Coutinho before they can dip into the transfer market themselves.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Alexandre Lacazette is looking increasingly likely to leave Arsenal this summer, and L&#8217;Equipe reports the 30-year-old could be on his way back to former club Lyon. The French international joined the Gunners in 2017 from Lyon and is wanted by the Ligue 1 side&#8217;s president Jean-Michel Aulas, with Lacazette&#8217;s contract set to expire in June. Lyon approached Lacazette earlier in the year in the hope of persuading him to sign a pre-contract agreement, but now they&#8217;re hoping to get the deal over the line at the second time of asking. Lyon are also targeting Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema, but Lacazette is seen as the easier signing.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Robert Lewandowski, 33, has reportedly attracted the interest of FC Barcelona, who are keen to give him the long-term deal he wants after his current deal with Bayern Munich ends.\u00a0Boris Streubel\/Getty ImagesThe summer transfer window is approaching, and there&#8217;s plenty of gossip swirling about who&#8217;s moving where.
