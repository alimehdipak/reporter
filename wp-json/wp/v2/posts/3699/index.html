(Robert Iler), eat the best onion rings in Jersey at Holsten\u2019s. The song cuts off at \u201cDon\u2019t stop\u201d and we see 10 seconds of black screen before the final, silent credits roll.<\/p>\n<p>Now, with years of hindsight and a prequel, \u201cThe Many Saints of Newark,\u201d the mystery behind Tony\u2019s fate has been chipped away at \u2014 and it\u2019s much more subtle than \u201cSaw\u201d meeting \u201cThe Godfather.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Falco revealed on Chuck D\u2019s New York Knicks podcast that an alternate ending to the show was filmed with her and Gandolfini in 2010 in an effort to attract LeBron James to play in Madison Square Garden \u2014 even though she didn\u2019t know who he was. <\/p>\n<p>Similar to the end of \u201cGoodfellas,\u201d it depicted Tony\u2019s life in witness protection, likely thanks to the symbiotic relationship he had established with federal agent Dwight Harris (Matt Servitto). Despite heightened fanfare and speculation, the scene was never included in the show\u2019s canon and simply remains an unused, alternate-ending take.<\/p>\n<p>So, what actually happened to Tony?<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2021\/06\/sopranos-1-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"One television's most iconic show's has an ending that' still debated to this day.\" \/>One television\u2019s most iconic show\u2019s has an ending that\u2019 still debated to this day.WILL HART \/ HBO    <\/p>\n<h2>Soprano\u2019s own foreshadowing<\/h2>\n<p>In the show, Tony previously acknowledged to Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco) that \u201cthere\u2019s two endings for a guy like me, a high-profile guy: dead or in the can.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to the anticipated testimony of Carlo Gervasi (Arthur J. Nascarella) after his troublemaking son Jason was arrested, Tony is left preparing for an indictment that would likely put him behind bars for the rest of his life \u2014 so even if Soprano lives past dinner, his old ways are essentially over, symbolizing a proverbial death.<\/p>\n<p>Although, it doesn\u2019t appear Tony lives to see a trial.<\/p>\n<h2>A blackout ending<\/h2>\n<p>As the \u201980s rock song rings throughout the diner, there is a recurring shot of a man seated at the eatery\u2019s counter constantly looking back at Tony. He\u2019s credited as Man in Members Only Jacket, a reference to the first episode of Season 6, \u201cMembers Only,\u201d which saw FBI informant Eugene Pontecorvo (Robert Funaro) of Soprano\u2019s crew commit a very graphic suicide after neither party allowed him to retire with family to Florida.<\/p>\n<p>The final moments of the show see that man walk into the Holsten\u2019s bathroom, about 30 seconds before the cut to black. The move mirrors Tony\u2019s favorite scene in \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d when Michael Corleone takes a planted gun behind a restaurant\u2019s toilet to avenge his father\u2019s attempted assassination. <\/p>\n<p>While Members Only is in the bathroom, Meadow (Jamie-Lynn Sigler) parallel parks successfully after many false starts. She runs toward the entrance of Holsten\u2019s as Tony looks up right before \u2026 the end.<\/p>\n<p>If Tony was clipped at that moment, it would align with the shot continuity that Chase, who directed only the first and final episodes of the series, had selected.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2021\/06\/sopranos-2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=682\" \/>The theme of family appears throughout \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d with many meanings.Alamy Stock Photo    <\/p>\n<h2>The theories<\/h2>\n<p>Tony is the first of his family to arrive at Holsten\u2019s, and several people enter afterward, including Members Only. Each time someone comes in that front door, a bell rings and a close-up of Tony\u2019s face is shown to visualize his point of view to the audience.<\/p>\n<p>In the episode\u2019s closing seconds, that bell is heard, as Meadow is implied to be entering the restaurant. The camera cuts to Tony, presumably as Members Only emerges from the background, gun in hand, before the blackout. That silent darkness becomes Tony\u2019s point of view, something the show\u2019s final season symbolized on multiple occasions.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou probably don\u2019t even hear it when it happens,\u201d Bobby Baccalieri (Steven Schirripa) tells Tony a few episodes before, in \u201cSoprano Home Movies,\u201d as the duo share a morbid conversation about how they could perish. In \u201cThe Blue Comet,\u201d the penultimate episode of the series, Bobby is gunned down on the orders of an opposing mob boss. Later, Tony holds the gun that now deceased Bobby gave him for his birthday and flashes back to the \u201cDon\u2019t even hear it\u201d line.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2021\/06\/sopranos-4-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=682\" alt=\"Both Silvio and Bobby were on-screen examples of silence during a mob hit. \" \/>Both Silvio (left) and Bobby (right) serve as examples of an on-screen mob hit done in silence.Courtesy Everett Collection    <\/p>\n<p>Another instance of silence surrounding a mob hit is in \u201cStage Five,\u201d when consigliere Silvio Dante (Steven Van Zandt) has dinner with Gerry Torciano (John Bianco) and a shellshocked hush emerges while a gunman opens fire on Torciano. <\/p>\n<h2>The director\u2019s take<\/h2>\n<p>In 2020, Chase may have slipped up in interviews. After a decade-plus of refusing to explain the final scene, he referred to it as Tony\u2019s death. <\/p>\n<p>During a leaked interview for his book \u201cThe Sopranos Sessions,\u201d Chase inadvertently revealed the outcome when co-author Alan Sepinwall asked: \u201cWhen you said there was an endpoint, you don\u2019t mean Tony at Holsten\u2019s, you just meant, \u2018I think I have two more years\u2019 worth of stories left in me.\u2019 \u201d<\/p>\n<p>Chase responded \u201cYes, I think I had that death scene around two years before the end \u2026 But we didn\u2019t do that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou realize, of course, that you just referred to that as a death scene,\u201d co-author Matt Zoller Seitz then said.<\/p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t take the accidental admission to put the pieces together, though.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2021\/06\/sopranos-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"At times, Tony's decisions and oversights led his crew astray.\" \/>At times, Tony\u2019s decisions and oversights lead his crew astray.Alamy Stock Photo    <\/p>\n<h2>Tony\u2019s failures come to fruition <\/h2>\n<p>The entire sixth season revolves around Tony\u2019s failures, even leading into the last scene.<\/p>\n<p>Tony sees he could not put an end to Christopher\u2019s (Michael Imperioli) rampant drug use in \u201cKennedy and Heidi,\u201d just before killing his cousin, whose former fiancee became an FBI informant.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s followed up by A.J.\u2019s attempted suicide in Tony\u2019s pool in \u201cThe Second Coming.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Tony then drains the pool water, which at the show\u2019s beginning he waded in to feed ducks that symbolized his family. The Sopranos are now left with an empty, covered pool during colder weather.<\/p>\n<p>In the last episode, Tony has a quiet visit to Silvio in the hospital, who is not expected to regain consciousness.<\/p>\n<p>Again in silence, the boss likely reflects on the situation, which he could have done more to prevent.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2021\/06\/sopranos-3-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"One of TV's finest shows ended with one of the most controversial conclusions of all time. \" \/>One of TV\u2019s finest shows ended with one of the most controversial conclusions of all time. Alamy Stock Photo    <\/p>\n<p>He later sees a demented Junior (Dominic Chianese), who throughout the show teased Tony for never having \u201cthe makings of a varsity athlete.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sure enough, a mural of a local high school football standout is painted on the wall in Holsten\u2019s in the next scene.<\/p>\n<h2>Who capped the boss?<\/h2>\n<p>A question remains even if he is dead: Who killed Tony Soprano?<\/p>\n<p>Was it a relative of Eugene\u2019s? Did the New York crew not honor the ceasefire? Or did an interior decorator who killed 16 Czechoslovakians get his revenge? Where has Furio (Federico Castelluccio) been all this time?<\/p>\n<p>Not knowing for sure is a symbol in itself. Just as the family and loved ones of other killed-off characters never got their closure throughout the series, neither does Chase\u2019s audience, with the future of both the nuclear and criminal Sopranos family up in the air and no closure for one of television\u2019s most cryptic puzzles. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Exactly 15 years ago, millions frantically yelled, thinking they lost their cable connection as HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d ended its final season \u2014 thanks to creator David Chase inventing one of the most&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":3700,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[5],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3699"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/6"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3699"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3699\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3699"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3699"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3699"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
