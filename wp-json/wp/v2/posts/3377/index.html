Ra-fa!&#8221; filled the evening air, the man known as the King of Clay showed precisely what this meant to him.<\/p>\n<p>With every sprint-slide-and-stretch to reach a seemingly unreachable shot off the yellow racket of his opponent, Felix Auger-Aliassime; with every right-to-a-corner winner; with every well-struck volley, Nadal would hop or throw an uppercut or scream &#8220;Vamos!&#8221; &#8212; and, often, all of the above.<\/p>\n<p>Nadal got through his first serious test of this French Open by edging No. 9 seed Auger-Aliassime 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 across nearly 4\u00bd hours of even, entertaining tennis in the fourth round Sunday at Court Philippe Chatrier.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Being honest, every match that I play here, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s going to be my last match here in Roland Garros. &#8230; That&#8217;s my situation now,&#8221; said Nadal, who turns 36 on Friday. &#8220;That&#8217;s why I am just trying to enjoy as much as possible.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And the reward for coming through this one? A tantalizing matchup against rival Novak Djokovic in Tuesday&#8217;s quarterfinals.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/tennis\/story\/_\/id\/34004233\/\" \/>Rafael Nadal needed five sets to reach the French Open quarterfinals and set up a Tuesday date with familiar foe Novak Djokovic.\u00a0TPN\/Getty Images<\/p>\n<p>Nadal improved to 3-0 in five-set matches at the clay-court tournament he has dominated the way no one ever has dominated any Grand Slam event. Overall he is 109-3 here, and two of those defeats came against Djokovic, including in last year&#8217;s semifinals in their most recent showdown.<\/p>\n<p>The significance of the rivalry: Tuesday&#8217;s meeting between Djokovic and Nadal will be their 59th, more than any other two men have played each other in the sport&#8217;s professional era. Djokovic leads 30-28, although Nadal has a 7-2 advantage at the French Open.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We have a lot of history together,&#8221; said Nadal, who attended the Champions League final Saturday night won by his favorite club, Real Madrid, and didn&#8217;t get back to his room until after midnight.<\/p>\n<p>Looking at the larger picture, the formerly No. 1-ranked Nadal&#8217;s record 13 championships at Roland Garros are part of his haul of 21 Grand Slam trophies, a record for men. The currently No. 1-ranked Djokovic, twice the title winner at the French Open, is just one behind Nadal in the total Slam count, tied with Roger Federer at 20.<\/p>\n<p>Djokovic beat 15th-seeded Diego Schwartzman 6-1, 6-3, 6-3 earlier Sunday and has won all 12 sets he has played in the tournament.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a huge challenge,&#8221; Djokovic said about playing Nadal, &#8220;and probably the biggest one that you can have here in Roland Garros. I&#8217;m ready for it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p>The other quarterfinal in their half of the men&#8217;s bracket is between No. 3 seed Alexander Zverev and No. 6 Carlos Alcaraz, a 6-1, 6-4, 6-4 winner over No. 21 Karen Khachanov.<\/p>\n<p>Alcaraz produced one remarkable back-to-the-net, between-the-legs lob to a corner to earn the last service break he would need in the win that put the Spanish teenager in the French Open quarterfinals for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>Alcaraz accrued a 37-19 edge in winners against Khachanov and broke the big server five times.<\/p>\n<p>Last month, shortly before he turned 19, Alcaraz became the youngest man to break into the ATP&#8217;s top 10 since Nadal in 2005.<\/p>\n<p>Nadal and Auger-Aliassime produced high intensity tennis as the temperature dipped below 60 degrees Fahrenheit and a 10 mph wind made it feel even chillier as 9 p.m. approached during the denouement.<\/p>\n<p>Wrapped in souvenir orange French Open towels and blankets of various hues, spectators appreciated every last drop of drama, singing both players&#8217; first names and rising to their feet to applaud the many spectacular exchanges. One member of the audience, however, did not stick around for the fifth set: Toni Nadal, who is Rafael&#8217;s uncle and coached him to 16 of his Grand Slam titles, but now is helping coach Auger-Aliassime. Uncle Toni, as he&#8217;s known to many, stayed away from both players&#8217; guest boxes &#8212; how could he choose a side? &#8212; and instead sat in the front row right behind one of the baselines, applauding both men&#8217;s winners and avoiding showing any delight derived from anyone&#8217;s miscues before departing at the outset of the deciding set.<\/p>\n<p>He missed quite a finish.<\/p>\n<p>Nadal used increasingly aggressive tactics, moving forward when possible and pouncing on any short ball from his foe. Returning while up 4-3, Nadal snapped his left wrist for a forehand passing winner that left him yelling and punching the air &#8212; and left Auger-Aliassime, a semifinalist at the 2021 US Open but 0-2 for his career at the French Open until this year, hanging his head.<\/p>\n<p>That gave Nadal two break points, and he converted the second with a backhand winner. Soon enough, it all was over.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;He raised his level when he needed to,&#8221; Auger-Aliassime said.<\/p>\n<p>Nadal hadn&#8217;t dropped a set in the tournament until facing Auger-Aliassime, a 21-year-old from Canada equipped with a big serve and forehand.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I suffered,&#8221; Nadal said.<\/p>\n<p>Since starting the season with a 20-0 record, &#8212; including an Australian Open title in January, when Djokovic was not allowed to participate because he is not vaccinated against COVID-19 &#8212; Nadal has dealt with a rib injury and a recurrence of the chronic pain in his left foot that has troubled him for years. He has said repeatedly in Paris that he had no idea how well he&#8217;d be able to play.<\/p>\n<p>If he was hurting Sunday, it was impossible to know &#8212; and more to the point, impossible to tell. His movement was unhindered, his relentlessness intact.<\/p>\n<p>He will have time to recover and get ready himself to take on Djokovic, who spent roughly half as much time on court Sunday.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;These are special matches,&#8221; Nadal said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll have what it takes to beat someone like Novak, but I&#8217;m going to try.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><em>Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>PARIS &#8212; By the end of only the third five-setter Rafael Nadal has played in 112 career matches at Roland Garros, as the sun and temperature descended and the chants of &#8220;Ra-fa!
