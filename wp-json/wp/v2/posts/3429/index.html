FilmMagic    <\/p>\n<p>He first performed in Canada in the late \u201950s and realized he would stand out far more in a country where homegrown rock still barely existed. Canadian musicians had often moved to the U.S. to advance their careers, but Hawkins was the rare American to try the reverse.<\/p>\n<p>With drummer and fellow Arkansan Levon Helm, Hawkins put together a Canadian backing group that included guitarist-songwriter Robbie Robertson, keyboardists Garth Hudson and Richard Manuel and bassist Rick Danko. They became the Hawks, educated in the Hawkins school of rock.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen the music got a little too far out for Ronnie\u2019s ear,\u201d Robertson told Rolling Stone in 1978, \u201cor he couldn\u2019t tell when to come in singing, he would tell us that nobody but Thelonious Monk could understand what we were playing. But the big thing with him was that he made us rehearse and practice a lot. Often we would go and play until 1 a.m. and then rehearse until 4.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Robertson and friends backed Hawkins from 1961-63, putting on raucous shows around Canada and recording a howling cover of Bo Diddley\u2019s \u201cWho Do You Love\u201d that became one of Hawkins\u2019 signature songs.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"767\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/Canada-Music-Industry-Awards.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Ronnie and Wanda Hawkins\" \/>Ronnie and Wanda Hawkins arrive at the Canadian Music Industry Awards in Toronto on March 8, 2007.AP\/ Frank Gunn    <\/p>\n<p>But Hawkins wasn\u2019t selling many records and the Hawks outgrew their leader. They hooked up with Bob Dylan in the mid-\u201960s and by the end of the decade were superstars on their own who had renamed themselves the Band.<\/p>\n<p>Hawkins, meanwhile, settled in Peterborough, Ontario, and had a handful of top 40 singles there, including \u201cBluebirds in the Mountain\u201d and \u201cDown in the Alley.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He admittedly didn\u2019t keep up with the latest sounds \u2014 he was horrified the first time he heard Canadian Neil Young \u2014 but in the late 1960s he befriended John Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono. They stayed with Hawkins and his wife, Wanda, and three children while they were visiting Canada.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt that particular time, I thought I was doin\u2019 them a favor,\u201d he later told the National Post. \u201cI thought the Beatles were an English group that got lucky. I didn\u2019t know a lot about their music. I thought Yoko\u2019s was (silly). To this day, I have never heard a Beatle album. For 10 billion dollars, I couldn\u2019t name one song on \u2018Abbey Road.\u2019 I have never in my life picked up a Beatle album, and listened to it. Never. But John was so powerful. I liked him.
