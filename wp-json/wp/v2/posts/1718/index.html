And getting to work alongside great people like Courtney B.

Franklin Roberts (Vance), a veteran public defender with a complicated personal life, takes on Moses\u2019 case.

He makes everyone feel comfortable, and he sets the tone for a good environment to work in.

But for the most part, I\u2019ve never been in this situation,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing through these raw emotions, having your world crumble, and being in this world that you never wanted to be in was vulnerable. That was difficult to tap into that every day.
