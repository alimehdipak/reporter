The hashtags \u201c#RIPTwitter\u201d and \u201cDeleteTwitter\u201d were trending Monday \u2014 but so far there\u2019s no proof self-proclaimed progressives are following through. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cSince Elon Musk is buying Twitter, we need a new social media site to go to that won\u2019t sell out to right-wing nut jobs. Any suggestions?\u201d proclaimed one alleged Twitter quitter \u2014 who was still actively posting for their 41,000 followers Monday morning.<\/p>\n<p>The online backlash comes after Twitter\u2019s board of directors announced that it\u00a0accepted Musk\u2019s massive offer\u00a0to buy and privatize the company. <\/p>\n<p>Musk, who will pay $54.20 per share for the firm, has long stated that he wanted to acquire Twitter in order to restore the platform\u2019s status as a haven for free speech. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cFree speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,\u201d Musk said in a statement. \u201cI also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans. Twitter has tremendous potential \u2014 I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>However, many social media watchdogs barked at the seemingly benign acquisition as a hostile takeover that would drag online discourse back to the dark ages.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI still think Elon Musk owning Twitter is a bad idea. He will amplify racists, bigots, and misinformation,\u201d wrote former Trump supporter and Occupy Democrats opinion columnist David Weissman. \u201cHe is a bad-faith actor with his distorted views of free speech and censorship.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cElon Musk buying Twitter for 44 billion dollars as simply as me buying my weekly food shop at Aldi is actually terrifying,\u201d said another dissenter. <\/p>\n<p>WWE legend Mick Foley also pledged to jump ship, writing: \u201cI\u2019ll be giving some serious thought to leaving @Twitter for good in the near future. I do not have a good feeling about where this platform is heading.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Former Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean also chimed in. \u201cHi Twitterverse. Many thanks for the knowledge and sharing over the past ten years or so,\u201d Dean said on the platform. \u201cIf Musk takes over Twitter I will be off within a few hours. Might be just as well for my well being but I\u2019ve learned a lot of valuable stuff from many of you. Thank you all. Howard.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Note: Dean is still on the platform, tweeting frequently, nearly 24 hours later.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>Hi Twitterverse.

Best of luck.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>However, as of Tuesday morning, the former \u201cThe Good Place\u201d actress\u2019 account was still up and running. <\/p>\n<p>As some conservative pundits pointed out, the account of Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King was rumored to be deleted following Musk\u2019s takeover. However, it was still live as of Monday morning \u2014 along with a foulmouthed missive for Musk.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 25, 2022<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The hesitant Twitter quitters were ripped mercilessly online, with one Musk supporter writing, \u201cI can see you are leaving Twitter hasta la vista baby.

I\u2019m out. Deactivating my account today. I can\u2019t in good conscience use a platform that\u2019s run by an evil billionaire,\u201d mocked Daily Wire contributor Matt Walsh. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m sticking with Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. Standing on my principles.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He continued his jibes in a follow-up Tweet, writing: \u201cMy 4-year-old pangender child, Stardust, just asked, \u2018Matt, if Elon Musk takes control of Twitter, will hate speech be normalized? Is Democracy over? Will life even be worth living?\u2019 I looked at them and replied, \u2018Yes, yes, and no.\u2019 And we simply held each other and sobbed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Others compared the alleged Twitter exodus with liberals threatening to move to Canada \u2014 but not following through \u2014 after Donald Trump became president in 2016. Trump, meanwhile, said that he won\u2019t return to Twitter even if the ban on him is lifted, pledging instead to stick to his own \u201cmuch better\u201d Truth Social app, which launched in February.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"680\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/elon-musk-twitter-takeover-spawns-backlash-04.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"SpaceX founder and Tesla CEO Elon Musk visits the construction site of Tesla's gigafactory in Gruenheide, near Berlin, Germany, May 17, 2021. \" \/>SpaceX founder and Tesla CEO Musk visits the construction site of Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory in Gruenheide, Germany, in May 2021.

Ted Cruz tweeted Monday morning.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf Elon Musk can turn that around to actually protect free speech and encourage open discourse, Twitter\u2019s full potential will be unlocked.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>New Twitter boss Musk himself since weighed in on the subject, writing, \u201cI hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, on Monday night, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey called Musk\u2019s acquisition the \u201cright path\u201d for the company.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cElon\u2019s goal of creating a platform that is \u2018maximally trusted and broadly inclusive\u2019 is the right one,\u201d Dorsey\u00a0tweeted.<\/p>\n<p>Dorsey also thanked Musk and Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal \u201cfor getting the company out of an impossible situation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is the right path\u2026I believe it with all my heart,\u201d wrote Dorsey, who stepped down as CEO of Twitter in November.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/elon-musk-twitter-takeover-spawns-backlash-03.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Elon Musk, co-founder and chief executive officer of Tesla Inc., reacts while speaking during an unveiling event for the Tesla Model Y crossover electric vehicle in Hawthorne, California, U.S., on Friday, March 15, 2019. \" \/>Musk during an unveiling event for the Tesla Model Y crossover electric vehicle in Hawthorne, California, in March 2019.
