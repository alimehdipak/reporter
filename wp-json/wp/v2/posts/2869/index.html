Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>The blonde-haired, blue-eyed beauty was recently announced as the newest face of KVD Beauty and has walked on runways and red carpets for years, but she wants to help redefine the \u201cstandard template\u201d of beauty using guidance from her dad. <\/p>\n<p>The Jackson children rarely speak about their father but have shared sparse tidbits into life with the music legend in recent years. Paris previously spoke about how her father inspired a strong work ethic and eclectic music taste in his kids. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy dad was really good about making sure we were cultured, making sure we were educated, and not just showing us like the glitz and glam, like hotel hopping, five-star places,\u201d she told Naomi Campbell on her YouTube series\u00a0\u201cNo Filter.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGrowing up, it was about earning stuff. If we wanted five toys from\u00a0FAO Schwarz\u00a0or\u00a0Toys R Us, we had to read five books,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s earning it, not just being entitled to certain things or thinking, \u2018Oh, I got this.\u2019 It\u2019s like working for it, working hard for it \u2014 it\u2019s, it\u2019s something else entirely. It\u2019s an accomplishment.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When Campbell suggested that Paris was too famous to show up for model castings, she insisted that she is \u201ca full believer that I should earn everything.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI need to \u2026 I go to auditions, I work hard, I study scripts, I do my thing,\u201d she added. <\/p>\n<p>Paris\u2019 work ethic has proved to be fruitful as her career has taken off in recent years. Beyond runways, the young star has worked on high fashion campaigns, released an album and gone on tour. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Paris Jackson, 24, is opening up more about her late father, Michael Jackson, sharing new, rare insights about the King of Pop.
