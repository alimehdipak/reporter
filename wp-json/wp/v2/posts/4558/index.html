A meaningful introduction to the industry came through her now-ex-boyfriend, who was signed with Wilhelmina, and the agency had in turn asked him about Ashton. <\/p>\n<p>But as a Division I NCAA athlete, she wasn\u2019t able to work with brands at the time.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe basically told them, \u2018If NIL [Name, Image and Likeness] ever passes, she would be interested,&#8217;\u201d Ashton, 22, told The Post, referring to a newly implemented regulation that permits college athletes to profit off their personal brand. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/olivia-dunn-athlete-to-model.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"LSU gymnast Olivia Dunn has been the biggest earnest earners in the NIL era.\" \/>LSU gymnast Olivia Dunn has been the biggest earnest earners in the NIL era.Courtesy of American Eagle    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen the rules changed, it was obviously\u00a0at the front of my mind,\u201d she continued.<\/p>\n<p>And so at the end of Ashton\u2019s season \u2014 during which her team won the Ivy League title and finished in the nation\u2019s top 10 \u2014 she officially signed with the modeling agency\u2019s sports and fitness division.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think companies now want to see authentic body types,\u201d said Ashton, who hopes to land gigs with active brands such as Nike or Lululemon as well as break into the high-fashion space. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/chloe-ashton-harvard-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Chloe Ashton, a forward with the Women's Harvard hockey team recently signed with Wilhelmina Models.\" \/>Chloe Ashton, a forward with the Women\u2019s Harvard hockey team, recently signed with Wilhelmina Models.Stephen Yang    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/chloe-ashton-harvard-3.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Chloe Ashton in a game against Brown. \" \/>Chloe Ashton in a game against Brown. Gil Talbot\/Harvard Athletic Comm    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI am working out six days a week, anyway. It\u2019s the nature of being a college athlete on any leveI. I am not changing my body to have a certain aesthetic,\u201d she added.<\/p>\n<p>After the Name, Image and Likeness rule changed last July, the floodgates opened for both brands and talent, making a handful of athletes such as University of Miami women\u2019s basketball players the Cavinder twins millionaires within months. <\/p>\n<p>There have been noteworthy deals with nutritional supplements, protein bars, financial companies, apps and gyms \u2014 not to mention the many collaborations with local restaurants, dentists and car dealerships. So far, the fashion world hasn\u2019t fully embraced the newly available collegiate talent pool for endorsements or ads \u2014 though that is beginning to change.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt the outset, fashion brands weren\u2019t familiar with NIL but they are starting to come around and see the power and influence of these athletes,\u201d Keith Estabrook of Estabrook\u00a0Group told The Post. He\u2019s worked with athletes including LeBron James and Andre Iguodala and was an early force in fusing the worlds of sports and high fashion. The New York-based branding expert is working with a few college clients, many of whom are clamoring to broker deals within the style world.<\/p>\n<p>One of them is Khristian Lander, a point guard who transferred from Indiana to Western Kentucky \u2014 though it was his dyed blonde hair that caught Estabrook\u2019s eye.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was really excited when the rule changed and, personally, I wanted to do something with fashion,\u201d Lander, 19, told The Post. \u201cI take a lot of pride in my personal image.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>From a style standpoint, he looks up to Odell Beckham Jr. and follows the now-infamous NBA and NFL tunnel walks, which have become de facto catwalks that see pro-ballers transform into fashion billboards. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/khristian-lander.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Western Kentucky point guard Khristian Lander is hoping to work with fashion brands in the NIL era.\" \/>Western Kentucky point guard Khristian Lander is hoping to work with fashion brands in the NIL era.WKU Photography    <\/p>\n<p>Last season, Lander started to emulate the tunnel walk. His signature look is wearing his sneakers slung around his shoulder like the main characters in his favorite movie, \u201cWhite Men Can\u2019t Jump.\u201d He connected with a photographer who would snap him strutting to home games \u2014 something he plans to continue at Western Kentucky.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA couple of [my teammates] have talked about how we are going to put our best outfits together for the tunnel walks. Everyone is excited about it,\u201d said Lander, who has done smaller partnerships with a jewelry company, food brands and the homeless advocacy organization Help USA. He said he is close to finishing a few deals in the lifestyle and clothing world.<\/p>\n<p>One of the earliest fashion brands to jump on the NIL train was American Eagle, whose biggest audience is Gen Z. Last July, the company launched #AEAthletic Dept, courting social collaborations with the likes of Pittsburgh quarterback Kedon Slovis, Ohio State cornerback Sevyn Banks and Auburn running back Tank Bigsby.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve kind of been two or three steps ahead of the competition to go after this,\u201d Craig Brommers, the CMO of American Eagle, told The Post.<\/p>\n<p>While they snapped up football players, they found roaring success with an athlete in a niche sport: LSU gymnast Olivia Dunne. The slim blonde, boasting 1.9 million followers on Instagram and 5.6 million on TikTok, has become one of the top earners in the NIL era, surpassing the million-dollar mark last year.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re still learning as we go, but a few of these kids have really cut through in a big way and it moves the needle on social engagements,\u201d said Brommers, who declined to elaborate on the financial details of their partnerships.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"950\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/olivia-dunne-gymnast-1-2.jpg?w=950\" alt=\"LSU gymnast Olivia Dunne for American Eagle.\" \/>LSU gymnast Olivia Dunne for American Eagle.Courtesy of American Eagle    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/olivia-dunne-gymnast-2-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Olivia Dunne performing a floor routine during the a meet against Alabama.\" \/>Olivia Dunne performing a floor routine during a meet against Alabama.Jonathan Mailhes\/CSM\/Shutterstoc    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s Olivia Dunne and she was the number-one post of the first quarter, period. She is an outstanding gymnast from an SEC school, but she has an authentic, optimistic persona on social media. And she looks great in a pair of American Eagle jeans. That to me is the magic we\u2019ve been looking for as we explore this brave new world of NIL,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>Last month, Dunne posted an Instagram ad for Forever21 and, in September, she signed a deal with activewear company Vuori, which Forbes reported was worth \u201cmid-six figures.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFashion has always been a huge passion of mine,\u201d Dunne told the publication. \u201cBefore college, my coach and I would design my own custom leotards for all my major competitions. I love expressing myself through my style.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Ashton hopes her foray into modeling brings more prominence to the world of women\u2019s hockey, which isn\u2019t heavily represented in the lifestyle space.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of this NIL deal coming through. That this is really a showcase, showing many different\u00a0versions of strong, athletic, confident women and men.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/chloe-ashton-harvard-2.jpeg?w=1024\" alt=\"Harvard Hockey player Chloe Ashton is building her modeling portfolio. \" \/>Harvard Hockey player Chloe Ashton is building her modeling portfolio. Stephen Yang    <\/p>\n<p>As American Eagle can attest, their athletes have been good ambassadors where the Gen Z consumer is concerned, but Estabrook said NIL deals pay dividends beyond the brand\u2019s targeted audience.  <\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou have the\u00a0post-college demographic that will always be loyal and pay attention to their school\u2019s athletes. That\u2019s the sweet spot for brands,\u201d said Estabrook. \u201c[Using athletes] is cost-efficient, builds loyalty and it\u2019s authentic,\u201d he said, adding that higher-end brands\u00a0such as Tory Sport, Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren,\u00a0Kate\u00a0Spade and Coach\u00a0would be smart to do deals with athletes.<\/p>\n<p>Such partnerships can also create massive amounts of buzz, according to Brendan Kaminsky, founder of Bknown, a branding and social media company that has worked on NIL deals with Giants first-round draft pick Kayvon Thibodeaux.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt gets them all this earned media,\u201d said Kaminsky, referring to headlines that tout \u201cthe first fashion brand to do this or that.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>And the upside for the brand could be huge as time goes on.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere is always\u00a0going to be one Steph Curry from Davidson [College],\u201d said Estabrook. \u201cWhen he was there, he wasn\u2019t on a lot of people\u2019s radar. Look where he is now.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Given her athletic 5-foot-7-inch frame, Harvard hockey player Chloe Ashton has always held a casual interest in the modeling world.
