That&#8217;s a trend. Instead, look to the tough start of the season. The first seven games feature five playoff teams from last year and the Ravens and Dolphins on the road.

This has happened in 17 of the past 19 seasons, and the Ravens are in a great position to continue this trend. Baltimore gets back six starters who suffered season-ending injuries last year, along with a healthy and motivated Lamar Jackson, who is playing on the fifth-year option of his rookie deal. That&#8217;s a major boost to a Ravens team that lost five games by three points or fewer last season, including a one-point defeat to the eventual Super Bowl champion Rams.Read more from Jamison Hensley<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/nfl\/500\/cin.png&amp;h=110&amp;w=110\" width=\"31\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The Bengals repeat as AFC North champions.
