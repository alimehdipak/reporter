That\u2019s mainly because Musk \u2014 despite the fact he\u2019s the richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of $270 billion, according to Forbes \u2014 doesn\u2019t want to foot the entire bill for the acquisition, the sources added.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat it would take Musk to raise the equity \u2014 like selling his Tesla shares \u2014 is something he probably doesn\u2019t want to do,\u201d one source briefed on the situation told The Post.<\/p>\n<p>For similar reasons, Thoma Bravo \u2014 a major name in private equity whose past investments have include software security giant McAfee \u2014 would likely move forward on a Twitter buyout with Musk or not at all, the sources said. <\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Thoma Bravo executives are mixed on the idea \u2014 mainly because of Musk\u2019s erratic behavior and taste for controversial politics, according to the sources.<\/p>\n<p>The Post broke the news last week that Thoma Bravo, like Musk, was interested in buying Twitter. Now, Thoma Bravo would likely only move forward with Musk, or not at all, sources said. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/elon-74.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Elon Musk\" \/>As reported exclusively by The Post, Musk wants to spend $10 billion to $15 billion on buying Twitter, and needs partners to make up the rest of the $21 billion.AFP via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>Musk announced Thursday morning he has lined up $21 billion in cash equity from himself and other co-investors to make a $46.5 billion bid for Twitter. Musk said he also has arranged $25.5 billion of committed debt financing through Morgan Stanley in the form of loans against Twitter itself and his personal stock.<\/p>\n<p>With his Thursday filing, Musk could be signaling to Thoma Bravo it has committed financing in order to convince it to join forces and make what would be a binding proposal, insiders speculated on Thursday.<\/p>\n<p>A source close to the situation said Musk has had little difficulty getting interest from co-investors that have participated in funding rounds for his other ventures including Space X. Nevertheless, Musk didn\u2019t name any of his co-investors in the Thursday filing, and that has trained insiders\u2019 focus on Thoma Bravo.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThoma is important to Musk,\u201d a source said.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/twitter_19-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Twitter logo\" \/>So far, Twitter has neither accepted nor rejected Musk\u2019s offer.SOPA Images\/LightRocket via Gett   \t \t   <\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, executives at Thoma Bravo \u201csee an opportunity to take out a ton of costs,\u201d a source said, explaining why the firm remains interested in Twitter. <\/p>\n<p>Still, Thoma Bravo would likely only buy Twitter on a friendly basis and is not comfortable with the hostile tender offer Musk threatened again in the Thursday SEC filing, the source said. Meanwhile, Musk in a tweet last week quoted the 1956 Elvis Presley hit \u201cLove Me Tender,\u201d and another this week that referenced F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s novel \u201cTender Is the Night.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While Musk has signaled the possibility of a hostile tender offer, sources note that such a move would still require a negotiation with the board, which has enacted a so-called \u201cpoison pill\u201d that prevents him from acquiring more than 15% of its stock. <\/p>\n<p>Still, absent talks with the board, Musk could still launch a tender offer conditioned on Twitter removing the poison pill \u2014 a move that could enable him to gather shareholder support and pressure Twitter without triggering the pill.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/twitter-04-2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Twitter headquarters\" \/>Executives at Thoma Bravo \u201csee an opportunity to take out a ton of costs,\u201d a source said, explaining why the firm remains interested in Twitter.Anadolu Agency via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>As reported exclusively by The Post this week, Musk wants to spend $10 billion to $15 billion on buying Twitter, and needs partners to make up the rest of the $21 billion he said in the Thursday filing would be used in equity financing to buy Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>So far, Twitter has neither accepted nor rejected Musk\u2019s offer.<\/p>\n<p>A Twitter spokesman on Thursday said, \u201cWe are in receipt of the updated, non-binding proposal from Elon Musk, which provides additional information regarding the original proposal and new information on potential financing.
