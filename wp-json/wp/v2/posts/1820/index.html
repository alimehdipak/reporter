In addition to doubts about whether Twitter is worth the $54.20 a share that Musk offered on Thursday, sources said some investors appear skittish over his pattern of unpredictable behavior and taste for controversy.<\/p>\n<p>Musk himself is willing to invest between $10 billion and $15 billion of his own cash to take Twitter private, two sources close to the situation said. That\u2019s up from the current 9.1% stake in the company he revealed on April 4, which is worth about $3.4 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Musk may also be willing to borrow against his current stake if necessary, a move that could possibly raise several billion additional dollars, sources said. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/elon-musk-tesla-twitter-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Insiders say Elon Musk appears to be facing more trouble than expected in raising the money.\" \/>Insiders say Elon Musk appears to be facing more trouble than expected in raising the money.

Musk hinted at the hostile approach in a cryptic tweet over the weekend that quoted Elvis Presley\u2019s 1956 hit \u201cLove Me Tender.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Musk is planning to launch the tender offer for Twitter in 10 days or so, sources said.

On the other hand, sources note that most private equity firms prefer to stay away from political controversies and worry that they will not be able to control Musk, according to a source briefed on the process. <\/p>\n<p>Before disclosing his Twitter stake, Musk immediately began floating unusual ideas for the company including converting Twitter\u2019s San Francisco headquarters into a homeless shelter. Musk also said Twitter might be \u201cdying,\u201d and even suggested scrapping its business model, which relies on selling ads. <\/p>\n<p>Musk told Twitter\u2019s board the social network \u201chas potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe\u201d \u2014 an approach that has unleashed speculation he would reinstate Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter account, which was shut down following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/twitter-musk.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Twitter logo\" \/>Twitter on Friday adopted a so-called \u201cpoison pill\u201d preventing Musk from acquiring more than 15 percent of the company, signaling that the price was too low.REUTERS    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cPrivate equity firms don\u2019t get paid for headline risk,\u201d one source told The Post, referring to Musk\u2019s taste for controversy.<\/p>\n<p>Controversies aside, few private equity firms are willing to participate in a hostile bid, and Morgan Stanley is struggling to lure other banks to participate in the cash raise, sources said. Likewise, many appear doubtful whether Twitter is worth $43 billion, according to sources. <\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s despite the fact that Twitter on Friday adopted a so-called \u201cpoison pill\u201d preventing Musk from acquiring more than 15 percent of the company, signaling that the price was too low.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA lot of private equity firms are doing the work and struggling on the valuation,\u201d a source said. \u201cThis is not growing like Instagram or TikTok.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/elon-musk-twitter-2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Musk's Twitter account\" \/>Musk himself is to invest between $10 billion and $15 billion of his own cash to take Twitter private, two sources close to the situation said.

For his bid to succeed, he would have to win support from holders of a majority of Twitter stock to support a fully financed tender offer made directly to them. Then he could start a proxy contest trying to change the makeup of the board and remove the poison pill.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter\u2019s annual meeting is scheduled for May 25.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, The Post reported last week that private equity firm Thoma Bravo is exploring its own bid for Twitter, and Thoma Bravo has since reportedly told Twitter about its plans.<\/p>\n<p>A Musk spokesman declined comment.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Elon Musk is the richest person in the world, but he\u2019s scrambling to assemble a buyout bid for Twitter using other people\u2019s cash.
