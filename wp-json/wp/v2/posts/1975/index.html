The workout included running, ballhandling and shooting.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Feeling great,&#8221; Doncic told ESPN as he was leaving the arena.<\/p>\n<p>The Western Conference first-round series is tied as it shifts to Salt Lake City.<\/p>\n<p>The average absence due to calf strains for NBA players this season has been 16 days, according to information compiled by InStreetClothes.com. Mavs reserve guard Frank Ntilikina returned from a calf strain in 12 days earlier this season. Game 3 will be 11 days after Doncic was injured.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;He is a player that has so much ahead of him in his future, so him being smart about it is key,&#8221; said Mavs guard Jalen Brunson, whose career-high 41 points keyed the Game 2 win. &#8220;I think it just shows the trust that he has in us as well. He trusts us. He&#8217;s just making the best decision for himself. As teammates, we respect that.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Doncic, who sustained the injury in the April 10 regular-season finale, has been gradually ramping up basketball activities and made explosive moves off of his left leg for the first time during the recovery process in an individual workout Tuesday. He was a full participant in Wednesday&#8217;s practice, fueling cautious optimism that his return was on the horizon.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s going to be risk, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to play,&#8221; Doncic said Wednesday. &#8220;But like I say, yesterday and today we did some good things. If it&#8217;s not risk, I don&#8217;t want to play limited minutes because I&#8217;ll be nervous. I want to be out there the most time as possible, but like I say, I&#8217;m going to see how I feel and we&#8217;re going to talk to the medical staff.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m going to be 100%. I think that&#8217;s tough right now. But if I&#8217;m ready and there&#8217;s no risk of [aggravating the] injury, I&#8217;ll be out there.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Apr 21, 2022Adrian WojnarowskiCloseSenior NBA InsiderHost of The Woj Pod Joined ESPN in 2017Tim MacMahonCloseESPN Staff WriterJoined ESPNDallas.com in September 2009Covers the Dallas Cowboys and Dallas MavericksAppears regularly on ESPN Dallas 103.3 FMSALT LAKE CITY &#8212; Dallas Mavericks star Luka Doncic has been ruled out for Game 3 against the Utah Jazz on Thursday night.&#8221;He&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":1976,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[13],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1975"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1975"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1975\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1975"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1975"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1975"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
