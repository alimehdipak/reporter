I didn&#8217;t disrespect him. &#8230; I talked about what happened in 2018. That was in the past.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Acuna added later: &#8220;He never controlled me. He has a life and I have a life.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>According to the interview on Wednesday night, the crux of Acuna&#8217;s issues with Freeman, a five-time All-Star and the 2020 National League MVP, stemmed from disagreements with clubhouse rules during the 2018 season, when Acuna was a rookie.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When you come up as a rookie, there&#8217;s always someone who [wants to tell you how to do things],&#8221; Acuna said. &#8220;You come up from the minor leagues with the big eye black, the sunglasses, the hat low, and a lot of people see that as wrong. And the other person doesn&#8217;t see it as wrong because it&#8217;s part of the game.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;A lot of veterans [picked on me] when I was a rookie, and they called me into the office themselves and told me: &#8216;No, you can&#8217;t use that.&#8217; And they took [the eye black] off me with a towel like that. And I said, &#8216;OK, that&#8217;s fine.'&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Pujols then asked Acuna if he stayed quiet.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Yeah, of course. I can&#8217;t say anything, you know?&#8221; Acuna said. &#8220;I just said, &#8216;One day I&#8217;ll be a veteran.&#8217; I&#8217;m not saying I&#8217;m a veteran right now, but nobody&#8217;s going to take the eye black off my face now, you know?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Freeman on Thursday told MLB Network that as a veteran, he was just trying to enforce the same &#8220;organizational rules&#8221; that he had to comply with as a younger player and that he never viewed any &#8220;friction or clashes&#8221; with Acuna during their time together as teammates.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I saw the eye black situation,&#8221; Freeman told MLB Network about Acuna&#8217;s comments from Wednesday night. &#8220;When you put on a Braves uniform &#8230; In that organization, there&#8217;s organizational rules: You don&#8217;t cover the &#8216;A&#8217; [on your hat] with your sunglasses, you don&#8217;t wear earrings, you have your hair a certain length, you wear a uniform during BP, you don&#8217;t have eye black coming down across your whole face.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Those are just organizational things. So I guess I was one of the older guys that did have to enforce those things in the clubhouse. But when you put on a Braves uniform, those are kind of what happens there.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Braves manager Brian Snitker said he wasn&#8217;t aware of any conflict between Acuna and Freeman, &#8220;and if there was, it was between those two.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>When asked Thursday if he regretted saying that he wouldn&#8217;t miss Freeman, Acuna said he didn&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t regret it,&#8221; Acuna said Thursday. &#8220;He signed with another team. He asked me what I would miss about him. What should I miss about someone who&#8217;s on another team?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Freeman, meanwhile, said otherwise.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I loved Ronald. I still love Ronald. I&#8217;m going to miss Ronald. My family is going to miss Ronald,&#8221; Freeman told MLB Network. &#8220;And I can&#8217;t wait for him to get on the field again because the game of baseball needs him.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230; It&#8217;s unfortunate that he viewed it like that, but we were always told, you put on a Braves uniform, you&#8217;re supposed to act a little differently, hold yourself a little differently. And I just tried to uphold those rules as good as I could.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Freeman and the Dodgers open the season at the Colorado Rockies on Friday.<\/p>\n<p><em>ESPN&#8217;s Alden Gonzalez contributed to this report.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>ATLANTA &#8212; Braves outfielder Ronald Acuna Jr. acknowledged an internal rift with former teammate Freddie Freeman during an interview late Wednesday, saying there&#8217;s &#8220;nothing&#8221; that he&#8217;d miss about the first baseman.On Thursday, however, Acuna said those comments were &#8220;made a spectacle of,&#8221; while Freeman said the entire situation was &#8220;unfortunate.&#8221;Acuna, speaking in Spanish to Dominican&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":1278,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[13],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1277"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1277"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1277\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1277"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1277"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1277"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
