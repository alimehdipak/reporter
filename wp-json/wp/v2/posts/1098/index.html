methane could be a promising sign of life when found in a rocky exoplanet\u2019s atmosphere \u2014 even more so than oxygen.<\/p>\n<p>Such conditions include that along with methane, atmospheric carbon dioxide must also be present on the exoplanet.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, the exoplanet can not be water-rich, and its planetary atmosphere needs to have more methane than carbon monoxide.<\/p>\n<p>A team of researchers from the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) with support from NASA presented the findings in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.<\/p>\n<p>Methane is one of few biosignatures that could be detected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which was deployed this past Christmas Day.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOxygen is often talked about as one of the best biosignatures, but it\u2019s probably going to be hard to detect with JWST,\u201d said Maggie Thompson, a graduate student in astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC and lead author of the new study.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>JWST can identify chemicals like water and methane because of the infrared wavelengths they emit.<\/p>\n<p>Methane releases near-infrared red wavelengths (1-3 um), which is the level that the space telescope can best pick up.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\"

Lamarque\/File    <\/p>\n<p>Still, finding methane on an exoplanet does not necessarily mean that life is there.<\/p>\n<p>This is because many non-biological sources can release the chemical, such as volcanos, hydrothermal vents, and comet or asteroid impacts.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne molecule is not going to give you the answer \u2014 you have to take into account the planet\u2019s full context,\u201d Thompson said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMethane is one piece of the puzzle, but to determine if there is life on a planet you have to consider its geochemistry, how it\u2019s interacting with its star, and the many processes that can affect a planet\u2019s atmosphere on geologic timescales,\u201d she continued.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\"

  <\/p>\n<p>Thankfully, NASA\u2019s $10 billion space instrument may also be able to reveal whether a methane source on an exoplanet is biological or non-biological.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis study is focused on the most obvious false positives for methane as a biosignature,\u201d co-author Joshua Krissansen-Totton, an astrobiologist at UCSC said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe atmospheres of rocky exoplanets are probably going to surprise us, and we will need to be cautious in our interpretations,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\"

<\/p>\n<p>JWST reached its cosmic parking spot at Earth-sun Lagrange Point 2 (L2) nearly two months ago and is expected to begin operating this summer.<\/p>\n<p>Once live, the telescope will scour the night sky for faint infrared light, some of which might be emitted from the first generation of stars and galaxies.<\/p>\n<p>The data is expected to help researchers get a better understanding of the early days of our universe for many years to come.<\/p>\n<p><em>This story originally appeared\u00a0on The Sun\u00a0and was reproduced here with
