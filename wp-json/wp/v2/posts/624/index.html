We\u2019d go to lunch \u2014 those stupid Polish jokes were coming out at the time \u2026 and then two hours later, in the middle of a scene, I\u2019d look at him and say something and all the sudden [imitates Brando laughing] I\u2019d say, \u2018What the f\u2013k\u2019s the matter with you?\u2019 and he said [referring to the joke] \u2018That\u2019s funny.\u2019 Two hours later it was playing in his f\u2014ing head. He was like a child like that. I loved him.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Caan recalled how Coppola asked him to loosen up Lenny Montana, a hulking former pro wrestler and bodyguard for the Colombo crime family making his screen debut as gruff, feared Corleone enforcer Luca Brasi \u2014 who first appears in the opening scene during the wedding of Don Vito\u2019s daughter, Connie.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe knocks on the door and he says, \u2018Don Corleone, I am honored to be here on the day of your daughter\u2019s wedding, may her first child \u2026\u2019 He did it a couple of times, the door opens, with camera on the other side of the door with Marlon. Francis comes running out and said to me, \u2018Jimmy, do something!\u2019 I said, \u2018What are you talking about Francis?\u2019 He said, \u2018Do something with him.

He was smiling. He was happy.

They said, \u2018It\u2019s not in the script\u2019 and I said, \u2018What the f\u2013k\u2019s the difference, just put it down there.\u2019 I swear to God I had no idea what I was going to do with it, but I knew that\u2019s what a lot of guys did in my neighborhood. We called them \u2018attitude adjusters.\u2019 I just grabbed it and fired [the stick] at him and Francis said, \u2018That\u2019s great, Jimmy, you looked like you were going to miss him.\u2019 So he\u2019s lying behind the cars on the other side and luckily, on the upswing, I caught him on the top of the coconut.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/Sonny-Corleone-22-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" \/>Sonny, bloody Sonny: gunned down in a hail of bullets at a tollbooth.Getty Images    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/James-Caan-40.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Recent photo of James Caan.
