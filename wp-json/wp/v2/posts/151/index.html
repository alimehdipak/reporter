The fashion blogger Marina Rough, aka @InChargeofOutfits, posted an unboxing video of the candy-pink number that netted 1.4 million views. She has subsequently posted four more, including one with 321,000 views that noted: \u201cDon\u2019t be upset if you did not get the Skims bubblegum dress. Get this dress from Zara instead.\u201d A litany of other influencers followed, and now the hashtag #ZaraPinkDress has 1.7 million views on the platform.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/zara-dress-6.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=682\" alt=\"A Tik Tok user shows off her figure in the pink Zara dress\" \/>TikTok user Jada Cheyenne shows off her figure in the pink Zara dressCredit:jada.blackwell\/TikTok    <\/p>\n<p>The craze is reminiscent of the modest black-and-white polka-dot Zara dress that was ubiquitous in 2019. But this one \u2014 which is still available online \u2014 is sexier and more in line with the Y2K throwback aesthetic that has boomeranged into the hearts and closets of Gen Zers.<\/p>\n<p>As the trend was catching fire online, Getreu, who does influencer marketing at p.r. shop Alison Brod, was getting praise in real life. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhile I was in Miami, I got tons of compliments on [the dress]. Someone even asked me if it was from Alice + Olivia,\u201d added the Gramercy resident, referring to the pricey fashion brand.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/zara-pink-dress-5.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=682\" alt=\"Another Tik Tok user shows of the fit of the popular pink Zara dress\" width=\"623\" height=\"934\" \/>Another TikToker, Jesenia Martinez, user shows off the fit of the popular pink Zara dress.Credit:amjesenia\/TikTok    <\/p>\n<p>Trend reporter Brittney Levine said the dress hits all the right notes, from the color to the fit to the style.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe bubblegum pink is that perfect shade that is not too bright or overpowering,\u201d Levine told The Post. \u201cFrom every angle, it has this gleaming, shiny effect. It cinches just below the breasts so it\u2019s figure-flattering to women off all sizes. Plus, cutouts are major right now, but we\u2019re seeing them all on the front or side. This is more of a \u2018party in the back.\u2019 It shows off all your assets but hits in the right places.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And then there\u2019s the price tag.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnything under $100 that looks this good is a win for me,\u201d added Levine.<\/p>\n<p>Kate Beeks, 23, saw the frock on TikTok and immediately bought it off the Zara app.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI would consider myself to sometimes be a victim of influencers,\u201d Beeks, a publicist, told The Post. \u201cI am susceptible\u00a0to targeted ads, and I saw it and immediately\u00a0thought, \u2018I love this dress.&#8217;\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But most of all, she was drawn in by the quality.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/zara-dress-2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=682\" alt=\"The pink Zara dress has a sexy cut out in the back\" \/>The pink Zara dress has a sexy cutout in the back, as Emmy Andrews shows off.Credit:emmyqandrews\/TikTok    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt looked like a beautiful piece of clothing, like a luxury item, and it was an affordable price point. And it looked good on so many different body types.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Beeks, who bought a size small, the fit wasn\u2019t perfect. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was tight across my chest.
