According to the number-crunching researchers at Statista, nearly 50% of their users in 2021 were Gen Z or young millennials. <\/p>\n<p>But the fun doesn\u2019t stop when users hit 40. Despite bashing Gen Z for their social media craze, Gen X and Baby Boomers are creeping into their territory \u2014 comprising approximately 30% of users on the app. <\/p>\n<p>Kardashian joined the ranks of other 40-something celebrities on TikTok \u2014 including Reese Witherspoon, 46, and Kate Hudson, 43 \u2014 and even debuted her first clip, featuring her glam team, of course. After younger generations bullied older celebrities, like 63-year-old Madonna, for baring it all online, Kardashian\u2019s arrival on TikTok may signal a new attitude toward people older than 25.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/kardashian-tiktok.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Kim Kardashian on TikTok\" \/>Kim Kardashian\u2019s arrival on TikTok signals a new wave of nearly middle-aged \u2014 and older \u2014 content creators flocking to the app.Getty Images        <\/p>\n<p>While the average, noncelebrity parent might only be using the platform to watch clips, it\u2019s not too late for them to start creating their own content on TikTok, which is the most downloaded app of 2022 so far.<\/p>\n<p>At 54, TikTok star Tricia Goldsmith has racked up a whopping 2.7 million followers in just two years as @YourFitGrandma, reaching Gen Z viewers everywhere.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cJust because I\u2019m over 50 and I\u2019m a grandma doesn\u2019t mean that I can\u2019t cross over and do that younger crowd of music and stuff,\u201d Goldsmith, who has always loved pop culture, told The Post.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, she\u2019s such a hit amongst younger generations, she said she\u2019s easily recognized every time she leaves her Nevada home.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI usually will look at the parent, and I\u2019ll say, \u2018I know you don\u2019t know who I am, but your kids do,\u2019 \u201d she said with a laugh.<\/p>\n<p>Since she has hit influencer status among her Gen Z audience, Goldsmith shared her tips and tricks for making it on TikTok \u2014 because you\u2019ve only made it if you\u2019ve gone viral.<\/p>\n<h2>Know the lay of the land<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with the basics. <\/p>\n<p>Like any social media app, there\u2019s a curated feed chock-full of recommended, trending videos. But just how do the invisible algorithm gods know what brings you \u201cjoy\u201d?<\/p>\n<p>What videos you like, share or comment on \u2014 as well as content you create and accounts you follow \u2014 all play into your unique \u201cFor You\u201d page. Information such as geography, language, hashtags, captions and sounds also contribute to what you see, according to TikTok.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to reaching a targeted audience, then, Goldsmith said she seeks out a musical \u201csound\u201d or audio clip that is getting the most engagement \u2014 also known as \u201ctrending\u201d \u2014 and uses that.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI go with what\u2019s trending,\u201d she said, adding that jumping on a trend early is best. \u201cOn my \u2018For You\u2019 page is more, like, younger genres of music, and I try to be the only older person that is in that trend.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Mastering the tools<\/h2>\n<p>Getting geared up to create content is necessary, but it doesn\u2019t have to be scary \u2014 or expensive.<\/p>\n<p>After watching other people\u2019s videos and seeing their lighting and equipment, Goldsmith wanted to copy their recipe for good-looking clips.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI would look at videos and I\u2019m, like, \u2018Oh, I need to get a ring light.\u2019 I\u2019d see people with the purple lights in the background and I was, like, \u2018OK, I just need to order some stuff off of Amazon,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cReally, my setup and things that I use are not expensive at all.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Enlist some help<\/h2>\n<p>But good lighting, hair and makeup don\u2019t ensure a viral video. For Goldsmith, she also had to learn to use video transitions and TikTok\u2019s in-app editing tools.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d see somebody do a transition, or they\u2019re using a certain feature \u2026 I would save the video and go through it frame by frame,\u201d she said of her learning technique. \u201cI would search tutorials for a certain trend.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And 92-year-old Lill Droniak \u2014 a k a @GrandmaDroniak, a sassy senior influencer with 4.2 million followers \u2014 also had the help of her grandson, Kevin, to show her the ropes.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI had fun, so we kept doing it,\u201d she told The Post. \u201cI think TikTok is for all ages, so you\u2019re never too old to start doing it. Just post anything, and see how people like it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Even celebrity parents \u2014 like Witherspoon \u2014 have relied on their Gen Z (or younger) kids on TikTok, whether they run an account themselves and focus on embarrassing their kids to generate millions of views, or they make guest appearances in their children\u2019s clips.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily for Kardashian, she had the help of her daughter, North West, on their joint account \u2014 @kimandnorth \u2014 before going solo on her own. <\/p>\n<p>North, clearly the creative director on the account, enlists the help of Kardashian. In one clip with more than 4 million likes, the pair rock out and lip-sync to Katy Perry\u2019s \u201cHot N Cold.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Know your audience<\/h2>\n<p>Describing her content as \u201cyouth-driven,\u201d Goldsmith said her page was \u201csaturated with Gen Z\u201d viewers after changing her content. While her account was once yoga-focused, jumping on trends made her viewership grow.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAfter a year, I finally hit my goal of the audience,\u201d she said. \u201cI was ready to quit a year ago.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Her younger audience tells her she makes them \u201cfeel like it\u2019s OK to be old\u201d or that they want to be like her when they\u2019re older, she said. <\/p>\n<p>But she warned against \u201ctrying too hard.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid \u2014 just be yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to be your authentic self because the camera sees everything.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As do the commenters, of course.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGen Z is harsh,\u201d she continued, referencing the critiques she receives. \u201cFor every 30 amazing comments and stuff, I have 10 that just go for the jugular.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So perhaps don\u2019t take after superstar quarterback Tom Brady, who may try a little too hard to be hip, despite getting millions of views.<\/p>\n<p>For those not so lucky to be Super Bowl champs or attain socialite status, Goldsmith said to seek out inspiration. \u201cFind somebody you really like \u2014 whether they be younger, older, a celebrity, whoever that may be \u2014 and you model your content after what they\u2019re doing,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Goldsmith also advised having \u201ca sense of humor\u201d and just keep trying to find one\u2019s sweet spot.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like anything you do in life: You have to practice at it,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Kim Kardashian is proof you\u2019re never too old for TikTok.
