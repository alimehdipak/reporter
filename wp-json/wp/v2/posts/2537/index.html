The decision to prolong was based on their potential to continue bringing new discoveries and addressing compelling further science questions.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cExtended missions provide us with the opportunity to leverage NASA\u2019s large investments in exploration, allowing continued science operations at a cost far lower than developing a new mission,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Lori Glaze, director of the Planetary Science Division at NASA\u2019s Headquarters in Washington. \u201cMaximizing taxpayer dollars in this way allows missions to obtain valuable new science data, and in some cases, allows NASA to explore new targets with totally new science goals.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As long as spacecraft remain healthy, the missions could be extended for three years.<\/p>\n<p>OSIRIS-APEX:\u00a0OSIRIS-REx (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer) is on its way back to Earth to deliver samples of asteroid Bennu. This mission will be continued for nine years due to its next venture.<\/p>\n<p>Next up, the spacecraft plans to encounter the 1200-foot asteroid Apophis which will come within 20,000 miles of Earth in 2029. NASA says that OSIRIS-APEX will enter orbit around Apophis soon after the asteroid\u2019s Earth flyby, providing an unprecedented close-up look and study changes in the asteroid caused by its close flyby of Earth. It will then use the spacecraft\u2019s gas thrusters to attempt to dislodge and study the dust and small rocks on and below Apophis\u2019 surface.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>MAVEN:\u00a0The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) will study the interaction between Mars\u2019 atmosphere and magnetic field during the upcoming solar maximum. NASA says this will deepen their understanding of how Mars\u2019 upper atmosphere and magnetic field interact with the Sun.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"577\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/e1-pia25175.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"NASA\u2019s Curiosity Mars rover used its Mast Camera, or Mastcam, to survey these wind-sharpened rocks, called ventifacts, on March 15, 2022.\" \/>NASA\u2019s Curiosity Mars rover used its Mast Camera, or Mastcam, to survey these wind-sharpened rocks, called ventifacts, on March 15, 2022.NASA\/JPL-Caltech\/MSSS    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/306_mastcam-top.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"The Curiosity rover have driven more than 16 miles on Mars and explored the history of habitability in Gale Crater.\" \/>The Curiosity rover have driven more than 16 miles on Mars and explored the history of habitability in Gale Crater.Matrs Nasa    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/osiris-rex.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"OSIRIS-REx will be the first U.S. mission to carry samples from an asteroid back to Earth.\" \/>OSIRIS-REx will be the first U.S. mission to carry samples from an asteroid back to Earth.NASA&#8217;s Goddard Space Flight Cent    <\/p>\n<p>InSight:\u00a0The Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport mission\u2019s seismic monitoring of \u201cmarsquakes\u201d has provided constraints on Mars\u2019 interior, formation, and current activity. It has operated the only active seismic station beyond Earth, and with the extension, it will continue its seismic and weather monitoring. NASA says that the mission is unlikely to continue operations for the duration of its current extended mission unless its solar panels are cleared by a passing \u2018dust devil\u2019 in Mars\u2019 atmosphere.<\/p>\n<p>Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter:\u00a0LRO will continue to study the surface and geology of the Moon. The evolution of LRO\u2019s orbit will allow it to explore new regions in detail, including the Permanently Shadowed Regions where water ice may be found. NASA says that it will also provide crucial programmatic support for NASA\u2019s efforts to return to the Moon.<\/p>\n<p>Mars Science Laboratory:\u00a0This will be the fourth extended mission for MSL. MSL and its Curiosity rover have driven more than 16 miles on Mars and explored the history of habitability in Gale Crater. NASA says that it now plans to explore the critical sulfate-bearing layers, which give unique insights into the history of water on Mars.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"577\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/pia04816-16.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"The Mars Odyssey mission provides a communication relay for robots on the Martian surface.\" \/>The Mars Odyssey mission provides a communication relay for robots on the Martian surface.Mars Nasa    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"617\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/hubble-saturn-2021.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter slewed to allow LRO Camera (LROC) to acquire this magnificent view revealing Saturn and its rings.\" \/>NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter slewed to allow LRO Camera (LROC) to acquire this magnificent view revealing Saturn and its rings.NASA\/GSFC\/Arizona State Universi    <\/p>\n<p>New Horizons:\u00a0In its second extended mission, New Horizons will continue to explore the distant solar system. Previously, New Horizons flew past Pluto in 2015 and the Kuiper belt object Arrokoth in 2019. NASA says that the spacecraft can potentially conduct multi-disciplinary observations of relevance to the solar system and NASA\u2019s Heliophysics and Astrophysics Divisions.<\/p>\n<p>Mars Odyssey:\u00a0This mission will perform new thermal studies of rocks and ice below Mars\u2019 surface, monitor the radiation environment, and continue its long-running climate monitoring campaign, NASA says. It also provides unique support for real-time data relays from other Mars spacecraft.<\/p>\n<p>Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter:\u00a0MRO will study the evolution of Mars\u2019 surface, active geology, ices and atmosphere and climate. This is the sixth extended mission for MRO. It also will provide essential data relay service to other Mars missions.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>NASA has extended the planetary science missions of eight of its spacecraft, which will help deepen the understanding of the solar system.
