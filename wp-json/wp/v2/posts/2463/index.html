The late attorney, who had a well-publicized jet-set lifestyle, had turned the castle\u2019s interior into an elaborate showplace.<\/p>\n<p>Mitchelson, who also represented Tony Curtis and Sonny Bono,\u00a0lost the seven-bedroom, nine-bathroom estate, situated on four acres, in bankruptcy after a tax fraud conviction that led to him serving two years in federal prison.

When Johnny Depp bought it he spent quite a time renovating it, trucking in huge trees to completely hide it.

At that time he was throwing money away like crazy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/john-ryan-johnny-depp-neighbor-02.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Neighbor John Ryan is tired of the traffic and constant gawking by tourists.\" width=\"618\" height=\"411\" \/>Neighbor John Ryan is tired of the traffic and constant gawking by tourists.John Chapple\/www.JohnChapple.com    <\/p>\n<p>The castle was designed in 1931 and built over six years by Hersee Moody Carson, an eccentric former school teacher from Louisiana who became wealthy thanks to her third and fourth husbands.<\/p>\n<p>Number three, Beverly Hills businessman Peter Gross, committed suicide after being blackmailed by his housekeeper over an affair they were having.<\/p>\n<p>Carson then wed George Campbell Carson, a coal\u00a0miner with a second-grade education, who earned his millionaire status after spending almost two decades in court\u00a0battling mining companies over a patent infringement.\u00a0He won $20 million from them in 1925.<\/p>\n<p>Hersee went on a spending spree, buying art and antiques \u2014\u00a0including Louis XVI furniture and Hepplewhite cabinetry \u2014 for the castle she dubbed \u201cMount Kalmia\u201d in\u00a0honor of a mountain laurel flower.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/johnny-depp-amber-heard-home-06.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Over the years, the home has been occupied by the likes of lawyer Marvin Mitchelson, Motown founder Berry Gordy and Orlando Bloom.\" \/>Over the years, the home has been occupied by the likes of lawyer Marvin Mitchelson, Motown founder Berry Gordy and Orlando Bloom.Corbis via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>According to Los Angeles realtor and researcher James Colin Campbell, who has investigated the\u00a0castle\u2019s history, Hersee\u00a0\u201chired 100 workers to build the three-story, 7,500-square-foot castle which she designed\u00a0herself as she went along. No expense was spared.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The amenities included 125 stained glass windows, hand-painted wallpaper and an underground conveyor belt running from the street to the kitchen for deliveries. Once the castle was completed in 1933, Hersee divorced Carson\u00a0who died the\u00a0following year after cutting her out of his will. She sued his Carson family heirs and won a settlement. <\/p>\n<p>But it was too late: During the early years of World War II, the city of Los Angeles bought the place for $9,000 after Hersee fell delinquent on her taxes. (She died in 1972 at 93.) It was then leased to a burlesque dancer who turned it into a boarding house with 38 renters, among them a comedy writer for Bob Hope.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/johnny-depp-01-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Depp purchased the castle in 1995 for $2.3 million.\" \/>Depp purchased the castle in 1995 for $2.3 million.POOL\/AFP via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>For years, the castle has long been rumored to have been the eerie domicile of Hollywood legend Bela Lugosi, famous for his portrayal of Count Dracula, but that was a fiction made up by tour guide operators to generate business and interest.<\/p>\n<p>In the 1950s, the place was occupied by the right-hand man of billionaire Howard Hughes, Noah Dietrich, who oversaw the germaphobe\u2019s movie-making empire.
