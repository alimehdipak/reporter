Aryna Sabalenka and Victoria Azarenka of Belarus, which has aided Russian forces, would also be unable to play.<\/p>\n<p>Djokovic compared the situation of the excluded players to what he went through in January, when he was unable to play the Australian Open. He was deported from Australia for not being vaccinated against COVID-19.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not the same thing, but going through something similar earlier this year for myself, it&#8217;s frustrating knowing that you&#8217;re not able to play,&#8221; Djokovic said. &#8220;I still stand by my position that I don&#8217;t support the [Wimbledon] decision. I think it&#8217;s just not fair, it&#8217;s not right, but it is what it is.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The All England Club had defended its action in a statement first posted on Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In the circumstances of such unjustified and unprecedented military aggression, it would be unacceptable for the Russian regime to derive any benefits from the involvement of Russian or Belarusian players with The Championships,&#8221; the statement said.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>MADRID &#8212; Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic criticized Wimbledon&#8217;s decision to exclude Russian and Belarusian players from this year&#8217;s tournament following Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine.The two tennis greats said Sunday that Wimbledon had acted unfairly, with Nadal saying that the decision was &#8220;very unfair&#8221; to his Russian colleagues.&#8221;It&#8217;s not their fault what&#8217;s happening in this&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":2330,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[13],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2329"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2329"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2329\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2329"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2329"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2329"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
