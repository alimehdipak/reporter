Irving and Durant had not had any contact with the Nets since Irving opted into his deal on Monday.<\/p>\n<p>The Phoenix Suns and Miami Heat are two of the teams Durant has at the top of his list, sources told ESPN. Nets general manager Sean Marks is working with Durant and his business manager Rich Kleiman to find a trade, Kleiman told ESPN.<\/p>\n<p>Durant averaged 29.9 points, 7.4 rebounds and 6.4 assists this season but played just 55 games during the regular season as he recovered from an MCL injury.
