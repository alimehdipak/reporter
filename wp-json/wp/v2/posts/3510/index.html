The field is at +270.<\/p>\n<p>The Sooners&#8217; repeat bid begins with a matchup against No. 9 seed Northwestern (2:30 p.m. ET, ESPN\/ESPN App). If they win, they would play the winner of Texas and No. 5 UCLA (noon ET, ESPN\/ESPN App).<\/p>\n<p>On the other side of the bracket, Oregon State faces No. 14 Florida (7 p.m. ET, ESPN\/ESPN App), while Arizona faces No. 7 Oklahoma State (9:30 p.m. ET, ESPN\/ESPN App).<\/p>\n<p>Can anyone prevent Oklahoma from winning it all again? Do any of the three unseeded teams &#8212; the most in a single WCWS &#8212; have a chance at shocking the world? Our analysts make their WCWS predictions.<\/p>\n<h2>Which team are you most surprised that made it to the WCWS?<\/h2>\n<p>Michele Smith: Oregon State and Arizona. Both teams have played their best ball of the year at the end of the season, and that&#8217;s always a huge component of making it to the WCWS. Oregon State beating Tennessee on the road shows just how good the Beavers are.<\/p>\n<p>Jenny Dalton-Hill: If you had asked me five weeks ago and told me Arizona would make the WCWS, I would never have believed you. After all, they were swept to begin Pac-12 play and were last in the standings. Caitlin Lowe is a wizard to not just figure out how to get the most of this team, but to do that in her first year at the helm after replacing Mike Candrea.<\/p>\n<p>Amanda Scarborough: I&#8217;m most surprised Oregon State made it to the WCWS. The Beavers were one of the last four teams into the tournament <em>and<\/em> they&#8217;ve had to play regionals and super regionals on the road. The biggest surprise to me came when they beat No. 11 Tennessee, and they haven&#8217;t looked back since.<\/p>\n<p>Jen Schroeder: I&#8217;m going to say Arizona. For me, it&#8217;s because they lost their first eight games in conference play. I really felt like on Selection Sunday, we were waiting to see if their name was going to be called, and now we&#8217;re going to be watching them in the WCWS.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/college-sports\/story\/_\/id\/34015244\/\" \/>While Jocelyn Alo leads Oklahoma with 29 home runs and a 1.797 OPS, teammate Grace Lyons has 21 homers and a 1.388 OPS\u00a0OU Athletics<\/p>\n<h2>What makes this year&#8217;s Oklahoma team different than last year&#8217;s team?<\/h2>\n<p>Smith: I believe their pitching is more consistent this year, however the injury to Jordy Bahl will make them have to rely even more on their offense. It&#8217;s incredible to say, but their offense is even better this year than last year&#8217;s amazing offensive team. It&#8217;s mind blowing.<\/p>\n<p>Dalton-Hill: This year&#8217;s team has fewer home runs but more maturity and experience. They have less experience in the circle but a more calm offense that doesn&#8217;t panic. Their two losses taught them the lessons needed to be a complete team, and it shows. If they get Jordy Bahl back, whew!<\/p>\n<p>Scarborough: Their pitching staff. Last year, their ERA was 2.49. This year, their ERA is a staggering 0.80. They&#8217;re not giving up as many runs, and interestingly enough, they&#8217;re run production is a *tick* down. Last year, they averaged 10.6 runs per game, and this year it&#8217;s a 9.19 runs per game clip. (Both are extremely good.)<\/p>\n<p>Schroeder: Oklahoma&#8217;s pitching depth this year makes them a tougher team to face in the postseason. Their top three arms each have an ERA under 1.00.<\/p>\n<h2>Who has the best chance at stopping the Sooners from repeating?<\/h2>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p>Smith: UCLA and\/or Oklahoma State. Oklahoma State has seen OU&#8217;s pitching in four games this year. And if Megan Faraimo is on fire, the Bruins could be a tough game for the Sooners.<\/p>\n<p>Dalton-Hill: It&#8217;s not who can keep up with them with pitching and defense. You have to be able to keep up with their offense. This group can score &#8212; and score a lot. Two teams have shown they can beat them once, but I don&#8217;t see anyone able to beat them twice.<\/p>\n<p>Scarborough: I think Oklahoma State has the best chance. Coming into the WCWS, Kelly Maxwell is pitching lights out and hasn&#8217;t allowed a run in the NCAA tournament. The Cowgirls also have the confidence knowing that they have beaten them before and know them well.<\/p>\n<p>Schroeder: I believe UCLA has the best chance at stopping the Sooners from repeating. Both Megan Faraimo and Holly Azevedo have 20 wins &#8212; only the ninth time they&#8217;ve had teammates with 20 wins in program history. And who wouldn&#8217;t want an epic rematch of the 2019 championship series?<\/p>\n<h2>Who will be the last two teams standing?<\/h2>\n<p>Dalton-Hill: I would love to see a UCLA-Arizona final &#8212; they met in the championship seven times before, with Arizona winning four of those &#8212; but in the end, one of the final teams will be Oklahoma.<\/p>\n<p>Scarborough: With the chaos that has already ensued this postseason, there is absolutely no way to tell! But an Oklahoma-Oklahoma State final would certainly be intriguing.<\/p>\n<p>Schroeder: If this were a postseason where chalk holds on both sides of the bracket, I would pick Oklahoma-Oklahoma State. However, this postseason has been <em>nothing<\/em> like that. I could see Oklahoma beating UCLA in the winners bracket, then UCLA advancing to the championship series once the bracket flips. It also wouldn&#8217;t be surprising to see an Oklahoma-Florida matchup. Either way, what I&#8217;ve learned this postseason is to expect the unexpected.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The 2022 Women&#8217;s College World Series begins Thursday, and seven teams will have the opportunity to stop No. 1 seed Oklahoma from repeating.To say the Sooners have dominated would be an understatement.
