Guardino, 22, was born with a rare condition that causes blindness, but he beat the odds and is now on the road making a name for himself on one of the industry\u2019s biggest stages \u2014 which he told The Post\u2019s Angela Barbuti is \u201cso exciting \u2014 but it\u2019s craziness.\u201d <\/em><\/p>\n<p>Can you explain the condition you had as a kid?\u00a0I was born with a rare disorder called Leber congenital amaurosis, but we call it LCA. It\u2019s a disorder that causes a gene that\u2019s missing in your eye, because if the gene isn\u2019t there, it\u2019s not producing proteins that your cells need to live, so they all start to die off and then it causes inevitable blindness. But when I was 13 years old, I received an experimental gene therapy and a few years ago, it got approved by the FDA. And when I got the treatment, it was experimental and it was in hopes just to stop that inevitable blindness, but for me, it\u2019s done so much more. I got to see the moon for the first time. I got to see stars for the first time, fireworks.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"231\" height=\"347\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/italian-idol-1029-1.jpg?w=231\" alt=\"Born with a rare condition that causes blindness, Guardino has beat the odds and is blowing audiences away.\" \/>Born with a rare condition that causes blindness, Guardino has beat the odds and is blowing audiences away.ABC via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>What was going through your head when Lionel Richie asked your mom to come on stage at the audition?\u00a0Honestly, it was crazy to be there in front of Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie. Just the fact that I was there in front of them and able to perform in front of them was insane. I\u2019ve been a huge fan of Lionel Richie pretty much my entire life. My mom grew up on Lionel. When he was like, \u2018Where\u2019s your mother? I want to meet your mom,\u2019 I was like, \u2018This is nuts. She\u2019s gonna flip out.\u2019 And I went to go grab her. Honestly, it was such a blur because I was losing it the entire time.<\/p>\n<p>Are your parents both Italian?\u00a0My mom\u2019s side is Irish and Italian. My dad\u2019s side is off the boat from Sciacca, Sicily. They met down there. My mom was on vacation in Italy.<\/p>\n<p>Does your family all watch \u2018Idol\u2019 together?\u00a0For the last few episodes that have been airing, we\u2019ve been doing viewing parties. My uncle runs a bar called PeraBell on Main Street in Patchogue and we\u2019ve been doing viewing parties down there. For Easter, they\u2019re gonna have one. I was at the few that we threw while I was there, like for the audition.<\/p>\n<p>So you won\u2019t be with your family for Easter this year?\u00a0Yeah, and that feels so weird. We throw a massive feast\u00a0\u2014\u00a0lamb, pasta. It\u2019s ridiculous the amount that we cook.<\/p>\n<p>Does your family make lamb or goat?\u00a0My father loves goat. We don\u2019t eat goat though. We eat lamb. I would try goat though.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"231\" height=\"347\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/italian-idol-1031.jpg?w=231\" alt=\"Guardino stays true to his New York roots.\" \/>Guardino stays true to his New York roots.ABC via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s your favorite place in New York to have pizza? I\u2019m gonna have to shout out my buddy Paul at Gino\u2019s Pizzeria in Ronkonkoma.<\/p>\n<p>Do you have a favorite place to get cannoli?\u00a0Yeah, Dolci Momenti Bakery [in Patchogue]. That\u2019s my buddy\u2019s bakery. My buddy Stefano runs it.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s your favorite sports team here?\u00a0Now you\u2019re making me really think. I gotta say the Yankees, man. I can\u2019t not say the Yankees, you know? But they still suck, you know what I\u2019m saying? They\u2019re not doing well.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s on your iPod right now?\u00a0Everything. The music I listen to is such a melting pot. I\u2019ll go from Jazmine Sullivan, some R&amp;B s\u2013t to heavy metal, like Slipknot, in the span of two songs.<\/p>\n<p>Can you give us a glimpse into Sunday\u2019s episode?\u00a0What was cool is we did this at Disney\u2019s Aulani resort. And it\u2019s in Hawaii, and I\u2019ve never been to Hawaii before \u2026 and the fact that I can go there for the first time and perform there and have that first time be with \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d that\u2019s insane.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/italian-idol-1030.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Guardino with Bebe Rexha.\" \/>Guardino with Bebe Rexha.ABC via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>What is something you hope viewers take away from your performances?\u00a0That\u2019s a good question because I\u2019ve been thinking about that a lot \u2026 I want to be able to bring people together. This world that we\u2019re living in, I think, has really f\u2014-d a lot of people up. And it\u2019s changed how people view society and how people do things. If there\u2019s anything that I feel like I want to do, in the show and in the future through music, I want to bring people together through the message of music and what everybody as a collective has been through in the last few years \u2026 and just forgot all the stupid b\u2014\u2014t that everybody has going around. I want to have everybody have fun. That\u2019s really what I look at going into every performance.\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Long Island-native Christian Guardino struck a major chord with the judges on ABC\u2019s \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d earning him a spot among the show\u2019s top 24 contestants \u2014 and a trip to Hawaii to&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":1532,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[5],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1531"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/6"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1531"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1531\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1531"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1531"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1531"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
