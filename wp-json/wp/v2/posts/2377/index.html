This makes sense given Libra\u2019s focus on relationships and its penchant for the finer things in life. Other potential rulers of Libra include Saturn, Mars, and Juno. Some astrologers even suggest that no planet rules Libra directly, but rather that it is ruled by both Venus and either Saturn or Jupiter.<\/p>\n<h3>what planet rules Virgo?<\/h3>\n<p>Astrology is a complex and nuanced field, and there are many different factors that can influence a person\u2019s astrological sign.

The planet Mars represents energy, action, and assertiveness. People who are born under the sign of Aries tend to be natural leaders and go-getters.
