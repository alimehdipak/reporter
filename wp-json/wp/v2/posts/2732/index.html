Every game that we play at this point in the year, it&#8217;s huge,&#8221; said Brown, who agreed Sunday to become the Sacramento Kings new coach after this postseason run. &#8220;So to have that kind of thrown at you, you&#8217;ve got to switch gears because I know what my responsibilities are going in as Mike Brown the assistant coach, and it changes.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But Brown has done this previously. He led the Warriors to an 11-0 record during the 2017 title run when Kerr was out dealing with debilitating symptoms from complications of back surgery two years earlier.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;His head coaching record for a Warrior playoff game I think is undefeated,&#8220; Klay Thompson said. &#8220;We did miss Steve a lot, just his voice, his presence, but we&#8217;ve been here before, 2017 when Mike took over and we rolled off a lot of wins, so I reflected on that a lot.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Kerr had been wearing a mask for the past several days before his positive test on Monday. It&#8217;s unclear if he will travel with the Warriors on Tuesday to Memphis for Wednesday&#8217;s Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals.<\/p>\n<p>The Warriors now lead the series 3-1.<\/p>\n<p><em>The Associated Press contributed to this story. <\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>8:28 PM ETKendra AndrewsESPN SAN FRANCISCO &#8212; Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr tested positive for COVID-19, the team announced Monday evening.He entered the league&#8217;s health and safety protocols and wasn&#8217;t on the bench for Monday&#8217;s 101-98 win in Game 4 over the Memphis Grizzlies.Associate head coach Mike Brown assumed coaching duties.&#8221;Obviously there&#8217;s butterflies,&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":2733,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[13],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2732"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2732"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2732\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2732"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2732"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2732"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
