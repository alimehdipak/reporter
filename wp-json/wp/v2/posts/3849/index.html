This is not surprising given how delicate the material is. There is puckering at the back by the hooks and eyes,\u201d among other instances of damage.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFrom the bottom of the Met steps, where Kim got into the dress, to the top where it was returned, the dress was in the same condition it started in,\u201d said Ripley\u2019s VP of Publishing and Licensing Amanda Joiner in a statement on Thursday.<\/p>\n<p>The reality-star-turned-businesswoman only wore Monroe\u2019s artifact for a matter of minutes. She slipped into the gown in a dressing room near the Met Gala carpet and\u00a0changed into a replica gown\u00a0as soon as she made it up the steps.<\/p>\n<p>Kardashian\u00a0reportedly went body-makeup-free\u00a0to the event. In addition, a representative for Ripley\u2019s told The Post that she showed \u201cthe utmost respect\u201d for the garment.<\/p>\n<p>Monroe originally wore the dress in 1962 to serenade then-President John F. Kennedy for his birthday. <\/p>\n<p>Ripley\u2019s received backlash for letting the Skims founder take the dress out on the town in the first place. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur mission is to both entertain and educate visitors and fans, and sparking conversations like the discourse around Marilyn Monroe\u2019s dress does just that,\u201d Ripley\u2019s rebutted. \u201cNo matter which side of the debate you are on, the historical importance of the dress has not been negated, but rather highlighted. An entirely new group of young people have now been introduced to the legacy of Marilyn Monroe.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>On Monday, the Marilyn Monroe Collection Instagram account\u00a0posted photos\u00a0showing alleged new damage to a few \u201cmissing\u201d crystals and others \u201changing on by a thread.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Kardashian, 41, vowed to not make any alterations to the dress \u2014\u00a0declared a \u201cnational treasure\u201d\u00a0to The Post by one noted Monroe expert \u2014 and altered\u00a0<em>herself<\/em>\u00a0instead. She infamously\u00a0admitted that she lost 16 pounds\u00a0in three weeks in order to squeeze into the dress.<\/p>\n<p>She was finally able to fit it over her famous derriere but was unable to zip it \u2014 hence why she draped herself with a white fur shawl while on the carpet.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI tried it on and it didn\u2019t fit me,\u201d Kardashian\u00a0recalled on the red carpet\u00a0as she retold the tale of her first fitting. \u201cIt was such a challenge. It was like a role, I was determined to fit in it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"743\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/kim-kardashian-monroe-dress-06.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Ripley\u2019s Believe It or Not! will continue to exhibit the dress \u2014 in as-is condition \u2014 at Ripley\u2019s Believe It or Not!
