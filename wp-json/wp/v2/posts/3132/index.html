Who could have predicted that Ellie Kemper would pee her pants, or that the entire cast would almost be killed \u2014 twice?\u201d she wrote.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a very hot day and whenever we started filming, the air conditioning on the bus had to be turned off because it was too noisy. We were basically in a moving hot tin can with no air. I thought Brian [Baumgartner] and Creed [Bratton] were going to melt. Oscar [Nunez] looked dead inside. Plus, it was a very curvy road. Jenna was getting a little carsick even though she had a forward-facing chair,\u201d Kinsey, 50, wrote. \u201cAt that point, the heat and the nausea seemed like our worst obstacles.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Once out on the open road, the script called for a scene of \u201cDwight driving like a maniac.\u201d The bus was hooked up to a rig when the crew recorded Rainn Wilson at the wheel. But the reactions didn\u2019t look real enough as the cast members pretended to be thrown around, so a stunt driver was called in. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere were no stunt actors, however. We stayed on and were told to keep doing what we\u2019d been doing. And off we went,\u201d Fischer mentioned in the book. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe were all bouncing down the road, blissfully unaware of what was about to happen. We were saying our lines and everything was going smoothly when all of a sudden, we heard the assistant director yell, \u2018Swerve!&#8217;\u201d Kinsey explained. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/office-dangerous-tv-03.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Angela Kinsey, Oscar Nunez, Jenna Fischer in an episode of The Office\" \/>Fischer, who starred as Pam on the hit show, and Kinsey, who played Angela, recounted the day that the cast and crew were crammed into an airport shuttle bus for a whole day of shooting. \u00a9NBC\/Courtesy Everett Collectio   \t \t   <\/p>\n<p>The stunt driver swerved \u201cHARD\u201d and the cast and all of their furniture, props, and set decorations went flying around the bus. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe were all smushed up against the side of the bus. Ellie\u2019s chair crashed into Jake [Lacy]\u2019s. Jake\u2019s crashed into mine, and I was shoved against the glass window. Papers were everywhere. I caught our desk lamp as it slid into my lap. A few people fell on the bus floor, and we could barely see them because so many things had fallen on top of them,\u201d Kinsey explained.<\/p>\n<p>The cast was let go for lunch after being boxed into the crammed sweltering set and were happy to learn that the crew had acquired a portable air-conditioning unit that would blow air in through the sunroof. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cOff we went. No more laughing fits. No more peeing. We were nailing our shots. That\u2019s when I noticed a funny smell,\u201d Fischer said. She continued to raise the concern but was ignored, until others began to agree. \u201cWe began debating whether the bus smelled funny. Then our camera operator spoke up. She didn\u2019t feel well. She stumbled and set down her camera.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGuess what?\u201d Fischer wrote. \u201cThe portable air-conditioning unit\u2019s INTAKE hose was right next to the EXHAUST pipe on the bus. So that hose was sucking in exhaust and blowing it straight into the sunroof of the bus. We were all being slowly poisoned. Or not so slowly, actually.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The cast and crew survived the harrowing day of shooting and continued on wrapping up the final season of the beloved sitcom. \u00a0The ninth and final season concluded on\u00a0May 16, 2013.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cThe Office\u201d almost put several members of the cast and crew permanently out of work.
