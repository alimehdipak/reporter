Mainly: What is a caprese salad without tomatoes? (The answer is cheese.)<\/p>\n<p>The strange lunch order is something that Wintour would reportedly order five to six years ago but is still available on the menu at the Palm in Tribeca. <\/p>\n<p>According to Grub Street, the meal plus tip goes for $77.33, which is a bit more than an average worker\u2019s lunch today; that could cost a still-hefty $15 or even hover near $20. <\/p>\n<p>The average cost of a salad did shoot up 11% since last year, but without the juicy red tomatoes, is a caprese salad still considered a salad? <\/p>\n<p>Miranda Brooks, Wintour\u2019s landscape designer for her house in Mastic, Long Island, shared some insight as to why the leading fashionista would forgo such a vital part of a classic dish. <\/p>\n<p>In the biography, Brooks claims that she tried to convince Wintour to plant a vegetable garden on her 42 acres of land but was shot down because Wintour \u201cdoesn\u2019t like vegetables.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Odell explained to New York magazine that she learned of the order from two different people. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"663\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/anna-wintour-lunch-03.jpg?w=663\" \/>Wintour, 72, has been the editor-in-chief of Vogue since 1988, during which she\u2019s cemented her front-row seat in the fashion world. Gilbert Carrasquillo    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe lunch would have been picked up typically by the second assistant,\u201d Odell explained, adding that the deluxe dish would arrive with a ceramic plate provided by the Palm and would then be re-plated by an assistant. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou know how in\u00a0\u2018The Devil Wears Prada,\u2019\u00a0we see the assistants throwing the plate in an office sink?\u201d Odell continued. \u201cIn more recent years, the plate was packed up and sent back to the Palm, which then cleaned it.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>The strange revelation of Wintour\u2019s lunch order is just one of many questions that \u201cAnna\u201d has answered, but the book has also brought forward new queries about the notoriously private figure. <\/p>\n<p>Is a caprese salad still a salad without tomatoes? How does a woman above 65 supposedly eat only red meat and cheese for lunch? How has Wintour reportedly not tasted a vegetable she likes in over 70 years while dining at some of the best restaurants in the world?  <\/p>\n<p>In the words of Miranda Priestly, \u201cPlease bore someone else with your questions.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Caprese \u2026 without tomatoes?
