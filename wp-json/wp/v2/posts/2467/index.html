The Microsoft co-founder said he participated in the meetings while attempting to raise money for the Gates Foundation \u2013 though Epstein already had a 2008 conviction on a charge of soliciting prostitution from minors when the dinners took place.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt the time, I didn\u2019t realize that by having those meetings it would be seen as giving him credibility. You\u2019re almost saying, \u2018I forgive that type of behavior,\u2019 or something,\u201d Gates said in a Sunday interview with The Times in the UK. \u201cSo clearly the way it\u2019s seen, I made a huge mistake not understanding that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Last fall, Gates said Epstein had purported to have ties with potential donors for the Gates Foundation\u2019s global health initiatives.

Reports that Gates engaged in inappropriate relationships with subordinates at Microsoft have sparked an ongoing investigation at the tech giant.<\/p>\n<p>Gates also said that he still considers his ex-wife to be a \u201cfriend\u201d \u2013 though she declined to use the same word to describe their current relationship during an interview earlier this year.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"769\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/Jeffrey-Epstein_08.jpg?w=769\" alt=\"Jeffrey Epstein\" \/>Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide while in federal prison in 2019.Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m also grieving the same way she is,\u201d Gates said. \u201cYes. You know, we grew up together. When I got married, yeah, Microsoft was a big deal.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBut I was a young 38-year-old and she was a mature 28-year old [when they married], and over those next few years, in terms of what we learnt together, what went well, what didn\u2019t go well\u2026 I mean, that\u2019s more than half my adult life.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnd so, yes, you\u2019re very used to going home and saying, \u2018Oh, I did this well,\u2019 or, \u2018Oh, I did this poorly,\u2019 or, \u2018Oh, I called this person the wrong name.\u2019 We did a lot together,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>French Gates revealed her views over her ex-husband\u2019s past decision to meet with Epstein during an interview with \u201cCBS Mornings\u201d in March.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/gates-84.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Bill Gates\" \/>Bill Gates addressed his dealings with Jeffrey Epstein in a lengthy interview with the Sunday Times.Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>French Gates said she met with Epstein just one time and \u201cregretted it from the second I stepped in the door.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe was abhorrent.
