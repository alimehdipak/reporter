This hot new release is part of most book lists \u2014 and not just for its riveting cover of the Italian riviera. <\/p>\n<p>When Katy\u2019s mother dies, she sets out on a solo trip to Positano, the southern landmark of lemons, luscious relaxation and lots of oceanic scenes. It\u2019s one of the most thought-provoking books I read this year, surrounding the theme of discovering your true identity, overcoming grief on your own terms and finding magic along the way. <\/p>\n<p>               <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2021\/12\/2-20.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Island Time by Georgia Clark\" \/>Amazon    <\/p>\n<p>Georgia Clark is one of the most inspiring authors I\u2019ve had the pleasure of crossing paths with through her writing. \u201cIsland Time\u201d is her upcoming release that centers on a family who becomes stranded on an Australian island after a volcano erupts. It\u2019s a wonderful, light read to take with you on vacation or to read when the sun\u2019s shining.<\/p>\n<p>What makes this work stand out from the rest is how beautifully Clark weaves her characters together; each one has a different personality and different subplots to follow. Plus, there are underlying themes of gender equality, authenticity and living life one day at a time.<\/p>\n<p>               <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/1-21.png?w=1024\" \/>Amazon    <\/p>\n<p>OK, real talk \u2014 even if you\u2019re not keen on thrillers, \u201cThe Golden Couple\u201d is a must-read. I was hooked from beginning to end (and, the ending isn\u2019t <em>so <\/em>predictable, which I appreciated).<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s an electrifying story of two wealthy Washington suburbanites, Marissa and Matthew, who are navigating their marriage through counseling after infidelity. Enter Avery, their therapist, who\u2019s investigating this \u201cgolden couple\u201d off the clock, too. It\u2019s spicy, seductive and just ideal to sift through.<\/p>\n<p>               <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/2-18.png?w=1024\" \/>Amazon    <\/p>\n<p>Instantly made a national favorite, \u201cThe School for Good Mothers\u201d deserves all the praise and acclaim for being one of the most unique novels I\u2019ve had the pleasure of reading. One author, Liz Moore, dubbed it \u201chaunting and unforgettable,\u201d saying she\u2019s \u201cin awe of Jessamine Chan\u2019s mind.\u201d I couldn\u2019t agree more. <\/p>\n<p>When Asian American protagonist Frida, the mother of Harriet, has a \u201chorrible day,\u201d she\u2019s led to a surveillance-housed campus where she\u2019ll learn how to be a good mother. It perfectly portrays the perils of culture differences, the struggles of motherhood and socioeconomic differences among caregivers. It\u2019s probably next on deck to turn into a movie, too.<\/p>\n<p>               <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/3-10.png?w=1024\" \/>Amazon    <\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been a fan of Orenstein\u2019s fiction work for a while, as she has a voice of her own for being a former matchmaker and journalist by trade. Her latest release, \u201cMeant to Be Mine\u201d is just as delightful as her other three novels, too.<\/p>\n<p>Here, we explore Edie, the protagonist who has been waiting for a specific date to meet the love of her life (after her grandmother Gloria predicted meet-cutes for decades). When she meets who she instantly aligns to be the love of her life, she\u2019s led to question if\u2019s perfect timing \u2014 or, if fate-led relationships are a hoax.<\/p>\n<p>If you love the traditional rom-com, you\u2019ll love this new spinoff. It\u2019s magical, wistful and leaves you in love with her words just as much as love for the characters (and hope for love in general, TBH).<\/p>\n<p>               <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/4-11.png?w=1024\" \/>Amazon    <\/p>\n<p><em>Wow<\/em>, if you\u2019re looking for a great book you\u2019ll be instantly obsessed with, \u201cA Novel Obsession\u201d hits the nail on the head \u2014 in both title and story.<\/p>\n<p>Naomi Ackerman, a NYC-based bookseller and aspiring novelist, grows an uncanny obsession with her boyfriend\u2019s ex-girlfriend. The \u201cresearch\u201d for her debut novel (of which she\u2019s been procrasting writing) turns into impromptu meet-ups, and you\u2019re just going to have to read for more.<\/p>\n<p>I couldn\u2019t put this book down. It became a page-turner on my commute to work (both ways) and there won\u2019t be another one like it. Ultimately, Naomi must decide what\u2019s worth the perfect ending. It\u2019s <em>so <\/em>spicy.<\/p>\n<p>               <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/7-6.png?w=1024\" \/>Amazon    <\/p>\n<p>All hail the Queen of Beach Reads, Jennifer Weiner. Her latest release, \u201cThe Summer Place,\u201d is one of the more relatable reads to enjoy by the beach or pool \u2014 and, intelligently, makes pandemic references and touches on modern-day life to put this season into a whole new perspective.<\/p>\n<p>The character-driven plot homes in on Sarah and her stepdaugher Ruby who\u2019s planning a wedding with Gabe, her pandemic boyfriend she quarantined with at NYU. Along the way, you\u2019ll meet Sarah\u2019s former best-selling novelist mother Veronica, along with her brother, Sam, who\u2019s on a self-discovery journey of his own.<\/p>\n<p>Perfectly packaged into the hottest summer read, it\u2019s one we recommend IRL, too. <\/p>\n<p>               <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/7-7.png?w=1024\" \/>Amazon    <\/p>\n<p>Speaking of Weiner, you have to read \u201cThat Summer\u201d (add both to your to-read list while you\u2019re at it). Infused with beautiful, summery scenery from Cape Cod, the luscious descriptions of buttered lobster rolls and dips at the ocean make it one of the most well-written fiction books I\u2019ve read.<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind that this book references sexual assault, so it may be a bit heavy for some. However, it\u2019s a thought-provoking book that balances deeper topics and easy-breezy days of summer to a T.<\/p>\n<p>               <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/ugj.png?w=1024\" alt=\"The Unsinkable Greta James by Jennifer E. Smith\" \/>Amazon    <\/p>\n<p>As a fan of cruise vacations, I knew I had to read \u201cThe Unsinkable Greta James.\u201d It\u2019s also unique in that it focuses on a father-daughter relationship \u2014 one that\u2019s somewhat of a rarity in modern-day fiction.<\/p>\n<p>On a cruise to Alaska, both characters are sharpening their relationship by vacationing in close quarters, maturing in how they view themselves and resisting the urge to change. It\u2019s an extremely light read \u2014 perfect for the warmer months, especially \u2014 and the characters are hard not to love.<\/p>\n<p>Integrating the struggles of womanhood throughout, it\u2019s the perfect coming-of-age story about growth, love and learning about what matters most.<\/p>\n<p>               <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2021\/12\/3-21.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" \/>Amazon    <\/p>\n<p>Oh, how sweet this debut novel is from Rebecca Hardiman. \u201cGood Eggs\u201d homes in on three generations of a whimsical Irish family whose tensions ignite once a home aide enters their lives. <\/p>\n<p>Filled with much wisdom (after all, an eighty-three-year-old), this casual read leaves you with the feeling that life is never too old to start living and that no single family is perfect \u2014 and that\u2019s just part of what fills up your cup.<\/p>\n<p>               <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2021\/12\/4-20.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" \/>Amazon    <\/p>\n<p>Truth be told, I\u2019ve read \u201cOne Day in December\u201d and \u201cThe Two Lives of Lydia Bird\u201d by Josie Silver and, while I\u2019d read them again, nothing compares to the author\u2019s new release, \u201cOne Night on the Island.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In this charming rom-com, Cleo scurries out of the country from her editorial job and into the throes of a remote Irish island to celebrate her thirtieth birthday. But, when she arrives, a handsome Boston native is already nice and cozy in what should have been Cleo\u2019s rental property.<\/p>\n<p>This easy-to-follow \u201copposites attract\u201d novel is heartfelt and gave me all the feels (seriously, I was on the brink of tears at times). It\u2019s phenomenal and worth the read.<\/p>\n<p>               <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2021\/12\/5-18.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" \/>Amazon    <\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve read a boatload of rom-com novels (as if you couldn\u2019t already tell), but when I say Kate Spencer\u2019s debut novel \u201cIn a New York Minute\u201d was one of the best ones I\u2019ve read in a while, I\u2019m not kidding.<\/p>\n<p>When Franny is laid off from her interior design job, her dress ends up ripping when caught in a NYC subway door \u2014 as if her day couldn\u2019t get any worse. But, when a well-suited man gives her his jacket, they end up going viral on social media.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll just have to read it to find out the rest, but I seriously couldn\u2019t put this one down. I loved all the modern-day language, too, and it is totally relatable if you\u2019re a Gen Z or millennial; this one is such a gem!<\/p>\n<p>               <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2021\/12\/6-19.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" \/>Amazon    <\/p>\n<p>Oh, Colleen Hoover. Like many avid readers, I\u2019ve read a good amount of her novels (like \u201cNovember 9\u201d and \u201cVerity\u201c), though \u201cReminders of Him\u201d was the most emotion-packed and beautifully woven together.<\/p>\n<p>After five years in prison due to a tragic mishap, Kenna has her eyes after two things: (1) reinventing herself and (2) reconnecting with her daughter. When she runs into a bartender who\u2019s the only connected trace of finding her, things become interesting.<\/p>\n<p>The ending is the most shocking and hand-to-heart moment I\u2019ve had in a while and, though a bit heavier than other books on the list, you won\u2019t regret reading this one.<\/p>\n<p>               <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2021\/12\/7-20.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" \/>Amazon    <\/p>\n<p>If you follow new releases, you likely know that \u201cThe Love Hypothesis\u201d has received all the acclaim. It\u2019s especially great for science lovers, college students and those who love all things academia. <\/p>\n<p>I especially loved this collegiate-grounded plot, circling a bright PhD student and a professor with a cold interior. It\u2019s another novel that\u2019s a must-read (and, it gets quite steamy), great for fans of traditional rom-coms.<\/p>\n<p>               <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2021\/12\/8-18.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" \/>Amazon    <\/p>\n<p>As a journalist, I, of course, had to read \u201cWeather Girl.\u201d Perfect for fans of \u201cThe Ex Talk\u201d (Rachel Lynn Solomon\u2019s other novel I enjoyed), the meteorologist and sports reporter relationship was unique to follow and a delight for the whimsically minded. <\/p>\n<p>Not to mention, it\u2019s relatable to the masses, with undercurrents of mental health advocacy and a whole bunch of weather-related puns, metaphors and proverbs.<\/p>\n<p>               <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2021\/12\/9-17.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" \/>Amazon    <\/p>\n<p>As a devout fan of Sara Desai\u2019s \u201cThe Marriage Game,\u201d her recent release is chock-full of Indian culture and romance. After a devasting breakup, Zara is accustomed to sitting at the singles table for her schedule of weddings and happens to cross paths with someone she doesn\u2019t particularly like: Jay.<\/p>\n<p>As a celebrity-obsessed lawyer, Zara strikes a deal with Jay to play matchmaker for him if he\u2019ll connect her to his roster of connections. It\u2019s unpredictable, well-written and a lovely warm-weather read.<\/p>\n<p>               <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2021\/12\/10-17.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" \/>Amazon    <\/p>\n<p>As a new author, \u201cWithout a Hitch\u201d is one of those wonderfully woven reads that continues to be a source of inspiration for me. Written by a duo with experience in the wedding planning business, \u201cWithout a Hitch\u201d centers on a twenty-something Lottie who lands a new career at an upscale wedding boutique firm where she\u2019s planning lavish, bouquet-filled ceremonies.<\/p>\n<p>But, the kicker: Lottie is faced with planning her ex-boyfriend\u2019s wedding. This novel has a refreshing angle on southern charm, facing your fears and perhaps falling in love along the way.<\/p>\n<p>               <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2021\/12\/11-11.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" \/>Amazon    <\/p>\n<p>As mentioned, Clark has my heart for her beautiful writing. \u201cIt Had to Be You\u201d is a modern take on \u201cLove Actually,\u201d centering on a handful of NYC natives who are all woven together in some capacity.<\/p>\n<p>This witty rom-com features Liv, who recently lost her husband, and eventually takes over their co-owned wedding business with his secret girlfriend, Savannah \u2014 a younger, southern blonde.

But, she soon realizes that this sparks-fly connection happens on his wedding day.<\/p>\n<p>After a future of reconnecting, they learn that perhaps these moments are real and meant-to-be.

Well, that\u2019s what happened to Willa in \u201cThe Wedding Ringer,\u201d and this book deserves way more praise than it currently has.<\/p>\n<p>Filled with strong themes of friendship, love and finding your own path, it\u2019s one of those rom-coms that\u2019s not cliche and will keep you on your toes.<\/p>\n<p>               <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2021\/12\/16-9.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" \/>Amazon    <\/p>\n<p>I absolutely love how brilliant \u201cCheat Day\u201d is, Liv Stratman\u2019s debut novel.

It\u2019s a cute, socialite-surrounding favorite of mine that I recommend tenfold.<\/p>\n<p>               <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2021\/12\/20-5.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" \/>Amazon    <\/p>\n<p>I absolutely adored Hannah Orenstein\u2019s rom-com, \u201cLove at First Like,\u201d focusing on Eliza, who accidentally posts a photo of her wearing an engagement ring from the jewelry boutique she co-owns with her sister. When sales skyrocket, she decides to fake a \u201csecret fiance.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>On a quest to find love, she ends up meeting someone special. It\u2019s a modern-day novel that\u2019s worth diving into this spring, along with her upcoming release, \u201cMeant to Be Mine\u201d (which is next on my list).<\/p>\n<p>               <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/book.png?w=1024\" \/>Amazon    <\/p>\n<p>If you love essays, you\u2019ll love this collection by Sophia Benoit. As a writer and comedian, it\u2019s exuberantly funny, touches on the struggles and raw emotions surrounding paternal divorce, body image and relationships, and explores growing up in today\u2019s society.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s great about this book is it\u2019s easy to read it in chunks (the beauty of essays!) and inevitably relatable to everyone. For a light read, it fits the bill.<\/p>\n<p>               <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/29-1.png?w=1024\" \/>Amazon    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cCover Story\u201d centers on aspiring writer, Lora, who lands a summer internship at ELLE magazine and meets seasoned editor Cat, who takes Lora under her wing. It\u2019s a great read about friendship, ambition and the journalism industry at-large.<\/p>\n<p>When a scandal emerges, there\u2019s a slew of emails and FBI correspondence to spice up the book as a whole, and it\u2019s an insightful and interesting tale that you should read ASAP.<\/p>\n<p>               <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/30-1.png?w=1024\" alt=\"Bless Your Heart, Rae Sutton\" \/>Amazon    <\/p>\n<p>Beautiful cover aside, \u201cBless Your Heart, Rae Sutton\u201d is a well-written book that focuses on Raeley, who\u2019s mourning the loss of her recent marriage. When she\u2019s an honorary member of her late mother\u2019s circle of friends, it perfectly weaves in love among all ages.<\/p>\n<p>What a refreshing read! It\u2019s witty, touches on love and is great if you adore that heartwarming, Southern Belle writing style.
