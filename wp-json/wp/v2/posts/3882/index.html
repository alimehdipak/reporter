tacky\"><\/p>\n<p>Sometimes it can feel like all fashion rules go out the window once the sun starts to shine.<\/p>\n<p>In the hot weather it can be tempting to just throw on your trusty denim shorts and flip flops and call it a day.<\/p>\n<p>But that\u2019s actually the last thing you should do, at least according to fashion stylist\u00a0Jess.<\/p>\n<p>The Parisian-style lover often posts fashion tips on her\u00a0YouTube channel.<\/p>\n<p>It turns out there might be more rules for summer dressing than any other time of the year, especially if you want to avoid looking cheap and tacky.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking to Fabulous, Jess revealed some of the things you should under no circumstances wear this summer and what to put on instead.<\/p>\n<h3>Things to avoid<\/h3>\n<p>The style guru confessed: \u201cThe worst item of clothing a woman could wear in the heat would have to be a polyester top.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll boil from the inside out and probably have the sweat patches to show for it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/stylist-fashion-advice-07.jpg?w=819\" alt=\"A

@fashionandstyleedit    <\/p>\n<p>And if you\u2019re jetting off abroad, or braving British beaches, definitely don\u2019t wear heels or wedges with your swimwear, Jess says \u201cit\u2019s like fingernails on a blackboard for me\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, she suggested \u201celongating your shape with the right swimsuit, flat sandals or long kimono as a coverup\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Avoid tight ankle straps too since according to the fashion lover \u201cthey can cut your leg off and make them look shorter\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Stick to neutral, tan sandals and by no means wear your Crocs outside the house, they might be alright for gardening but the truth is \u201cit\u2019s hard to make anyone\u2019s legs look good in them,\u201d Jess explained.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/stylist-fashion-advice-01.jpg?w=819\" \/>\u201cI think deep down we all know if an outfit is working, it\u2019s just a matter of truly listening to that voice,\u201d says style guru Jess. @fashionandstyleedit    <\/p>\n<p>Finding a top that is flattering and won\u2019t be too hot can be challenging.<\/p>\n<p>Jess says: \u201cIf you have the abs to pull off the current fashion trend of crop tops, whatever age you are, I say style away.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSadly my abs are not up to the job just yet!<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor a more elegant take on the trend think about layering a blazer over the top and style with high waisted linen trousers or a skirt.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Re-think your denim<\/h3>\n<p>Be careful when choosing denim shorts too, the wrong cut can make you look out of proportion.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI search for cuts that are higher waisted and will finish at the slimmest part of my legs to help elongate them a little more,\u201d Jess explained.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRaw hems help to give them more of a relaxed, bohemian vibe which I like and they\u2019ll style with just about every top you have in your wardrobe.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTry not to get sucked in adding trends just for the sake of it,\u201d Jess said.<\/p>\n<h3>Steer clear of tacky<\/h3>\n<p>While your favourite mini dress might look great, the pro said: \u201cTight and short dresses that leave little to the imagination can often make women look tacky.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think there\u2019s far more sexiness in the unsaid.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne colour outfits are an easy way to instantly look more polished and elevated, and it\u2019s a handy style tip to remember when you don\u2019t know what to wear.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFocus on finding the highest quality staples you can afford and sprinkle in the odd trend as and when you find ones that really suit you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cKeep your makeup to a minimum too, a healthy glow will always look far more stylish that a heavy base of foundation,\u201d the pro advised.<\/p>\n<h3>Pick your clothes carefully<\/h3>\n<p>Don\u2019t think you have to break the bank to avoid looking tacky, the pro says: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to spend a fortune to look chic.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBe a little bit more choosy with what you decide to buy, search out beautiful fabric compositions and opt for quality over quantity every time.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll really show in your outfit ideas.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She suggested trying \u201cA crisp cotton poplin shirt, pleated, high waisted trousers, a classic ribbed vest top, linen dresses, a breton stripe top and a lightweight cotton or linen blazer to layer over the top.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Jess added: \u201cTrue style starts from within, forget the number your birthday card reads.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you feel nice in something, you feel it flatters your shape and it gives you that little spring in your step then wear it!<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think deep down we all know if an outfit is working, it\u2019s just a matter of truly listening to that voice.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>This story originally
