In fact, you can\u2019t even see most of the creosote buildup. But there are some detrimental consequences to your property and health if you ignore this vital part of your home. So, what happens when you don\u2019t clean your chimney?<\/p>\n<h3>Cleaning chimneys is crucial to health and safety.<\/h3>\n<p>If your house has a fireplace, cleaning the chimney is an essential chore to keep everyone safe and healthy. It also prevents dangerous upshots inside your home.<\/p>\n<p>When you don\u2019t clean your chimney for too long, it will result in blockage and toxic gases build up within your home. It will start the combustion process of fires, which you aren\u2019t supposed to inhale. From serious respiratory issues to suffocation or poisoning, not cleaning a chimney is much more than a matter of your home\u2019s outside appearance.<\/p>\n<p>When creosote builds up on the chimney\u2019s inner walls, it obstructs the venting of dangerous toxins out of your home. Besides, it can also lead to a chimney fire which can quickly spread to your entire house.<\/p>\n<h3>Carbon monoxide poisoning<\/h3>\n<p>Chimneys can release toxic gases, such as carbon monoxide, into your home. Carbon monoxide is created from burning coal and wood. Since this gas has no smell, you might even not know until it causes serious health concerns. That\u2019s why you should have an alarm fitted in your home and get your chimney checked annually.<\/p>\n<p>To prevent carbon monoxide poisoning, it\u2019s important to have a regular chimney sweep and free the passage for the fumes to exhaust outside.<\/p>\n<h3>A chimney fire<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s not difficult to start a fire. All you need to do is have a perfect balance of heat, oxygen, and fuel. If your chimney has combustible soot, it can become fuel to start a fire. That\u2019s because the remaining fire ingredients, such as oxygen and heat, are already in your room and fireplace. Fires from chimneys can reach temperatures over 1,000 degrees Celsius. This can crack chimneys, and in the worst case, it can ignite nearby materials \u2013 causing a house fire.<\/p>\n<h3>Don\u2019t wait for obvious signs.<\/h3>\n<p>There are no obvious warning signs when it comes to chimney hazards. That\u2019s why the National Fire Protection Association (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nfpa.org\/\">NFPA<\/a>) recommends having your chimney inspected at least once every year to ensure your safety and its proper functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Repairs, cleaning, and maintenance are based on an inspection conducted by a chimney professional. They will come in, inspect your chimney, and tell you what needs to be cleaned or fixed.
