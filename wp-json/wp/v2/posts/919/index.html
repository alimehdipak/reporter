I think there was no right reason to leave the country after the facts that happened and with the assurance that we get.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They met, they had their own concerns, they raised them, but I think altogether we got the right assurances and explanations as well.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>McLaren team principal Andreas Seidl said it was important for the voices of all the drivers to be heard as well as those of team members working in other roles.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our drivers are the heroes of the sport and it is important they have a voice that is right for the sport they are in and therefore it makes absolutely sense that they have these discussions between them,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;At the same time, it was also important to share our different views on what happened yesterday and that&#8217;s what happened.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In the end, we all came to the same conclusion that it is right to continue with the weekend after we got the assurances that we are safe here. Let&#8217;s not forget, it&#8217;s not just about drivers and the team principles, it&#8217;s about 2000 team members of the F1 paddock here and we had to make the right decision together with F1 and the FIA, for all of us.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Five team principals appeared in Saturday&#8217;s news conference ahead of final practice and all of them said they had received assurances from Saudi Arabian authorities and security agencies about the safety of the race.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We had quite a few [meetings with] high-ranked authorities yesterday, and they explained us the situation,&#8221; Aston Martin team principal Mike Krack said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They explained it to us in a very credible way and it made all the ten of us in the room confident that they take their responsibility very seriously.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Williams team boss Jost Capito added: &#8220;There was also another defence person not from here [Saudi Arabia], but another country, who looked into that independently and looked into everything to make sure we would have a safe event.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Haas team principal Guenther Steiner said he felt reassured by members of the Saudi Arabian government bringing their families to the race.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They explained very credibly what [security] was in place,&#8221; Steiner added. &#8220;The details, the technical details, I don&#8217;t think that I am in a position to explain them, because I am not qualified enough.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There is stuff in place that protects us, obviously, but for me to explain that &#8230; I&#8217;m an amateur in that so it would be an opinion and not an explanation.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;But the credible explanation of what they are doing and that they have their families here with them, that gives me the assurance that I&#8217;m safe and that my team is safe.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia &#8212; Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto said it would have been wrong for Formula One&#8217;s drivers to boycott Sunday&#8217;s Saudi Arabian Grand Prix and leave the country in response to a missile attack 10 km from the circuit on Friday.On Friday evening, F1&#8217;s 20 drivers held a four-hour meeting in which they&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":920,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[13],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/919"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=919"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/919\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=919"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=919"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=919"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
