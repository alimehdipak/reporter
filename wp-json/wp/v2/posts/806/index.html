The original seeds still carry weight for the teams that have survived &#8212; they give us the full picture about a team&#8217;s season thus far. But what do you do with the surprises in the field?<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s what makes reseeding the Sweet 16 far more difficult than reseeding the second round. In the 2022 edition, Baylor, Kentucky and Auburn have all been eliminated. But Michigan, North Carolina, Miami and Saint Peter&#8217;s have survived.<\/p>\n<p>At this point, the reseed centers more on how far a team can go than where it started. The top of the list will look familiar, but the rest is admittedly chaotic, and the rankings reflect as much. We like UCLA, but is Jaime Jaquez Jr. going to be healthy enough to play in the Sweet 16? How much should we care about North Carolina squandering a 25-point lead against Baylor? And what if Brady Manek can&#8217;t play? Miami beat Auburn, but was that more about Miami&#8217;s recent surge or an Auburn squad that had looked flat for weeks?<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re trying to figure out.<\/p>\n<p>If this list is anything like our original bracket, we&#8217;ll rip it up and try again with the Elite Eight.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/ncaa\/500\/2250.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<p><b>1.

Christian Koloko&#8217;s dunk with 9.5 seconds to play &#8212; two of his 28 points &#8212; sealed the win for the Wildcats. Projected draft lottery pick Bennedict Mathurin (30 points, 10 rebounds, 2 steals) made a multitude of clutch plays down the stretch. The two players were too good, and TCU made too many mistakes in overtime.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, Arizona looked vulnerable (5-for-27 from 3) against a TCU squad that finished with an 8-10 record in Big 12 action. But some of the best teams in the nation failed to reach the second weekend of this year&#8217;s NCAA tournament.

This current team isn&#8217;t as strong defensively as Wright&#8217;s 2016 and 2018 national championship squads. But the 2022 Wildcats seem to be improving in the NCAA tournament.<\/p>\n<p>During its current 7-0 winning streak, Villanova&#8217;s opponents have connected on just 26.6% of their 3-point attempts. Success from beyond the arc usually has more to do with the shooter than the defender. Delaware and Ohio State, however, were both in the top five in 3-point shooting in their respective leagues, and they finished a combined 10-for-42 in that metric against Villanova. The Wildcats, meanwhile, have made 36% of their contested 3s in the NCAA tournament, which is their top mark since the 2018 national title run, according to ESPN Stats &amp; Information research.<\/p>\n<p>Collin Gillespie, a freshman on that team, is averaging 17.0 PPG and 4.0 APG. Things could tighten up for Villanova in its next game, but the No. 1 free throw shooting team in the country (82.6%) can thrive in those situations, too.<\/p>\n<p><i><b>Up next:<\/b> vs. Michigan (Thursday, 7:29 p.m. ET, TBS)<\/i><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/ncaa\/500\/150.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<p><b>6.

With 2:06 to go, Banchero made a jumper to give Duke a 75-74 lead before he blocked Joey Hauser on the other end, which set up Jeremy Roach to hit a 3 to extend the advantage to a crucial four-point gap the Spartans could not close.<\/p>\n<p>The sequence also was a reminder of Duke&#8217;s balance of both youth and talent. There were times late in the contest when it seemed as if the young Blue Devils might stumble. But Banchero (19 points, seven rebounds, four assists, one block) would not let that happen. Down the stretch, he played like the projected top-five draft pick that he is. We saw that at his best, he can do whatever Duke needs him to do to get a win.<\/p>\n<p>Five Duke players, including Banchero, recorded double figures in scoring.

Sure, it was Adams&#8217; team as soon as he agreed to take over for Chris Beard after he left for Texas last year. But the Beard storyline had lingered, and the Red Raiders and the Longhorns, 382 miles apart, were compared to one another all season.<\/p>\n<p>This Sweet 16 run belongs to Adams, whose team outscored Notre Dame 10-1 in the final 2:09 on Sunday. It was in that stretch that Texas Tech showed the same resilience that has carried it throughout this season. In those challenging moments, the Red Raiders will always be dangerous.<\/p>\n<p>Many assumed Beard was the key to the Red Raiders&#8217; success and expected their ambitions and achievements to change without him. They were wrong. The Red Raiders are ranked first in adjusted defensive efficiency on KenPom, and Bryson Williams is averaging 17.0 PPG through two NCAA tournament games.

A team with an adjusted defensive efficiency in the 90s is rarely a candidate for a Final Four run. As Texas bounced back from a 14-point deficit, it seemed as if that defensive weakness would cost Matt Painter, who lost to Beard&#8217;s Little Rock squad in the second round of the 2016 NCAA tournament.<\/p>\n<p>But Purdue&#8217;s elite offense &#8212; ranked second in adjusted efficiency &#8212; overwhelmed Texas in the final minutes of the game. A team that was in the bonus for most of the second half turned to projected lottery pick Jaden Ivey (18 points) and its big men to stay in front of a determined Longhorns squad.<\/p>\n<p>Purdue&#8217;s offensive capabilities are unique. Trevion Williams led all scorers with 22 points, and he came off the bench. Ethan Morton, a reserve who has gone scoreless in 13 games this season, recorded eight points and hit two big 3s. Zach Edey (11 points, 10 rebounds) finished with a double-double on a team that went 33-for-46 at the free throw line.<\/p>\n<p>Yeah, the defensive challenges could cost Purdue in the next round.

The Friars were a trendy pick to lose to South Dakota State in the first round and then had to tussle with a Richmond squad &#8212; which had stopped Iowa, the Big Ten tournament champion with one of the nation&#8217;s most powerful offensive attacks &#8212; in the second round.<\/p>\n<p>Providence held South Dakota State, the nation&#8217;s top 3-point shooting team, to a 7-for-23 mark (30%) from beyond the arc.

Early in the win over the Tigers on Sunday, Moore dribbled past Walker Kessler, who anticipated a drive to the rim. Instead, Moore just stopped. Kessler bumped into him and committed his first foul of the night. A second foul soon sidelined Kessler for a chunk of the first half.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s those veteran plays and moments, coupled with Moore&#8217;s overall production &#8212; he finished with 15 points, nine rebounds, eight assists and three steals against Auburn &#8212; that will send Miami to the Sweet 16 for the first time in six years. Moore, who is competing at his fourth school, will return to Chicago, his hometown, for the second weekend of the tournament after Miami thumped the SEC&#8217;s regular-season champion, which is anchored by projected lottery pick Jabari Smith (3-for-16 on Sunday).<\/p>\n<p>The Hurricanes will enter the Sweet 16 assuming they can beat anyone.

Otzelberger grew up in Milwaukee, where he defeated Wisconsin, the premier Division I program in his home state, on Sunday. In doing so, he led his team to the Sweet 16 for the sixth time in school history &#8212; and for the second time since 2016. He had always viewed Iowa State as his dream job, and now the Cyclones, in his first season, have gone from a two-win team a year ago to a second-weekend team. Izaiah Brockington (17.3 PPG, 7.0 rebounds per game) has been his top player, but Tyrese Hunter (23 points in the first-round win over LSU), Gabe Kalscheur (a game-high 22 points on Sunday) and other players have been tapped to lead, too.<\/p>\n<p>Once you get past the romantic storyline of this team&#8217;s rise, remember that the Cyclones have forced turnovers on 25.5% of their opponents&#8217; possessions since March 1. Wisconsin, No. 1 nationally in turnover rate entering the game, coughed up the ball 17 times.<\/p>\n<p>The Cyclones don&#8217;t have any sexy metrics to call them a Final Four sleeper.

Shaheen Holloway has spent the past few days highlighting his team&#8217;s New York and New Jersey swagger and toughness. Sure, some of that is just coaching clich\u00e9s.

Until that point in the season, the Peacocks&#8217; opponents had connected on 48% of their 2-point attempts (85th in the country, per Barttorvik.com). During their current 10-game winning streak &#8212; extended by Saturday&#8217;s victory against a Murray State squad that hadn&#8217;t lost a game in more than three months &#8212; the Peacocks have boasted America&#8217;s top defense inside the 3-point line, with a 35.8% clip allowed. Kentucky (47.8% inside the arc) and Murray State (35.7%) both struggled to get shots that had otherwise fallen all season against an undersized Saint Peter&#8217;s squad, which is on its way to the second weekend with a tangibly improved defense.<\/p>\n<p><i><b>Up next:<\/b> vs. Purdue (Friday, 7:09 p.m. ET, CBS)<\/i><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Well, now it gets interesting.It&#8217;s at this point in the NCAA tournament that things generally stop making sense.
