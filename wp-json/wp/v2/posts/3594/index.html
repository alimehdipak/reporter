Day and night, the garage door is summoned to open and close as the vehicles move in and out. As mentioned, the lift is due to a torsion spring that wears and tears with time.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Most doors weigh around three hundred pounds; this is where the use of torsion springs comes in handy. They easily lift up the door with the help of motor devices. Unfortunately, they do not last forever. Since most of the work is dependent on them, their life is shorter compared to other parts of the system.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Types of Torsion Garage Door Springs<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before understanding the signs to look out for, let\u2019s see how many types of torsion <a href=\"https:\/\/www.publishingbooth.com\/lifestyle\/home-improvement\/what-are-the-benefits-of-a-glass-garage-door\/\">garage<\/a> door springs are there.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Standard<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">They are the most affordable option and are commonly used in residential setups.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Steel rolling door torsion springs<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Multiple springs are found inside the torsion barrel, which helps the rolling door make it an apt choice for commercial construction.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Early set torsion spring<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This type is used in residential projects. The spring is placed in the middle of the torsion shaft.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Torque master torsion spring<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is the safest option due to the two spring system which is situated inside the shaft.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here are a few signs that indicate that your spring needs attention.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Incomplete opening of the door<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If the door is not opening completely, then you should look for troubleshooting options. Make sure that the power switch is working fine. If that is not the issue, then it indicates a problem with the spring. Open the door manually to check; it would not stay open if the springs are broken.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Strange noise when opening the door<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It usually marks a spring problem when the door starts making loud noises going up or down.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The door rolls down quickly<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Balancing is one of the properties that torsion spring possesses. This helps to stop it from closing abruptly. When the springs stop functioning, the balance does not work, and no resistance is there to halt the door. This is a major red flag as it can potentially harm children and adults alike.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Pop sound when the door shuts<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you hear this pop when the door starts to close, it means that the spring has broken off.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Weakened elasticity<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elasticity is a property that gives the springs their bounce. Over time this quality wears off, and movement is hindered. The doors feel heavy, and movement has a lot of resistance.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How do torsion springs work?<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A typical <a href=\"https:\/\/blogbuzzer.weebly.com\/blog\/choosing-the-right-garage-door-for-your-home\">garage door<\/a> has two torsion springs, each with a pulley attached to cables. When you turn on the motor device, the pulley twists and cables pull the door up. The spring uncoils, which releases energy that lifts the door. When the door closes, springs wind up and store energy which is released next time the door sets to open.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Due to the stored energy in the springs, it becomes hazardous. Regular people should avoid dealing with it themselves without expert help since it can result in an injury.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It is often thought that a motor lifts the garage door up, while in reality, it is the job of a torsion spring.
