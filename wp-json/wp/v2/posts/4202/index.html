It took five years to heal and there is still a scar there on my upper thigh,\u201d she said. <\/p>\n<p>Now, on July 9, Lane will compete in her country\u2019s top beauty pageant, Miss Universe Great Britain. Onstage, she will model swimwear and an evening gown, as well as answer a question in front of the audience. She will also interview with the judges privately.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"975\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/harriotte-lane-03.jpg?w=975\" alt=\"Harriotte Lane\" \/>Lane still has a large scar on her thigh from undergoing skin grafts and surgery.

They have often overcome adversities.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"958\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/07\/harriotte-lane-04.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Harriotte Lane\" \/>Lane got into pageants to help gain back confidence after her accident.
