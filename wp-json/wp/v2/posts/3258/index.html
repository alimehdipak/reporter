I mean, I\u2019m sure that we will have walkouts within the first five minutes of the movie. I\u2019m sure of that,\u201d he predicted.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSome people who have seen the film have said that they think the last 20 minutes will be very hard on people, and that there\u2019ll be a lot of walkouts. Some guy said that he almost had a panic attack.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>The movie welcomed the return of Cronenberg\u2019s body-horror style, a genre that the Canadian film director is credited with creating. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/crimes-future-grabs-008.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"L\u00e9a Seydoux licking an open wound\" \/>Cronenberg expected that audience members wouldn\u2019t be able to handle his grotesque body-horror style.

Stewart plays Timlin, an investigator looking into Accelerated Evolution Syndrome, the disease that allows Mortensen and Seydoux to carry out their performance.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs the human species adapts to a synthetic environment, the body undergoes new transformations and mutations. Accompanied by his partner, celebrity performance artist Saul Tenser [Mortensen] showcases the metamorphosis of his organs. Meanwhile, a mysterious group tries to use Saul\u2019s notoriety to shed light on the next phase of human evolution,\u201d the synopsis explains. <\/p>\n<p>Well aware of Cronenberg\u2019s body horror, Buchanan noted \u201cthe most shocking thing\u201d about the film was Stewart\u2019s \u201coutlandish voice\u201d claiming that her Oscar-nominated role in <br \/>\u201d \u2018Spencer\u2018 must have truly unlocked something within her.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The film is competing for the Palme d\u2019Or (the highest honor at Cannes Film Festival) and is set to be released June 2. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Audience members sickened by horrific scenes in \u201cCrimes of the Future\u201d reportedly walked out of the premiere at the Cannes Film Festival Monday.
