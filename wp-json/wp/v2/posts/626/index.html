Melanie claimed that the first round of cuts in her audition were made after casting directors lined everyone up and gave them a once over. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t prove anything, it\u2019s just what some strangers think your face looks like,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t earn it really, which is hard. It\u2019s hard to accept.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Sarah Daniels, 32, who worked at Disney parks and cruises as Mickey Mouse, Alice, Wendy, Tinker Bell, Ariel and young Elsa for nearly a decade, agreed with Melanie\u2019s claims. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very funny quote for her. Good for her,\u201d Daniels told The Post. <\/p>\n<p>The musical-theater actress said casting directors like \u201ceveryone to look like each other\u201d so that there is continuity when different people play the same role.<\/p>\n<p>Daniels also said that snagging a role as a face character is about \u201chaving normal features\u201d \u2014 as well as the correct height and size. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt might not even be about your face,\u201d she said. She explained that the parks are mostly searching for someone who fits the costume and looks good in the wig. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a thousand white women who look like Cinderella,\u201d Daniels said. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"752\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/Sarah-Daniels-4-e1647895383740.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Sarah Daniels as young Elsa \" \/>Daniels claimed that being cast as a Disney parks princess isn\u2019t about being \u201cconventionally pretty\u201d but \u201chaving normal features\u201d and fitting into their costumes.

You\u2019re just a chick in a wig,\u201d she said. <\/p>\n<p>And once Daniels was upgraded to a performer, two members of Disney\u2019s casting team pointed out that the 21-year-old\u2019s 5-foot, 115-pound figure didn\u2019t match the Little Mermaid Ariel\u2019s 16-year-old cartoon frame, which sent her spiraling into an eating disorder that lasted past her Disney days. <\/p>\n<p>A \u201csilhouette issue\u201d is a common fear for women cast in these roles, particularly those who play Ariel and splash around in her grotto in only a mermaid tail and bikini top. <\/p>\n<p>Daniels also posts TikToks as @sarahdanielstv about her time at \u201cThe Happiest Place on Earth\u201d and said there seems to be never-ending interest about her experiences. <\/p>\n<p>Disney did not respond to The Post for a comment. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think there\u2019s this weird thing about being a Disney princess. Women imagine that being told you\u2019re beautiful enough to be a princess will give them confidence and validation because you\u2019ve done the best you can do,\u201d Daniels said. <\/p>\n<p> But, she added: \u201cIt\u2019s a coveted thing. It\u2019s not a magical thing.\u201d <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Disney memories are meant to last forever, but not when it comes to princesses.
