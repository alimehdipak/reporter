We wanted to push the Brewers forward, be respectful of our history and be respectful of the great things about Milwaukee that our fans love.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The look&#8217;s overall color palette is inspired by the People&#8217;s Flag of Milwaukee. The powder blue base reflects the summer sky of Milwaukee; the yellow represents the sun; and the navy trim pays homage to Lake Michigan.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/mlb\/story\/_\/id\/34102731\/\" \/>Milwaukee Brewers<\/p>\n<p>The jersey features the city&#8217;s nickname for the team, &#8220;Brew Crew&#8221;  in a font meant to honor the city&#8217;s industrial past with a modern spin nodding to the city&#8217;s cultural renaissance in recent years. The hats feature the city&#8217;s area code, 414, and the MKE across the front is the city&#8217;s airport abbreviation.<\/p>\n<p>The right sleeve features a grill patch, a nod to the city&#8217;s culture around outdoor grilling in the summer and a staple at Brewers games. The yellow and white piping represents the foam head on a beer.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/mlb\/story\/_\/id\/34102731\/\" \/>Milwaukee Brewers<\/p>\n<p>Schlesinger said that the team&#8217;s uniform redesign efforts for 2020 helped inform the process and that the uniforms received a positive reaction from players.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The players love it. The 25-year-olds who are playing our games on the field are the type of people we want to buy this stuff,&#8221; Schlesinger said. &#8220;If the players are excited about it, that&#8217;s huge.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Brewers hope this uniform helps push the team forward and appeals to a new generation of fans.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Baseball has this reputation of being somewhat conservative and resistant to change,&#8221; Schlesinger said. &#8220;These kinds of things can demonstrate that maybe the stereotype isn&#8217;t true. That might have been true of 1980s baseball, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s true today, and we think we can add to the notion that baseball is listening and we&#8217;re part of the culture that we&#8217;re embracing, that we can be fun and edgy and stay true to the elements of the game.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Milwaukee Brewers unveiled their City Connect uniform, inspired by the People&#8217;s Flag of Milwaukee, the city&#8217;s summer skies, grilling culture and Lake Michigan.
