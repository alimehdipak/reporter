He knows (but won\u2019t admit it) that viewers are tuning in to the newscast for Helen; their on-camera smiles disguise the icy off-camera friction between.<\/p>\n<p>The \u201cNews at Six\u201d team also includes young, fresh-faced producer\/reporter Dale Jennings (Sam Reid), who\u2019s hoping for his big break as a newsreader and snaring that all-important morning \u201cupdate\u201d segment  \u2014 but muffs it, big-time, when he fills in for Helen after she storms out of the station following a loud fight with her boss, news chief Lindsay Cunningham (William McInnes) \u2014 after he calls her \u201ca war zone on two legs\u201d and says she has \u201ca face like a slapped a\u2013.\u201d He knows that Helen is the network news division\u2019s bread-and-butter and he tells her as much \u2026 in his own un-PC way.

They venture into a romance, while he finds himself attracted to cameraman Tim Ahern (Chai Hansen) amidst rumblings, as one of his co-workers says, that he\u2019s \u201ca poof.\u201d  <\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Helen\u2019s testy relationship with her older co-anchor Geoff (and his wife, who\u2019s not a fan) is tested when he makes an unexpected announcement at his 60th birthday party \u2014 and counts on Dale as an ally in the newsroom.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Newsreader,\u201d which premiered last summer on Australia\u2019s ABC Network, snared five AACTA Awards (the country\u2019s version of the Emmys and Oscars combined), including Torv as Best Lead Actress in a Drama and McInnes as Best Supporting Actor in a Drama. They\u2019re all well-deserved. Torv plays Helen as a whirlwind of emotions, ambition and empathy who won\u2019t give in to the sexism of her colleagues and bosses, however obvious or subtle, while McInnes adds subtle shading to his role as the demanding, demeaning, cajoling, understanding and intuitive news chief. <\/p>\n<p>Kudos, too, for Reid, Taylor and Hansen \u2014 who all turn in strong performances \u2014 and to series creator\/co-writer Michael Lucas for recapturing the tenor of the times. <\/p>\n<p>While \u201cThe Newsreader\u201d is set in Australia, the behavior and mores of the \u201cNews at Six\u201d newsroom was universal and commonplace for its time.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There\u2019s a hint of the 1987 movie \u201cBroadcast News\u201d in \u201cThe Newsreader,\u201d a new six-episode drama premiering Friday (March 18) on Roku.
