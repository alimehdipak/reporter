Odds are, not much, since historically a groom\u2019s options have been pretty limited, with nowhere near the many varied options brides enjoy.<\/p>\n<p>But grooms \u2014 fret no longer. Thanks to designers and celebrities taking more style risks on the runway and red carpet, guys have more choice and inspiration in the design, color and accessories than ever before.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cToday, guys are more aware of trends and they want to bring their individual style in new ways,\u201d said Jeff Jones, vice-president of merchandising for Joseph Abboud.<\/p>\n<p>When shopping for a suit or tuxedo, think about what your partner will be wearing. \u201cThe couple\u2019s attire sets the tone for the formality of the event. The groom should always be a level more formal than the expectations of their guests,\u201d said Carrie Goldberg, founder and creative director of CLG Creative.<\/p>\n<p>Formality can be dictated by where the wedding will be held, as well as the time of day. A tuxedo, for example, is more appropriate after 6 p.m., while a suit can be worn at any time.<\/p>\n<p>      <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"387\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/JCREW_AU428-1.jpg?w=387\" alt=\"Getting married during the day calls for a more relaxed look.

If an event specifies, it\u2019s highly recommended you respect this and dress accordingly.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>White tuxedo jackets are having a bit of a moment. Associated with destination weddings, summertime affairs and tropical settings, Jones said that it\u2019s the James Bond effect. \u201cIt innately brings a sense of cool to the groom.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Personalization, as with all the wedding\u2019s details, is a great way for a couple or individual to convey their personality and style.<\/p>\n<p>      <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"450\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/Musika_navy_suit.jpg?w=450\" alt=\"For a semi-formal affair, Musika\u2019s wool silk two-piece suit with peak lapels in navy can be dressed up or down. $2,900, by appointment only.\" \/>For a semi-formal affair, Musika\u2019s wool silk two-piece suit with peak lapels in navy can be dressed up or down. $2,900, by appointment only.Handout      <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"450\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/Brooks_Brothers_seersucker-1.jpg?w=450\" alt=\"Dress down, yet still dapper, in Brooks Brothers\u2019 Milano Slim-fit stretch seersucker stripe sport coat and pants.

It\u2019s a great way to wear a more traditional tuxedo or suit but add his own touch.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And like a bride, it\u2019s not uncommon for a groom to change into a second look for the reception, \u201ceither by changing the style of suit from formal tuxedo to disco tux or simply changing jackets,\u201d said Goldberg. \u201cWe do recommend that grooms purchase a second shirt, given that they are likely to sweat through the first one.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Above all, Goldberg said that fit and quality are paramount. \u201cRegardless of how beautiful the material is, an ill-fitting suit is possibly the biggest sin in menswear.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How much attention is paid to what a groom will wear on his wedding day?
