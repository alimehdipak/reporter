He left for less than a minute of game time after the injury and moved gingerly in the second half&#8217;s final minutes. Tar Heels coach Hubert Davis said Bacot was slated to practice Sunday but stressed that the team&#8217;s entire workout would be limited. He said that the X-rays on Bacot were negative and the swelling wasn&#8217;t overwhelming.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s ready to play tomorrow night,&#8221; Davis said.<\/p>\n<p>Bacot is the most difficult player for UNC to replace if he&#8217;s limited. He&#8217;s the program&#8217;s leading scorer (16.3 PPG) and rebounder (13.1 RPG), and his rebounding total ranks No. 3 in the country. He ranks No. 8 in defensive rebound percentage (30.2%) and No. 21 in offensive rebound percentage (14.9%), per KenPom.com.<\/p>\n<p>Bacot said on Sunday that he has been treated almost constantly since the game ended. After the X-rays, he said he spent two hours treating the ankle and then woke up and got into the pool to rehab on Sunday morning. He said that while working on a homework assignment for a sports facilities class on Sunday morning, he kept the ankle in compression sleeves. While meeting with the media Sunday afternoon he said he had stimulation treatment on it.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have another big man,&#8221; Bacot said, &#8220;so I don&#8217;t have a choice.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The options that the Tar Heels have behind Bacot aren&#8217;t appealing. They could move 6-foot-9 forward Brady Manek to the 5-spot, which he played frequently against Kansas while at Oklahoma. That would create a difficult mismatch inside for UNC against Kansas&#8217; David McCormack, who is coming off a season-high 25-point blitz against Villanova.<\/p>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p>McCormack is a 6-foot-10, 250-pound forward whose comfort with contact made him a human bowling ball on Saturday night. He celebrated with self-congratulatory muscle flexes on a night in which he went 10-for-12 from the floor with nine rebounds.<\/p>\n<p>Davis went as far as to say the winner of the national title on Monday night &#8220;could ultimately come down to the winner of that matchup.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>If Bacot is limited in the title game and UNC wants Manek to avoid playing post defense against McCormack, the Heels could turn to either reserve forwards Justin McKoy (6-8, 220) or Dontrez Styles (6-6, 210). None of those options are attractive for UNC.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have any other big men,&#8221; Bacot said. &#8220;If I don&#8217;t play, who knows what Dave McCormack may do?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The absence of 6-11 forward Dawson Garcia from the UNC roster could loom large if Bacot is limited or again finds foul trouble. Garcia, a Marquette transfer, last played for UNC on Jan. 22; the school announced in February he wouldn&#8217;t return because of family medical issues.<\/p>\n<p>That has afforded Bacot more of a chance to dominate. In the NCAA tournament, he has averaged 16.8 rebounds through five games. That included 21 rebounds against Duke and 22 against Saint Peter&#8217;s. &#8220;I feel like the best big in the country,&#8221; Bacot said.<\/p>\n<p>Bacot spent about a minute writhing on the ground in pain on Saturday night against Duke after it appeared he stepped on the foot of teammate Leaky Black with 5:18 remaining. He limped to the bench without putting weight on his right leg, his arms draped around two teammates for the walk across the court.<\/p>\n<p>He initially said he was in so much pain he wasn&#8217;t even thinking about going back in the game. Bacot walked around toward the tunnel at the UNC bench, and said a pep talk from trainer Doug Halverson gave him an adrenaline boost. Halverson mentioned Joel Berry overcoming ankle injuries in the run to the 2017 national title without any treatment.<\/p>\n<p>When a teammate asked him about his health upon checking back in the game with 4:36 left, Bacot recalls saying a more profane version of the phrase: &#8220;Forget it.&#8221; That was captured on video and made the rounds on social media. He added Sunday: &#8220;I mean, there&#8217;s four minutes left for the national championship [game].&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Bacot said on Sunday that he didn&#8217;t think UNC would have won the game if he didn&#8217;t come back and play those four minutes. He fouled out with 46.7 seconds left.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Apr 3, 2022Pete ThamelESPN NEW ORLEANS &#8212; North Carolina star big man Armando Bacot plans to play in the national championship game against Kansas on Monday night.Bacot sprained his right ankle in UNC&#8217;s 81-77 win over Duke in the Final Four on Saturday.
