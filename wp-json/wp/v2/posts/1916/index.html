Dorsey is also leaving Twitter\u2019s board of directors when his current term expires at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in late May.<\/p>\n<p>Dorsey has yet to comment directly on Musk\u2019s offer to buy Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>Musk offered to buy Twitter at $54.20 per share last week after backing out of an agreement to take a seat on the company\u2019s board following disagreements over the company\u2019s future. Before that agreement fell apart, Dorsey tweeted that he was \u201creally happy\u201d Musk would be joining the board.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>I\u2019m really happy Elon is joining the Twitter board!

The Tesla CEO has demanded that Twitter\u2019s board allow shareholders to vote on his offer.<\/p>\n<p>The billionaire responded to a user who shared a chart showing that Twitter chairman Bret Taylor and other board members only owned a tiny portion of the company\u2019s stock.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWow, with Jack departing, the Twitter board collectively owns almost no shares!
