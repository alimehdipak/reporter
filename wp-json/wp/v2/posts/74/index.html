That inaugural show was partly financed by Russia\u2019s Alfa Bank, Russia\u2019s largest private financial institution, which was sanctioned by the US Department of the Treasury last month. <\/p>\n<p>One of the bank\u2019s founders, Fridman \u2014\u00a0who, as of 2017, was Russia\u2019s seventh-richest citizen \u2014 was a client of the Gagosian Gallery, and sanctioned by the European Union in February. He resigned from the bank\u2019s board earlier this month, according to reports. <\/p>\n<p>Fridman bought an Andy Warhol painting of Marilyn Monroe through the gallery for more than $38 million in 2013. he then flipped the 1962 acrylic and silk-screen \u201cFour Marilyns\u201d two years later for $44 million.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/damien-hirst-midas.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Damien Hirst Midas and the Infinite  butterflies, manufactured diamonds and enamel paint on canvas.\" \/>Through Gagosian, Fridman bought one of the paintings from Damien Hirst\u2019s \u201cMidas\u201d series.Prudence Cumming    <\/p>\n<p>At the beginning of his business relationship with Gagosian, Fridman had bought \u201cMidas,\u201d a monochrome painting of butterflies in a gilded cage, by Hirst from the Gagosian Gallery. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cGagosian is no different from all the other art dealers who were circling around the money trough of the oligarchs,\u201d said an art world source who did not want to be identified. \u201cEverybody, including Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s were shamelessly courting the oligarchs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But Gagosian, whose net worth is estimated at $600 million, may have been better than most at courting these billionaire clients. His gallery is the most successful modern dealership in the world, with outposts in Geneva, Los Angeles and even a hangar at a Paris airport. The nearly 18,000-square-foot space near a runway at Le Bourget has featured exhibitions of Gagosian artists Richard Serra and Anselm Kiefer, among others.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/andy-warhol.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" \/>Andy Warhol\u2019s \u201cFour Marilyns\u201d is one of the paintings Fridman bought through Gagosian\u2019s gallery.Anadolu Agency\/Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cLarry occupies a unique position that hasn\u2019t been reached by any dealer in the history of art and will never be reached after him, said fellow contemporary art dealer Philippe Segalot in a 2018 interview with allinet, an online art journal. \u201cHe is the greatest on the market. He is a true military machine.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To that end, Gagosian has maintained a close connection with the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia, and its longtime director Mikhail Piotrovsky, who is so close to Putin that he boasted about helping the Russian president draft constitutional amendments in 2020. Piotrovsky\u2019s wife Irina worked with Putin for six years while he was deputy mayor of St. Petersburg in the early 1990s. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/Mikhail-Piotrovsky-02.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Russian President Vladimir Putin (left) with Mikhail Piotrovsky, who has been wined and dined by Gagosian.\" \/>Russian President Vladimir Putin with Mikhail Piotrovsky, who has been wined and dined by Gagosian.ALEXEI DRUZHININ    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m Putin\u2019s person since the early \u201990s,\u201d said Piotrovsy in an interview with the Art Newspaper last year. \u201cPutin has been my person from the early \u201990s. He is from Petersburg. He had approximately the same job that I did. We both worked for the reputation of Petersburg. So indeed he is closer to me than many others.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In partnership with Piotrovsky, Gagosian has staged several art exhibitions of his clients\u2019 work at the Hermitage in the past, and wined and dined Piotrovsky on his numerous trips to the US. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/Mikhail-Piotrovsky-01.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Piotrovsky (above), the long-time director of the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia, is so close to Putin that he boasted about helping the Russian president draft constitutional amendments in 2020.\" \/>Piotrovsky, the long-time director of the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia, is so close to Putin that he boasted about helping the Russian president draft constitutional amendments in 2020.Ken Faught    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy relations with Dr. Piotrovsky are excellent,\u201d said Gagosian, the son of Armenian emigr\u00e9s in a 2018 interview. \u201cAfter all, he is half-Armenian.

In Washington, he was given a private tour of the Library of Congress and awarded the Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service. He even laid a wreath at Mount Vernon where George Washington is buried, according to tax filings.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/larry-gagosian-francis-bacon-03.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Gagosian's galleries have included pieces by artists Francis Bacon (above) and Damien Hirst.\" \/>Gagosian\u2019s galleries have included pieces by artists Francis Bacon (above) and Damien Hirst.Guy Bell\/Shutterstock    <\/p>\n<p>In 2017, \u201cLarry Gagosian graciously hosted an intimate dinner for Professor Piotrovsky and several art collectors in his home,\u201d according to the Hermitage Museum Foundation\u2019s website. <\/p>\n<p>Abramovich, who made international headlines when he paid $86.3 million for Francis Bacon\u2019s\u00a0\u201cTriptych\u201d\u00a0and another $33.6 million for Lucian Freud\u2019s\u00a0\u201cBenefits Supervisor Sleeping\u201d in 2008, was added to the British sanctions list of \u201cpro-Kremlin\u201d oligarchs with ties to the UK.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>New York\u2019s most successful art tycoon has built a billion-dollar empire by being the dealer of choice for Russia\u2019s biggest oligarchs.
