JT Santini    <\/p>\n<p>Event planner Sofia Crokos (who also co-owns the Greek restaurant Elaia Estiatorio in Bridgehampton) agrees. She\u2019s carved out a niche planning high-end Hamptons bashes. Per-head spending on the five wedding weekends she\u2019s masterminding this summer is 40% higher than the last pre-pandemic season. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe vibe, the excitement is coming back to life. It\u2019s almost like they\u2019ve let themselves out of a cage and said, \u2018Let\u2019s go,\u2019 \u201d Crokos laughs. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/Hamptons-Wedding-Sonia-Crokos-03.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Tents at a wedding venue\" \/>Event planner Sofia Crokos is known for her high-end weddings (above) \u2014 she says couples are now spending 40% more per guest than they did before the pandemic.  Christian Oth Studio    <\/p>\n<p>One cognac-mad client has asked her to create a sampling station for his favorites and a lounge area where guests can sip on Louis XIII and co., while another has tasked her with creating a globe-trotting assortment of snacks scattered around the venue, a nod to a love of travel that\u2019s been so hard to indulge in recent years. And no wedding Out East is now complete without one amenity, she says: a Kardashian-endorsed, skin-smoothing MirMir photo booth.<\/p>\n<p>The event planner says she tries to nod to the local area in every Hamptons-based wedding she throws \u2014 serving vodka from Sagaponack Farm Distillery, perhaps \u2014 and triple-checks every potential booking against the social calendar Out East. She\u2019ll counsel clients to wait if, say, their date clashes with the Hampton Classic horse show. \u201cIt turns into something a little cuckoo out here \u2014 the traffic, the hotel bookings \u2014 so it\u2019s good if they\u2019re not married to a weekend.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"701\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/alexa-wedding-6.jpg?w=701\" alt=\"Exterior of lovebirds Chris and Lyz Brandt in Southampton.\" \/>Meaney also created beautiful blooms for the wedding of Chris and Lyz Brandt (pictured with their pooch, Otto) in Southampton. Jessica Schmitt Photography    <\/p>\n<p>Dobi Trendafilova is director of operations for Le Bilboquet restaurant group and oversees its Sag Harbor outpost, among others. <\/p>\n<p>The elegant wharf-side eatery had such an avalanche of requests for weddings this summer that Trendafilova made an exception to the rule of keeping June through August marriage-free; four couples, all with families who are longtime restaurant regulars, are planning to get married there over that period this summer. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/Hamptons-Wedding-Le-Bilboquet-11.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Le Bilboquet Sag Harbor\" \/>Le Bilboquet restaurant in Sag Harbor is hosting several weddings this summer.Courtesy of Le Bilboquet Sag Harbor    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo many events were canceled in the last two years, and people are really looking forward to having a good time, so we decided to be more accommodating,\u201d she says. <\/p>\n<p>Many jet-setting Hamptons couples, she adds, held off holding ceremonies for reasons other than New York\u2019s constraints on event sizes: border closures and travel-related red tape made it too hard to host long-haul loved ones until this summer.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/alexa-wedding-8.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Side by side of Roundtree's dining options and seating. \" \/>The Roundtree resort in Amagansett (left) and event planner Crokos (see her magic, right) are also preparing for a season of spare-no-expense extravaganzas. Christian Oth Studio; Roundtree    <\/p>\n<p>Sylvia Wong agrees. The lawyer-turned-hotelier owns and runs Amagansett\u2019s 15-room Roundtree resort, which opened in the summer of 2020. This month, she\u2019ll host the wedding of a couple whose nuptials were twice postponed because many of the bride\u2019s beloveds lived oversees and faced similar travel hurdles. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey sighed with relief that it\u2019s actually happening,\u201d Wong says. This summer, the Roundtree is booked for six weddings, most for between 200 and 250 guests and slated for May through June and September through October. (They\u2019re spaced out enough to allow its lawns to recover.) Wong agrees that big-day spending has surged. \u201cTypically, you just have a dance floor in the middle of the tent, but we have one couple who\u2019s building one across the entire tent, and another that\u2019s bringing their own furniture in,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>Another boho-chic couple has scheduled an entire weekend of spare-no-expense wedding festivities, including yoga sessions on the property, a farm-to-table supper and a late-night DJ.<\/p>\n<p>And there\u2019s a specific reason many NYC couples are opting for a wedding Out East this summer \u2014 at least according to officiant Sarah Ritchie. She just helmed a wedding for a Manhattan couple in Montauk, where the bride\u2019s family has long spent summers. The couple struggled to secure a wedding license in the city, as the clerk\u2019s office remains only sporadically open, a lockdown-era holdover.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat administrative glitch can be a real challenge,\u201d Ritchie says of nabbing the vital legal document. \u201cIt varies so much by locality, but it\u2019s much easier out here than in the city.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And easygoing is the new high maintenance when it comes to the fanciest weddings, a vibe shift that Topiaire\u2019s Meaney has experienced firsthand: Floral displays are less formal, and more eclectic, with brides much less insistent on identical arrangements for every surface. \u201cThey\u2019ve gotten a whole lot more chill after everything that\u2019s happened, which is much more enjoyable to work with,\u201d she laughs. \u201cEveryone has let go a little bit. They\u2019re just so happy they\u2019re having a big wedding at all.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you\u2019re planning a wedding on the East End this summer, it\u2019s go big or go home. \u201cThe pendulum has definitely swung,\u201d says Erin Hattrick Meaney, owner of Southampton\u2019s Topiaire Flower Shop&#8230;.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":3484,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[7],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3483"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3483"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3483\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":6633,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3483\/revisions\/6633"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3483"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3483"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3483"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
