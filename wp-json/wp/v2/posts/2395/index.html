And that sperm-brow aesthetic spread in epidemic proportions, filtering down to the masses in such in a way that a class action lawsuit against Tweezerman tweezers should have been filed before the turn of the 21st century.<\/p>\n<p>We thought we had collectively left it behind but the barely there brow pops up now and again. Over the last few years, Bella Hadid has sported the thin version and in 2018 Rihanna appeared on the cover of British Vogue with the dramatic editorial look. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"705\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/Kendall_Jenner_eyebrows6.jpg?w=705\" alt=\"Jenner's barely there brows made waves at the Met Gala\" \/>Jenner\u2019s barely there brows made waves at the Met Gala.Getty Images for The Met Museum\/    <\/p>\n<p>But one expert says to rest easy \u2014 and put down the tweezers. While numerous dubious \u201990s trends \u2014 from bike shorts to chokers \u2014 have made a comeback, our eyebrows remain safe. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is one \u201990s trend that we will not revisit,\u201d Jasen Kaplan, a makeup artist who works with Kelly Osbourne, Tinsley Mortimer and Naomi Campbell told The Post. He said Jenner\u2019s brows were slathered in Brow Engineer from Sensorium which is a heavily tinted pomade that was used to essentially blank them out.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"755\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/Drew_Barrymore_eyebrows2.jpg?w=755\" alt=\"Drew Barrymore was a shrimp brow enthusiast in the 90s.\" \/>Drew Barrymore was a shrimp brow enthusiast in the \u201990s.Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>Kaplan noted that we are still feeling the effects of our barely there beauty transgressions, decades later.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe people from my age group [old millennials and Gen Xers] and people from NJ, we have that decimated brow to replace. You cannot recover from the over-tweeze. Back then they didn\u2019t know the damage they were causing. My microblader is still booked out months from now,\u201d Kaplan said.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/Gwen_Stefani_eyebrows4.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"No Doubt, Gwen Stefani was a brow offender in her youth\" \/>Gwen Stefani was a brow offender in her youth.Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>But Kaplan, who claimed Tiktoker Charli D\u2019Amelio has the most desirable brows at the moment, noted that there has been a shift in the aesthetic. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe big bushy brow is back. Hair strands are back and we are getting away from the Instagram brow, where it looks like it was painted on with a stencil,\u201d he said.
