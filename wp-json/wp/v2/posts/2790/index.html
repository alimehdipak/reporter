He also became the first player in major league history with multiple three-run home runs (or a grand slam) from the ninth inning on in a game.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Nothing surprises me what he can do with the bat,&#8221; teammate Franmil Reyes said. &#8220;That was amazing. A legendary moment.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Andr\u00e9s Gim\u00e9nez led off the ninth inning with a homer and then doubled home a run in the 10th as the Guardians snapped Chicago&#8217;s six-game winning streak. They have won eight of 10 following a seven-game skid.<\/p>\n<p>It was the first multihomer game for Naylor, back from a horrific leg injury last season. He is 10-for-17 with runners in scoring position this year.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/photo\/2022\/0506\/r1009135_1296x1296_1-1.jpg&amp;w=130&amp;h=130&amp;scale=crop&amp;location=center\" width=\"65\" height=\"65\" \/><\/li>\n<li><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/photo\/2022\/0503\/r1007867_1296x1296_1-1.jpg&amp;w=130&amp;h=130&amp;scale=crop&amp;location=center\" width=\"65\" height=\"65\" \/><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>1 Related<\/p>\n<p>Naylor launched his first career slam off Liam Hendriks, handing the All-Star closer his first blown save since April 8.<\/p>\n<p>Naylor&#8217;s go-ahead drive came off Ryan Burr and barely cleared the right-field fence. Burr (0-1) started the 11th in place of Reynaldo Lopez, who felt lower back tightness while warming up and left the game.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It stings,&#8221; Hendriks said. &#8220;It should have been something I should have taken care of. We were one strike away and I couldn&#8217;t get it done. That&#8217;s what stings the most.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Burr was equally remorseful.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It sucks,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Some days you&#8217;re the windshield, some days you&#8217;re the bug. I was the bug today. I got squashed. It sucks to let this team down.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Emmanuel Clase (1-2) allowed a run in the 10th but earned the win. Trevor Stephan pitched a perfect 11th for his second major league save and first this season.<\/p>\n<p>White Sox starter Michael Kopech allowed two hits through six innings, and Chicago got three-run homers from Gavin Sheets and AJ Pollock to build a big lead. But four errors, which tied a season high set April 20 in the first game of a doubleheader, haunted the White Sox.<\/p>\n<p>Sheets dropped a line drive to right field with two outs in the first that allowed the Guardians&#8217; first run to score. Chicago shortstop Tim Anderson and third baseman Yoan Moncada committed costly errors in the ninth.<\/p>\n<p>The White Sox loaded the bases on three walks in the bottom of the ninth, but third baseman Jose Ramirez made a diving stop and Naylor stretched far at first base to field the throw for the final out of the inning.<\/p>\n<p>Kopech lowered his ERA to 0.93, and his six innings tied a career high set Aug. 26, 2018, at Detroit.<\/p>\n<p>The game marked the return of Moncada and the White Sox debut of reliever Joe Kelly. Moncada hadn&#8217;t played this season because of a right oblique strain. Kelly, who was out due to a right biceps nerve injury, pitched a scoreless seventh.<\/p>\n<p><i>Information from ESPN&#8217;s Jesse Rogers and The Associated Press was used in this report.<\/i><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>CHICAGO &#8212; Josh Naylor hit a tying grand slam with two outs in the ninth inning and a three-run homer in the 11th, powering a huge comeback that carried the Cleveland Guardians past the Chicago White Sox 12-9 on Monday night.Naylor also had a run-scoring double in the eighth and finished with eight RBIs for&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":2791,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[13],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2790"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2790"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2790\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2790"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2790"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2790"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
