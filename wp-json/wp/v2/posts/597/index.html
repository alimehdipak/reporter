No need for oral surgery<\/h3>\n<p>Porcelain veneers require minimal enamel (outer layer of a tooth) removal. The dentist can perform this treatment without oral surgery. That means your dentist won\u2019t be opening your teeth, nor will they be treating your tooth\u2019s inner nerves as in other smile correction procedures. The typical procedure will start with a slight modification of your teeth to place veneers. You may receive an anesthetic to enjoy a comfortable experience. Most patients experience little discomfort and sensitivity during the recovery period. But that would only be temporary and can be easily managed if you follow your dentist\u2019s instructions.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Veneers can fix cracks and chips<\/h3>\n<p>Your dentist can fix several cosmetic issues like cracks and chips through porcelain veneers. In fact, it\u2019s an excellent way to improve your teeth\u2019 outlook. Once you have porcelain veneers, you won\u2019t have to cover your teeth or smile just to hide the imperfections anymore. If you have cracked or chipped teeth, you may visit your dentist to determine whether this treatment is right for you.<\/p>\n<h3>3. They look and feel like your natural teeth<\/h3>\n<p>Another benefit of porcelain veneers is that they look and feel like your natural teeth and are often unnoticeable. Your dentist will custom make porcelain veneers according to your natural teeth. It looks and feels so natural that once you undergo the treatment, your friends won\u2019t be able to tell whether you have had any dental work.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Help boost self-confidence<\/h3>\n<p>Speaking of looking and feeling natural, porcelain veneers are a great way to boost your self-confidence. An imperfect smile can invite embarrassing comments and can even cause decreased relationship prospects. You can have this confidence back with porcelain veneers. Since they look and feel natural and can correct several teeth issues, you will feel great about your new, perfect smile and better about your overall appearance.<\/p>\n<h3>5. No need to worry about tooth discoloration anymore<\/h3>\n<p>Porcelain veneers are less likely to get discolored as compared to natural teeth. By having this treatment, you no longer have to worry about having a yellowish smile. But you should follow a proper oral hygiene regimen in order to maintain the new smile. If you observe good oral hygiene practice, veneers can help keep your bright smile for decades.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Porcelain veneers offer numerous benefits to people with imperfect smiles.
