Some people have been able to do it successfully. Look at\u00a0Justin Bieber. He\u2019s done an amazing job. However, he didn\u2019t go through it easily either. He had some hard times breaking through that image.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The former \u201cPyramid\u201d host said that patience was key in making it happen for himself.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI decided long ago that I wasn\u2019t going to do it with scandals, trickery or promotional campaigns,\u201d he said. \u201cI was going to do it with my music, which is a really difficult way to do it. But it happened. And it took me 10 years. But I wanted the music to speak for itself.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"789\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/donny-osmond-surviving-child-stardom-03.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=789\" alt=\"Donny and Marie Osmond\" \/>Donny and Marie Osmond pictured in 1975.Bettmann Archive    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to break out of that teenybopper career. But thank goodness that through perseverance and a lot of support from my fan base, it happened. But it takes an awful lot of work to be accepted as an adult,\u201d Osmond said.<\/p>\n<p>The \u201cEyes Don\u2019t Lie\u201d singer has sold over 100 million albums throughout his career and is currently doing a solo residency in Las Vegas.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI have gone through so many incarnations,\u201d noted Osmond. \u201cAnd every time one of those incarnations came to an end, you start again. I had to keep reinventing myself. We all start again many times in our lives.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The teen idol hosted the \u201cDonny &amp; Marie\u201d variety show alongside his sister Marie Osmond, now 62, starting in 1976.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"713\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/donny-osmond-surviving-child-stardom-01.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=713\" alt=\"Photo of Donny OSMOND and OSMONDS\" \/>\u201cIt is a curse when you hit it big as a little kid because everyone wants to keep you in that pigeonhole,\u201d Osmond said.Redferns    <\/p>\n<p>However, once the show ended three years later, the \u201cPuppy Love\u201d crooner feared his fans would disappear. Once he hit 21, he was told by the industry that he was a \u201chas-been.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He stated that when he first heard that word, he wasn\u2019t going to accept it. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to accept that. I will fight so hard to be back in the business,\u2019\u201d he said. <\/p>\n<p>Osmond added, \u201cThe truth is, without trying to sound clich\u00e9, I love what I do. I love getting on stage. I love singing and entertaining. To me, yes, it\u2019s a job and I work hard at it, but there\u2019s something about the magic of show business.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s something about that curtain going up, the lights hitting you, the band going and the fans cheering. But I also want to rebuild my way,\u201d the \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d champ said. \u201cPeople will always give you advice on how you should do things, and not all of it is good. That\u2019s why it was so important for me to stick with what I truly believed in.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Donny Osmond has lived his life in front of the camera and spent years trying to avoid the child star curse.
