Players qualify for the supermax by being named to an All-NBA team or winning Defensive Player of the Year in either the most recent season or the two prior seasons, or by winning the league&#8217;s MVP award in any of the past three seasons.<\/p>\n<p><img data-src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2021\/0618\/r869310_608x342_16-9.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2021\/0618\/r869310_608x342_16-9.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Most of the NBA&#8217;s big-name free agents have already agreed to deals, but the offseason moves are still going strong, and we have full coverage here.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Latest free agency and trade news and buzz<br \/>\u2022 Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move<br \/>\u2022 Lowe: Offseason winners and losers<br \/>\u2022 What league insiders say about the offseason<br \/>\u2022 Pelton&#8217;s offseason grades: East | West<\/p>\n<p>Now a four-time All-Star and three-time All-NBA selection, Jokic has become arguably the greatest passing big man in the history of the sport, essentially operating as a point guard for Denver in a 6-foot-11 body.<\/p>\n<p>Jokic, who was born in Sombor, Serbia, was the No. 41 overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft. He came to the league a year later and quickly made himself an essential part of Denver&#8217;s plans before blossoming into an All-Star for the first time in the 2018-19 season.<\/p>\n<p>Jokic&#8217;s ascension to All-Star status the past four seasons has coincided with Denver rocketing up the Western Conference standings and making the postseason four times in a row &#8212; including a trip to the 2020 Western Conference finals inside the NBA&#8217;s bubble at Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida.<\/p>\n<p>Now, Jokic and Denver will head into next season hoping to make it to the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history, presumably with Jamal Murray, who missed last season because of a torn ACL he suffered in the spring of 2021, and Michael Porter Jr., who missed the vast majority of last season after undergoing back surgery, both on the court alongside him again.<\/p>\n<p>With Murray missing each of the past two postseasons, Denver lost in the second round to the Phoenix Suns in 2021, and in the first round to the eventual champion Golden State Warriors this past season.<\/p>\n<p>Denver began reshaping its roster ahead of next season by trading guards Monte Morris and Will Barton to the Washington Wizards earlier this week in exchange for guards Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Ish Smith, with Caldwell-Pope likely to slot into Denver&#8217;s starting lineup as a 3-and-D wing next to Murray in the backcourt.<\/p>\n<p><em>ESPN NBA reporter Tim Bontemps contributed to this report.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Denver Nuggets star Nikola Jokic has agreed to the largest contract in NBA history &#8212; a five-year, $270 million supermax extension, his agents, Jeff Schwartz and Mike Lindeman of Excel Sports, told ESPN on Friday.Jokic, the two-time reigning Most Valuable Player, is now secured to the Nuggets for a total of six seasons for $303&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":4199,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[13],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4198"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4198"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4198\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":7158,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4198\/revisions\/7158"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4198"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4198"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4198"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
