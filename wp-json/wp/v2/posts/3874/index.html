Those fools are still dragging innocent Samantha Jones into their utter disgrace.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In December, \u201cAnd Just Like That\u201d \u2014 which was an obvious disaster from Day 1 \u2014 incredibly proved worse than anybody feared. An astounding feat for something that followed the movie \u201cSex and the City 2,\u201d which made Liza Minnelli perform \u201cSingle Ladies\u201d and features the line of dialogue \u201cAbu Dhabi doo!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>On \u201cAJLT,\u201d Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) fumbles about, trying and failing to be woke while becoming a full-fledged alcoholic. Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) said the word \u201cpodcast\u201d like it was in Cantonese, and Kristin Davis as Charlotte seemingly lost the ability to act.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>And who can forget Che Diaz (Sara Ramirez), television\u2019s most hated character \u2014 for good reason?\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The whole self-indulgent debacle made me madder than Carrie when she was forced to take off her Manolos at Kyra\u2019s baby-welcoming party.

Gone is the sophisticated insider glimpse into the poshest corners of Manhattan \u2014 and in its place is \u201cMeet the Fockers\u201d on the Hudson.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Worst of all, floating around like a phantom limb is the comedy icon that made the original series pop \u2014 Kim Cattrall as sexy power publicist Samantha Jones.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>She\u2019s kept around in pathetic and awkward text-message sequences from her new abode in London. We never see her face, only her missives to Carrie. The unsatisfying workaround felt like a dig at Cattrall, who publicly refused to participate in the sequel. In retrospect, the woman is a certifiable genius.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/90500963.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"The glory days of Samantha, Miranda, Carrie and Charlotte are over \u2014 Samantha must be killed. \" \/>The glory days of Samantha, Miranda, Carrie and Charlotte are over \u2014 Samantha must be killed.

Maybe Smith Jerrod, the Absolut Hunk, murdered her and a buzzy trial ensued. She could take a spin on Mr. Big\u2019s Peloton. Whatever.<\/p>\n<p>However, Samantha simply cannot continue to be associated with this heinous show, the main function of which is to be mocked at gay bars. <\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s create a Change.org petition and make HBO send Samantha Jones six feet under. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>HBO is Jonesing for a takedown.
