Well, this \u2018Hana Kuma\u2019 name means something different in Swahili. I won\u2019t say it,\u201d Ugandan journalist Daniel Kibet tweeted. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cDid they do a global search on what the name means?\u201d another asked. \u201cShe should have been well advised [that] it has a very vulgar meaning in Swahili which is spoken by many people.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/06\/Naomi-Osaka-lebron-44.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Osaka excitedly announced her new business venture earlier this week.

Lots of money but that brand won\u2019t fly in Africa. Let it stay in America and Japan. It\u2019s offensive. Do you even have a clue what it means? Get rid of your ego and change the name. God forgive your ignorance.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Another also urged Osaka to consider a name change, stating: \u201cIf you keep the name #hanakuma, the name will override the news and the stories you wish to share. The name of the brand is already news! I suggest a change and also, just being a bit respectful to global culture. It\u2019s not overthinking here, it\u2019s protecting a brand!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Others invariably described the name as \u201cunethical\u201d and \u201cexplicit.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Swahili is estimated to be spoken by approximately 200\u00a0million around the world, with a majority of speakers concentrated in East Africa. Osaka hasn\u2019t yet responded to the controversy, but she shared a cryptic tweet Wednesday night, writing: \u201cPrayers for all my overthinkers. We be going through it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Osaka told the Times that she hopes Hana Kuma will become a top Hollywood media company that produces\u00a0TV shows, documentaries and branded content.
