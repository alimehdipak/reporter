The purpose is to lighten the teeth to their natural shade or even lighter than their natural shade. Pending the severity of the discoloration, the process can take 1 to 3 visits and requires the care of a dentist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although you can do a teeth whitening treatment at home, it\u2019s recommended to do so under the care of a dentist.

Traditional teeth whitening is the process in which surface stains and stubborn plaque are removed from the teeth to lighten the teeth to their natural shade.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, some people will also engage in bleach whitening which is a more extreme version of teeth whitening. This process uses bleach to remove surface stains and set-in stains to lighten the teeth to a shade that is higher than their natural color.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typically, you can use traditional teeth whitening on select teeth since you\u2019re only whitening them to their natural shade. However, with bleach whitening, you should do the entire mouth to keep them all at one consistent shade.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who conducts a teeth whitening procedure?<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teeth whitening is performed by a dentist in a dentist&#8217;s office.
