With a nod to the series Western motif, the Abbott Ranch abuts the Tillerson Ranch and the two families, natch, don\u2019t get along too well. The antagonism factor is ramped up when crusty Wayne Tillerson (Will Patton) locks horns with Royal in a land dispute that gets ugly.<\/p>\n<p>Royal\u2019s got bigger headaches; after hearing a strange noise that spooked his cattle, he rides out into one of his pastures and discovers a huge, perfectly shaped, seemingly bottomless hole with weird, smoke-like particles floating around inside. And \u2026 here\u2019s the sci-fi angle \u2026 suddenly weird stuff starts to happen. A strange, free-spirited self-described \u201cpoet\u201d Autum Rivers (Poots), who seems to know Royal (he has no idea who she is), materializes at the ranch and asks to camp out on its western pasture. She\u2019s got an agenda, natch. Royal\u2019s oldest son, Perry (Tom Pelphrey) \u2014 whose wife Rebecca vanished nine months earlier, leaving him to raise their preteen daughter with help from his parents \u2014 gets into a brutal bar fight with Wayne\u2019s son, Trevor Tillerson, and kills him. That darned mysterious hole, which appears to be some kind of time portal, comes in handy, while interim sheriff Joy Hawk (Tamara Podemski) starts snooping around about Trevor \u2014 and Royal learns firsthand that he does not have a handle on his own reality. Or something.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/OuterRange1-1.jpg?w=1024\" \/>Lily Taylor, Josh Brolin and Tom Pelphrey in a scene from \u201cOuter Range\u201d on Prime Video.Richard Foreman\/Amazon Prime Vid    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cOuter Range\u201d certainly has an interesting premise and it\u2019s a novel conceit to marry a neo-Western premise (think \u201cYellowstone\u201d) with science fiction. The series, which premiered April 15, takes a while to get going through no fault of its cast, particularly Brolin, who\u2019s 54 but whose weathered mien suggests someone much older (he\u2019s also an executive producer with Brad Pitt and others). He\u2019s got that stoic attitude you would expect from someone like Royal Abbott \u2014 so stoic that he often appears curiously unfazed by his up-close-and-personal brushes with that huge hole on his land.<\/p>\n<p>There are several subplots thrown into the mix. Royal\u2019s younger son, Rhett (Lewis Pullman),  is a pretty good rodeo bronco buster who\u2019s implicated in Trevor\u2019s murder while romancing his high school sweetheart, Maria (Isabel Arraiza) \u2014 back in town and working as a bank teller after burning out at college. And you\u2019ll eventually meet Wayne\u2019s estranged wife, Patricia (Deirdre O\u2019Connell).<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/OuterRange4-copy.jpg?w=1024\" \/>Lewis Pullman and Isabel Arraiza as Rhett and Maria in \u201cOuter Range.\u201dRichard Foreman\/Amazon Prime Vid    <\/p>\n<p>The always reliable Taylor does a nice job as Royal\u2019s God-fearing wife who bends the rules \u2014 you\u2019ll learn more about her in later episodes \u2014 and keep an eye out for Noah Reid, who played Patrick, David\u2019s husband and business partner, on \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek.\u201d He\u2019s cast here as Wayne\u2019s youngest son, kindhearted Billy Tillerson, who likes to sing and who\u2019s got a lot going on beneath his placid demeanor.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOuter Range\u201d a bit touch-and-go in terms of its interest factor but, then again, you\u2019ll want to know how it all turns out, thanks to the sci-fi twist that saves it from mediocrity.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Prime Video\u2019s \u201cOuter Range\u201d takes the Western and sci-fi genres \u2014 both prevalent on television right now \u2014 and melds them together into a mash-up eight-part series headlined by Josh Brolin, Lily&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":2366,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[5],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2365"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/6"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2365"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2365\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2365"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2365"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2365"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
