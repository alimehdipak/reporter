Many payroll reports are confined to a specific time period, such as the first pay period of the month, quarterly pay or total pay for the entire accounting year.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes these reports contain too much information, so you or your accountant may want to customize or limit the information reported. QuickBooks Online gives you this capability, by allowing you to generate reports with only the data you want to be reported.
