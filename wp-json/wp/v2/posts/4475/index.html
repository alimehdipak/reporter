He did everything he could to make sure he made it to the Old Course for the 150th playing of golf&#8217;s oldest major championship.<\/p>\n<p>And once he got to Scotland, he did everything he could to make a solid run. He put in more on-site practice than he did for the other two majors he played &#8211; the Masters and the PGA Championship. He then skipped the U.S. Open just to be sure he was ready for The Open.<\/p>\n<p>His game, though, never responded when it counted. Woods followed his opening-round 78 with a ** to miss the cut.<\/p>\n<p>Here is how his second round went down:<\/p>\n<h2>No. 1: Par 4, 375 yards<\/h2>\n<p>The first hole at St. Andrews is much easier when the opening tee shot doesn&#8217;t land in a fresh divot. Woods&#8217; tee ball on Thursday found a divot, his second went in the burn and he walked off a dreadful double-bogey. No divot on Friday, and things went much smoother. A safe approach to the green and better speed with the putter led to an uneventful par.<\/p>\n<p>Score: Par<\/p>\n<p>Total for the day: Even<\/p>\n<p>Total for the tournament: 6 over<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/i\/mlb\/infographics\/greyline.png\" width=\"100%\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>No. 2: Par 4, 452 yards<\/h2>\n<p>Woods, walking with his hands in his pockets and shoulders tense, appears to be cold on a chilly morning in Scotland. Early in his round, though, his swing seems free. A solid drive and a controlled iron approach gave him a good chance at birdie. But the 20-footer lipped out. Some of those &#8212; a lot of those &#8212; are going to have to go in if Woods is to make the cut.<\/p>\n<p>Score: Par<\/p>\n<p>Total for the day: Even<\/p>\n<p>Total for the tournament: 6 over<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/i\/mlb\/infographics\/greyline.png\" width=\"100%\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>No. 3: Par 4, 398 yards<\/h2>\n<p>Although he had just 101 yards in for his second shot, Woods was not messing around with a front-left, tucked pin at third. He played away from the hole and faced a 25-footer for birdie. The putter, which caused him all kinds of problems on Thursday, is working so far on Friday. He made the putt to get into red numbers for the day.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>Tiger has finally got one to drop\ufe0f#The150thOpen pic.twitter.com\/4PyYIo7Ovs<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 The Open (@TheOpen) July 15, 2022<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Score: Birdie<\/p>\n<p>Total for the day: 1 under<\/p>\n<p>Total for the tournament: 5 over<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/i\/mlb\/infographics\/greyline.png\" width=\"100%\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>No. 4: Par 4, 480 yards<\/h2>\n<p>Woods hated his second shot. How do we know? Well, he slammed his club into the ground while the approach was still in the air. It would not be the last time he was upset on the hole. A solid putt from off green left him with a little 3-footer for par. He missed it.<\/p>\n<p>Score: Bogey<\/p>\n<p>Total for the day: Even<\/p>\n<p>Total for the tournament: 6 over<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/i\/mlb\/infographics\/greyline.png\" width=\"100%\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>No. 5: Par 5, 570 yards<\/h2>\n<p>Woods hit a towering 3-wood into the green. The ball settled about 6 feet from the pin. One problem: It was the wrong pin. The fifth is one of the double greens on the Old Course. It is shared with the 13th. So Woods&#8217; ball bounded onto the green and just kept going. When it finally stopped, it was 7 feet from the 13th hole but 117 feet from the fifth. The ridiculously long eagle putt came up 10 feet short. The more manageable birdie just missed on the left side.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>Only at St Andrews&#8230; #The150thOpen pic.twitter.com\/F5Jl1X4hrS<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 The Open (@TheOpen) July 15, 2022<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Score: Par<\/p>\n<p>Total for the day: Even<\/p>\n<p>Total for the tournament: 6 over<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/i\/mlb\/infographics\/greyline.png\" width=\"100%\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>No. 6: Par 4, 414 yards<\/h2>\n<p>Woods has moved around well on his surgically repaired right leg during his time in Scotland. But a grimace and the most pronounced limp of the week came after his wayward tee shot ended up in one of the many fairway bunkers. He had no chance to reach the green and simply pitched out. By the time it was all over, he put another bogey on the scorecard.<\/p>\n<p>Score: Bogey<\/p>\n<p>Total for the day: 1 over<\/p>\n<p>Total for the tournament: 7 over<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/i\/mlb\/infographics\/greyline.png\" width=\"100%\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>No. 7: Par 4, 371 yards<\/h2>\n<p>Woods got rid of the jacket, with the spitting rain subsiding after a dreary early morning. His game, though, did not brighten. He had just 97 yards left for his second shot but hit the wedge on the wrong side of the slope to leave a longer-than-he-wanted birdie putt.<\/p>\n<p>Score: Par<\/p>\n<p>Total for the day: 1 over<\/p>\n<p>Total for the tournament: 7 over<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/i\/mlb\/infographics\/greyline.png\" width=\"100%\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>No. 8: Par 3, 187 yards<\/h2>\n<p>For perhaps the first time all round, Woods played a routine, boring hole.

Woods&#8217; drive settled just short and right of the green. Then the problem that has plagued him over the first 27 holes of this major championship appeared again. Woods has had trouble judging the speed when he has putted or played pitch shots from around the green. His effort at the ninth came up woefully short. Instead of a makeable birdie putt, he had another 25-footer &#8212; which he missed.<\/p>\n<p>Score: Par<\/p>\n<p>Total for the day: 1 over<\/p>\n<p>Total for the tournament: 7 over<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/i\/mlb\/infographics\/greyline.png\" width=\"100%\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>No. 10: Par 4, 386 yards<\/h2>\n<p>Woods started what will likely be his last nine holes of competitive golf for a while with a routine par.

He seemed content aiming for the center of the green. Well, he went flag-hunting at the 11th. But the tee shot fell short and tumbled into the big pot bunker. Woods, though, blasted it out to 12 feet and made the putt for an improbable par.<\/p>\n<p>Score: Par<\/p>\n<p>Total for the day: 1 over<\/p>\n<p>Total for the tournament: 7 over<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/i\/mlb\/infographics\/greyline.png\" width=\"100%\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>No. 13: Par 4, 465 yards<\/h2>\n<p>Woods just cannot figure out the green speeds. His second shot into the green took a huge bounce, leaving him with a 40-footer for birdie. Once again, he left the putt way, way short. He made the 6-footer for par, but it was, again, a lot more work than it needed to be.<\/p>\n<p>Score: Par<\/p>\n<p>Total for the day: 1 over<\/p>\n<p>Total for the tournament: 7 over<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/i\/mlb\/infographics\/greyline.png\" width=\"100%\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>No. 14: Par 5, 614 yards<\/h2>\n<p>Normally, Woods would have probably felt good about a 370-yard drive, even if it ended up in the hay next to the fairway. That is, until he compared it to what he did the day before, when he pummeled one 412 yards. On Friday, his second shot found another of St. Andrews&#8217; famous bunkers. He turned that 412-yard drive on Thursday into a birdie. He could not do the same with the 370-yard blast on Friday.<\/p>\n<p>Score: Par<\/p>\n<p>Total for the day: 1 over<\/p>\n<p>Total for the tournament: 7 over<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/i\/mlb\/infographics\/greyline.png\" width=\"100%\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>No. 15: Par 4, 455 yards<\/h2>\n<p>Another hole, another long birdie putt. This one came after Woods skipped a short wedge approach well past the hole.

Woods&#8217; mishit iron into the 16th green missed the green, but didn&#8217;t go in a bunker. The bad news? His chip shot did.

But Woods soaked in the walk across Swilcan Bridge and up the final fairway. He wiped away tears as he tipped his cap and waved to the adoring crowd lining the Old Course. And he gave them something to cheer about with a perfect little, only-on-links-golf chip with a 4-iron to short range. But, in keeping with how his week went, he missed the birdie putt.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p>All the feels watching Tiger Woods walking up No. 18 at St. Andrews  <\/p>\n<p>(via @TheOpen) pic.twitter.com\/F7f5leoamn<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 ESPN (@espn) July 15, 2022<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Score: Par<\/p>\n<p>Total for the day: 3-over 75<\/p>\n<p>Total for the tournament: 9 over<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tiger Woods spent months thinking about The Open at St. Andrews.
