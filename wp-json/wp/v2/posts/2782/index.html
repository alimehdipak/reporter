And I said, \u2018We should do an episode like that.\u2019 And then, in [author Audrey Niffenegger\u2019s] next book, she had a character watching \u2018The Girl in the Fireplace\u2019 on television. So, I knew she was onto me. And thereafter, we got in touch.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Premiering May 15 (at 9 p.m.),  the six-episode series stars Theo James as Henry de Tamble, a man with a genetic disorder that causes him to time travel and unable to control when or where he lands \u2013 and he\u2019s always traveling naked, which causes problems when he\u2019s unceremoniously dropped into random public locations. Clare Abshire (Rose Leslie, \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d) his wife, has grown up knowing Henry since he time-traveled to visit her throughout her youth. When they meet when they\u2019re both in their 20s, she\u2019s thrilled to see him, but he doesn\u2019t know who she is \u2014 since their visits are still in his future (even though they\u2019re in her past.)<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/rose-leslie.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Rose Leslie leans against a rock looking sad. \" \/>Rose Leslie as Clare in \u201cThe Time Traveler\u2019s Wife.\u201d Macall Polay    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat led me to\u00a0fall in love with the book was its handling of the love story of Henry and Clare,\u201d said Moffat. \u201cBecause Audrey does something very unusual. She takes the story of an absolutely happy marriage. Most love stories end at the altar, and we join them again when there\u2019s a divorce, or an affair, or one of them dies. We don\u2019t do the middle, where two people are perfectly happy with each other for decades. It\u2019s a sort of ongoing miracle around us, and we don\u2019t know how to write about it, because it just sounds sentimental and undramatic. And I think by using time travel, Audrey does a thing that allows you to remember on every page that love is inextricably linked to loss.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Time Traveler\u2019s Wife\u201d was also a 2009 movie starring Rachel McAdams as Clare and Eric Bana as Henry.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/time-travelers-wife-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams stroll down a street smiling. \" \/>Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams in \u201cThe Time Traveler\u2019s Wife\u201d movie. \u00a9New Line Cinema\/courtesy Evere    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt the time that film came out, I wouldn\u2019t have had the profile to be the one that got to adapt it, frankly,\u201d said Moffat. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t expect it. I never gave it a thought, except when I was nabbing ideas for \u2018Doctor Who.\u2019 On the very last day that I worked on \u2018Doctor Who,\u2019 I went for a drink with my executive producer, and he said, \u2018I\u2019ve been looking into the rights for \u2018The time Traveler\u2019s Wife.\u2019\u201d So, it wasn\u2019t a case of me hanging around for a decade wondering when my turn would come. But, when it came up, I was keen.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/theo-james.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Theo James sits on a rock with a young girl. \" \/>Henry (The James) during one of his visits with Clare when she\u2019s a child in \u201cThe Time Traveler\u2019s Wife.\u201d Macall Polay    <\/p>\n<p>In the story, Henry and Clare spend a lot of time together when she\u2019s a child and he\u2019s an adult, which might raise some eyebrows in the audience.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere will be people \u2013 and there have always have been people \u2013 who distort the intent of the book in order to pretend they\u2019re outraged by it,\u201d said Moffat. \u201cIf I look at a photograph of my wife as a child, I know that adorable little girl, and I love her because I love that human being \u2026 But there\u2019s no sexual feeling to it, because that\u2019s not a sexual being. Love is a bigger thing than sex. We shouldn\u2019t be looking at everything through the prism of desire and sex. So, I think it\u2019s a fake controversy. It\u2019s not real. It\u2019s people wanting to be outraged. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI challenge anyone to find anything in the book, film, or TV show that suggests that [Henry] behaves in anything other than an absolutely appropriate way.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Steven Moffat (\u201cDoctor Who,\u201d \u201cSherlock\u201d) adapted \u201cThe Time Traveler\u2019s Wife\u201d into an HBO series because he\u2019s a fan of the book. \u201cIt inspired the [\u2018Doctor Who\u2019] episode \u2018The Girl in the Fireplace,\u2019\u201d&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":2783,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[5],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2782"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/6"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2782"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2782\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2782"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2782"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2782"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
