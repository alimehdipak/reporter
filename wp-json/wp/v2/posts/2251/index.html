Then, organs develop and hopefully function properly. Those specific &#8220;regulatory&#8221; proteins are called transcription factors, and they do their thing by binding to specific DNA sequences at just the right time.<\/p>\n<p>Scientists have known that mutations to three cardiac transcription factors &#8212; GATA4, NKX2-5 and TBX5 &#8212; lead to a range of congenital heart disease states. Researchers have thought that an inability of these mutated genes to &#8220;turn on&#8221; cardiac genes is what led to heart disease.<\/p>\n<p>Now, the lab of Frank Conlon, PhD, professor of biology and genetics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, discovered there&#8217;s more to the story. It involves non-cardiac genes, as well as answering a question researchers have struggled with for years.<\/p>\n<p>Aside from the aforementioned transcription factors, past research showed that a protein complex subunit called CHD4 seems to play a major role in congenital heart disease. Deleting it causes embryonic death in animal models. Mutations to it cause major problems with proteins involved in skeletal and muscle development.<\/p>\n<p>Turns out, CHD4 is essential for numerous developmental events, such as ensuring proper timing of the switch from stem cell lineages to differentiated cell types &#8212; that is, the moment when stem cells turn into, say, heart cells or leg muscle cells. CDH4 also is essential for maintaining cell differentiation &#8212; keeping heart cells healthy heart cells. And CDH4 is a player in activating cellular processes to deal with DNA damage.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, CHD4 cannot bind DNA. It needs to be brought to a specific location, or genetic loci, of a cardiac gene to do its things. So, scientists could not answer the key question of how CHD4 played its role in cardiac disease.<\/p>\n<p>Conlon&#8217;s lab, in collaboration with colleagues at UNC-Chapel Hill, Princeton, and Boston Children&#8217;s Hospital, shows that GATA4, NKX2-5 and TBX5 interact with CHD4 inside the embryonic heart, recruiting it for action, and that&#8217;s how CHD4 plays its role in heart health and disease.<\/p>\n<p>These findings, published in the journal <em>Genes &amp; Development<\/em>, imply that heart disease states are not only due to loss of cardiac gene expression, but that these genes&#8217; recruitment of CHD4 can lead to a misexpression of non-cardiac genes, leading in the end to faulty heart development.<\/p>\n<p>To put this implication to the test, Conlon and his collaborators removed the binding site for Nkx2-5 in the skeletal muscle gene Acta1 in mice and, independently, the GATA4 binding site in the smooth muscle gene Myh11.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In both instances, the mutation led to the inappropriate expression of the non-cardiac genes in the heart in a dominant manner,&#8221; said Conlon, a member of the UNC McAllister Heart Institute. &#8220;This provides a mechanism for the prevalence of congenital heart disease in humans with just one mutated copy of Nkx2-5, Gata4 or Tbx5.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><em>Other authors include, co-first authors Zachary L.
