Now, of course, people are on the bandwagon.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For decades, the modeling world was defined by glamorous exclusivity: impossibly thin models in designer duds, consuming designer drugs, booze and cigarettes. They were seen and certainly not heard. <\/p>\n<p>In the new issue of British Vogue, Gisele B\u00fcndchen opened up about her early career and diet of wine and cancer sticks.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/booze-drugs-90s-models.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"The hard partying 90s fashion model is a thing of the past.\" \/>The hard partying 90s fashion model is a thing of the past.

Getty Images for Sports Illustra    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cFrom the outside, it looked like I had everything and I was just 22 years old. On the inside, I felt as if I\u2019d hit rock bottom.\u00a0I was starting my day with a mocha Frappuccino with whipped cream and three cigarettes, then drinking a bottle of wine every night. Imagine what that was doing to my mind.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And in 2013, former Vogue Australia editor Kirstie Clements wrote a tell-all with stories of starving models, most notably that catwalkers were eating paper towels to be thin. Kate Moss\u2019 2005 cocaine scandal ruled headlines for weeks and Naomi Campbell has spoken out about beating her addiction to coke and booze. <\/p>\n<p>B\u00fcndchen, of course, cleaned up her act to eventually become \u2014 along with Tom Brady \u2014 one half of the world\u2019s most insanely disciplined wellness couples. She saw a naturopath who suggested she remove sugar, grains, dairy, caffeine, alcohol and cigarettes from her diet. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/Gisele-Bu\u0308ndchen-04.jpg?w=682\" alt=\"Gisele Bundchen\" \/>In the new issue of British Vogue, Gisele B\u00fcndchen opened up about her early career and diet of wine and cancer sticks.Gisele Bundchen Instagram    <\/p>\n<p>Current model of the moment Bella Hadid told In Style in January she is now sober. \u201cI loved alcohol and it got to the point where I even started canceling nights that I felt I wouldn\u2019t be able to control myself,\u201d the 25-year-old said, adding that she was dealing with booze-fueled 3 a.m. anxiety attacks.<\/p>\n<p>Health, not hard-partying, is now the norm. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere was a time when heroin chic was part of the business,\u201d said Lawrence. \u201cMy first agency, we represented Jaime King, who was very forthcoming about her drug problem. And back then it was glorified.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>He added: \u201cYears ago, you\u2019d see models partying, not adhering\u00a0to a healthy lifestyle. Now you see models\u00a0all into yoga, fitness and healthy eating.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"827\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/lucie-beatrix.jpg?w=827\" alt=\"Former model turned competitive runner Lucie Beatrix turned said she learned how to subsist on cigarettes and wine in model apartments.\" \/>Former model turned competitive runner Lucie Beatrix turned said she learned how to subsist on cigarettes and wine in model apartments.Shervin Shaikh    <\/p>\n<p>Lucie Beatrix, 33, is one of the former. While living in NYC model apartments, the St. Louis native, who modeled for a decade, survived on cigarettes and a bottle of wine for dinner, so that she could easily pass out.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI learned from my roommates,\u201d said Beatrix, who has graced the cover of Elle Mexico, among others. \u201cThe skinnier I was, the more money I made. It was applauded.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But social media and social justice have changed our society. The once discerning industry has put out a welcome mat to many sizes and ethnicities, and encouraged models to speak out on their pet issues. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/kate-moss-08.jpg?w=682\" alt=\"Models Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss attend the De Beers\/Versace 'Diamonds are Forever' celebration at Syon House on June 09, 1999 in London. \" \/>Kate Moss embodied the concept of heroin chic.

Evans Ward\/BEI\/Shutterstock    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI remember when I was getting out of the industry, I was excited to see the body positivity stuff. I was glad to see bigger girls being embraced instead of scolded,\u201d said Beatrix, who is now sober and a competitive runner.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like going to a fast-food restaurant. In the beginning, you only had the burger. Then they added a turkey burger. Now they have a burger, a veggie, a turkey and an impossible burger. That is the way of the industry. There will always be the client that wants the size two or size four, but what we are seeing is you can\u2019t just cater to one thing,\u201d said Lawrence.<\/p>\n<p>The agent has seen the changing nature of the curve industry, noting when Ashley Graham was at his agency, she was not an overnight success. \u201cIt took a while,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember Victoria\u2019s Secret saying they would not use curve models because VS is about aspiration. Personally, I think millions of girls that might not have thought of themselves as models and presto, those\u00a0doors are open. Ten years ago, Yumi Nu might not be considered.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/carla-bruni.jpg?w=682\" alt=\"Former first lady of France Carla Bruni smoking a cigarette  and swilling a drink in 1992.\" \/>Former first lady of France Carla Bruni smoking a cigarette and swilling a drink in 1992.

The influencers have become what the actors were in the \u201990s when magazines started replacing models with actors,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>And brands are no longer all about blue-eyed blondes. <\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/kim-kardashian-05.jpg?w=682\" alt=\"Curvy influencer Kim Kardashian landed the cover of SI Swim.\" \/>Curvy influencer Kim Kardashian landed the cover of SI Swim.    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI have friends in the business all around the world and everyone wants the ethnically ambiguous girl. It used to be about a girl who looked like Christie Brinkley. That message [of ethnic ambiguity] is amplified louder than ever.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Beatrix noted that models are encouraged to be open about their issues \u2014 even scoring points and magazine covers or campaigns for their radical transparency. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I lost weight to hold up my end of the contract, I got extremely skinny, and it was applauded left and right. When I came out and said I had a problem, everyone around me told me not to talk about it.
