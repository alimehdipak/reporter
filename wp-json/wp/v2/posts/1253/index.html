As hosts, they avoided going through qualifying, though they did play a string of high-profile friendlies and even entered the 2021 Gold Cup as an invitational team, losing in the semifinal to the United States.<\/p>\n<p>On paper, the Dutch, Senegal and Ecuador look a notch above them. The Netherlands appear somewhat revitalized after Louis van Gaal&#8217;s return, Senegal are the reigning African champions (and boast Liverpool&#8217;s Sadio Mane in attack) and Ecuador were third for most of the grueling CONMEBOL qualifying tournament before dropping off at the end.<\/p>\n<p><b>Must-see match: Netherlands vs. Senegal<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Senegal are deep and gifted in every department, from Edouard Mendy in goal to Kalidou Koulibaly at the back and Mane up front. They have plenty of big-game experience too, coming through shootout wins against Egypt in both the African Cup of Nations final and the CAF World Cup playoff. They won&#8217;t be rattled by the pedigree of the Dutch and this should be an open affair.<\/p>\n<p><b>X factor: Will home-field advantage matter?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>OK, you don&#8217;t expect wild and noisy support from the Qataris at their game simply because, well, we&#8217;ve never seen it before, whether it&#8217;s Asian qualifying or glamour friendlies.

They reached the semifinals of the 2018 World Cup and the final of the last European championship; if anything, they went out with a sense that they could have done more because in terms of talent, they certainly weren&#8217;t inferior to the sides that beat them. Has Gareth Southgate learned from past mistakes? The sense is that he has.<\/p>\n<p>Behind England, things should be extremely tight. The United States have plenty of stars based in top European teams, from Chelsea to Borussia Dortmund, but for different reasons, the likes of Christian Pulisic and Gio Reyna aren&#8217;t always difference-makers at club level. They&#8217;ll need to be in Qatar.<\/p>\n<p>Iran sailed through Asian qualifying, losing just one game, but on paper don&#8217;t look as strong as previous editions.

They&#8217;ll be very happy with this group, in any case.<\/p>\n<p>Mexico are likely to battle it out with Poland for second place. <em>El Tri<\/em> blew hot and cold in qualifying while Poland, having changed coaches before the playoffs, are in some ways still finding themselves. Robert Lewandowski will get you out of jams, but only if you can get him the ball in dangerous areas and that&#8217;s not always a given. The Saudis won their Asian qualifying group, beating out Australia and Japan, but they were disappointing at the Asian Cup and look a notch below the rest of the group.<\/p>\n<p><b>Must-see match: Mexico vs. Poland<\/b><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the opening game of this group, and it could be an early decider in terms of who finishes behind Argentina.  There&#8217;s a ton of pressure on coach Gerardo &#8220;Tata&#8221; Martino, but on the other hand, Mexican supporters tend to travel in large quantities, which could give this the feel of a &#8220;home&#8221; game. Poland overcame Sweden in a tense playoff final to qualify, but there&#8217;s a sense they have yet to get their best out of their stars, Lewandowski and Piotr Zielinski.<\/p>\n<p><b>X factor: Lionel Messi<\/b><\/p>\n<p>There are so many layers to his World Cup experience. Argentina have bounced back from the Jorge Sampaoli-led chaos we saw in Russia and, perhaps most intriguingly, they&#8217;ve done it without piling excessive pressure on Messi.

Either way, he&#8217;s in the driver&#8217;s seat.<\/p>\n<p>The rest of the group is actually quite tight. Tunisia won&#8217;t win points for style and are nowhere near as talented as they&#8217;ve been in the past, but they&#8217;ve proven to be difficult to play against and cagey &#8212; a script that served them well throughout qualifying.

But Spain and Germany are two European heavyweights, and it&#8217;s tough to see either of them slipping up in this group.<\/p>\n<p>Germany will be determined to make up for the embarrassment of a group-stage exit as holders four years ago and Spain are a resurgent force under Luis Enrique after a second-round exit against hosts Russia in 2018. The key issue in this group is likely to come down to which team finishes top.

But although both teams are still stocked with world-class talent &#8212; Kevin De Bruyne, Eden Hazard, Romelu Lukaku for Belgium, Luka Modric and Ivan Perisic for Croatia &#8212; they are also two of the oldest squads in Qatar and they could be vulnerable to an upset against Morocco and Canada.<\/p>\n<p>Belgium and Croatia are favourites to qualify, but Canada are a young and ambitious team under coach John Herdman and will be desperate to impress in Qatar before co-hosting the 2026 World Cup with the USA and Mexico. Morocco are a squad full of top-level experience in Europe, most notably Paris Saint-Germain full-back Achraf Hakimi; captain Romain Saiss, the Wolves defender; and Sevilla forward Youssef En-Nesyri.<\/p>\n<p><b>Must-see match: Croatia vs. Canada<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The meeting between Croatia and Canada on Nov. 27 could be the decisive fixture in the group.
