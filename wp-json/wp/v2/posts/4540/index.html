And if somebody doesn\u2019t because they have a disability, they will know another reference point.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Use website content for deep dives<\/h3>\n<p>Thomas has noticed that dedicated fragrance enthusiasts engage with his blog posts more than his social media content. They are \u201clooking for more detail,\u201c he says, which also allows him to be \u201ca little more science-y, a little more niche. Whereas Instagram fans can be a lot more fickle.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>His blog posts also provide more space for a detailed narrative that encourages discovery. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to try to convince someone that they may like a perfume, or they may not like it \u2014 it\u2019s all a journey for them,\u201d he notes. \u201cI love when I write something and someone goes, \u2018Wow, I bought that.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Build relationships<\/h3>\n<p>Early on, Thomas cultivated connections with PR reps to get perfume samples to write about. Building up industry contacts helped pave the way for his writing and consultancy gigs. Meanwhile, those jobs also help with cross-pollinating story ideas for the blog, whether it\u2019s interviewing an up-and-coming perfumer or including an undiscovered fragrance in a themed roundup.<\/p>\n<p>But, he notes, it\u2019s also important to him to be ethical while juggling all of these jobs. At Olfaction, he helped create a line of candles, which forced him to make a business decision. \u201cNow I wouldn\u2019t write about candles at all,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t feel it\u2019s right for me to comment on someone else\u2019s product if I am a market competitor.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Trust your inclinations \u2014 and embrace the freedom<\/h3>\n<p>Thomas says his strategy is to focus more on what he intuits is the right thing for him, including what he chooses to write about and embracing his occasionally whimsical style. \u201cPeople just like the way that I write,\u201d he says. \u201cThey like that I can be fun and do silly things like write about <a href=\"https:\/\/thecandyperfumeboy.com\/2012\/03\/05\/its-time-to-scent-the-muppets-on-the-candy-perfume-boy-tonight\/\">what perfume would Miss Piggy wear?<\/a>\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While he does pay attention to what\u2019s happening in the industry and on other blogs, he relies on his brand and his intuition to guide his choices about what to cover. \u201cThat sort of insulates you from mindlessly following these trends,\u201d he notes, which is crucial to avoid \u201cchasing after something rather than creating your own thing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Not running after clicks allows him to \u201ctell the stories that people aren\u2019t thinking they want to hear,\u201d he says, and it also provides the variety he needs to stay engaged \u2014 and the credibility that draws readers in. \u201cThat\u2019s what being a creator allows you to do, isn&#8217;t it? The world&#8217;s your oyster, you can just do what you want. The exciting part is the fact that it&#8217;s just so open and free.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/services.google.com\/fb\/forms\/gfcoptin\/\"><i>Sign up for our monthly newsletter<\/i><\/a><i> to get the latest from Google for Creators in your inbox.<\/i><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Write in an accessible way Perfume is mysterious and sometimes intimidating, so it was important for Thomas to write about it in a down-to-earth, relatable manner to reach a larger audience. \u201cI&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":4541,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[15],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4540"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4540"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4540\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":7823,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4540\/revisions\/7823"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4540"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4540"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4540"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
