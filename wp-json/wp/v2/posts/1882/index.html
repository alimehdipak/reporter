Additional concerns and structural requirements to consider include fire exits, room sizes, utility connections, security, privacy, and soundproof rooms.<\/p>\n<h3>Office Buildings<\/h3>\n<p>The scope of office buildings can range from small firms to skyscrapers for big corporations. A big building can even merge multiple businesses within its massive framework.
