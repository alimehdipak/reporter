To promote healthy indoor air quality that\u2019s safe to breathe and to extend the life of your humidifier, always use demineralized, distilled, or purified water in your humidifier.<\/p>\n<h3>Is it necessary to use distilled water in a humidifier?<\/h3>\n<p>You don\u2019t have to use distilled water in your humidifier, but you may be able to avoid white powder residue from forming, and delay bacteria and mold growth in your humidifier\u2019s tank by using distilled water instead of tap water.<\/p>\n<p>What can I use instead of distilled water in humidifier?<\/p>\n<p>Reverse osmosis water can also be used safely in humidifiers. Reverse osmosis (RO) is 98% free of dissolved impurities. The difference between distilled and RO water is the process. RO water is purified using intense filtration.<\/p>\n<p>What can I use instead of distilled water?<\/p>\n<p>Filtered water is one solution. Filtered water starts out as plain tap water. You may already have filtered water in your home by way of a whole-house filtration system, a faucet filter or a water filtration pitcher (you can even get a filtered water bottle).<\/p>\n<p>Is it bad to use tap water in humidifier?<\/p>\n<p>Using tap water is fine for most humidifiers. Water does not need to be distilled or purified for it to be safely dispersed into the air in the form of water vapor. You can opt to use distilled water if you notice white mineral dust forming in your humidifier.<\/p>\n<h3>Is boiled water distilled water?<\/h3>\n<p>No, they aren\u2019t the same. Boiled water is simply water that has had the temperature increased until it reaches its boiling point. This kills a host of bacteria that can make a person sick. Distilled water is water that has been stripped of all impurities, including minerals and microorganisms.<\/p>\n<p>Is it OK to sleep with a humidifier every night?<\/p>\n<p>Apart from the health benefits in the summer and winter, some people find that they simply sleep better with a humidifier running at night. Why is this? First, because maintaining the optimal humidity level increases your overall comfort when trying to fall asleep. It can help ease an itchy, irritated throat.<\/p>\n<p>Is purified or distilled water better?<\/p>\n<p>Both purified and distilled water are very healthy for you and are essentially the same. The main difference between the two is that purified water doesn\u2019t necessarily get rid of all of the healthy minerals that can be found in water, which isn\u2019t the case with distilled water.<\/p>\n<p>Is spring water distilled?<\/p>\n<p>By leaving the minerals and trace electrolytes in the spring water, you\u2019ll get a crisp, fresh water taste. If you\u2019re asking, \u201cIs spring water distilled?\u201d The answer is no, spring water is not the same as distilled water.<\/p>\n<h3>Can I use bottled water instead of distilled water?<\/h3>\n<p>The biggest difference between bottled water and distilled water is that bottled water is meant for drinking and distilled water is not. This is because of the mineral content of each form of water, which is determined by the way in which these products are filtered or purified.<\/p>\n<p>Is humidifier good for lungs?<\/p>\n<p>Humidifiers, when used correctly, can help maintain the perfect degree of moisture in the air (between 30 \u2013 50%), and especially for individuals with a chronic lung disease, can foster eased breathing, reduced irritation of nasal passages, and the ability to more effectively expel phlegm in coughing.<\/p>\n<p>Can I use Aquafina in my humidifier?<\/p>\n<p>The Truth About Bottled Water and Alkaline water<\/p>\n<p>You should avoid this type of bottled water for your CPAP humidifier. Some brands, such as Aquafina, purify the water to remove impurities and can be used if you don\u2019t have access to distilled water.<\/p>\n<p>What is the difference between distilled and spring water?<\/p>\n<p>WHAT IS SPRING WATER? Unlike distilled water, spring water generally comes from underground sources and no longer passes through municipal sources. As a result, spring water is known for its great and refreshing taste and rarely tastes flat or boiled. Compared to distilled water, it\u2019s a lot \u201cfresher\u201d and \u201ccrisper.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Can I use spring water humidifier?<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re using an ultrasonic humidifier, you may notice more white dust. In an evaporative humidifier, you may see a shorter wick life as these minerals build up in your wick and break it down faster. In both units, you may see a scale develop inside your unit. For these reasons, we don\u2019t recommend using spring water.<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A huge factor in the performance of your humidifier is the quality of the water used.
