But in recent weeks, those without cars or bikes took to blogs and social media to ask why they are getting so few orders.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI used to do 10-15 deliveries a day but the past two days I have received only one assignment on my app,\u201d a walker who did not want to be identified told The Post. \u201cUber Eats delivery walkers are shocked, confused, and left with no explanation from the company as to why walkers are being phased out.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve only made $20 in the last 4 days. Literally no offers coming up,\u201d an UberEats walker posted on Reddit in April. Another added, \u201cI did it evenings when I had nothing to do. Got an email from Uber last week saying I should get a bike \ud83d\ude41 .\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/Uber-Eats-38.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Uber Eats deliveryperson\" \/>Most of the walkers make deliveries within a half-mile radius.Bloomberg via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>Uber insists that UberEats walkers haven\u2019t been marked for extinction.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe have not phased out couriers who deliver on foot,\u201d Uber spokeswoman Freddi Goldstein told The Post in a statement. \u201cWe are simply encouraging couriers to bike when possible to ensure the most reliable delivery times for consumers. In that vein, we are also connecting our couriers to information on discounted bike rentals.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, UberEats walkers complain that not only has the company been cagey, its clampdown has been severe.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAfter a couple days of getting told that my account is fine and it\u2019s probably just an issue with demand,\u201d wrote another walker on Reddit, \u201cI finally talked to a customer service agent who did a little bit of a deeper look, and told me that the walking option is basically being removed from my city. He switched me over to cyclist, and I immediately started getting orders again.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Uber says walkers make up only a small percentage of deliveries in New York City and the other urban markets where the service is active. This weekend, blogger Ethan Bowman reported that the delivery radius for UberEats walkers had shrunk to about 400 meters \u2014 a \u201cridiculously low\u201d figure that\u2019s down from as much as 1,300 meters before the clampdown. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to camp yourself in a 24\/hour restaurant surrounded by apartment buildings just to get any orders,\u201d Bowman wrote on his blog GripRoom. \u201cAt this point, Uber should just remove the walking option because they\u2019re treating the walkers like disposable garbage.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cInstead of facing the heat from laying off thousands of workers, they\u2019re forcing them to quit,\u201d he added. \u201cIn a month or so they\u2019ll be able to shut down the program \u2018due to a lack of interest.\u2019 \u201c<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Uber Eats is quietly slashing the ranks of a little-known segment of its food-delivery workers \u2014 those who deliver orders on foot.
