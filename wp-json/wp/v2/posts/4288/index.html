A dryer fire can result, as well as poor dryer performance, high energy bills, and health risks. The dryer vent collects lint, which can affect the indoor air quality of your home. As a result, you might face the following problems if you don&#8217;t regularly clean your dryer vent:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Carbon Monoxide:<\/strong>Your dryer releases toxic fumes of carbon monoxide, which escape through the vent. But, these poisonous fumes have trouble leaving through the vent if it gets clogged. Consequently, it enters your house, leading to carbon monoxide poisoning.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mold:\u00a0<\/strong>A dryer vent also collects water from wet clothes, which releases vapor. However, a clogged vent will allow the vapor into your house, increasing moisture. When humidity rises, your living space becomes an ideal place for mold to grow. It can grow in areas you won\u2019t be able to see. Thus, you and your loved ones might suffer from allergy symptoms like runny nose, cough, watery eyes, dry skin, respiratory problems, and more.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Air Pollutants:\u00a0<\/strong>Other than mold and carbon monoxide, dryer vents release dust, debris, lint particles, and other pollutants into your house. You might experience respiratory and other health problems due to these irritants and pollutants. In addition, many products contain benzyl alcohol and acetic acid, which are liked with health problems.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) risks can be posed by dryer vents. In certain models of electric and gas clothes dryers, dryer vent emissions can cause serious health problems, including lung cancer, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).<\/p>\n<p>EPA recommends avoiding clothes dryers that emit high levels of pollutants from the dryer vent if you have breathing difficulties or other health concerns. Additionally, people should clean their dryer vents regularly to reduce IAQ risks.
