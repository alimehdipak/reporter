And while Vica Li tells her followers that she \u201ccreated all of these channels on her own,\u201d her Facebook account shows that at least nine people manage her page.<\/p>\n<p>That portfolio of accounts is just one tentacle of China\u2019s rapidly growing influence on US-owned social media platforms, an Associated Press examination has found.<\/p>\n<p>As China continues to assert its economic might, it is using the global social media ecosystem to expand its already formidable influence. The country has quietly built a network of social media personalities who parrot the government\u2019s perspective in posts seen by hundreds of thousands of people, operating in virtual lockstep as they promote China\u2019s virtues, deflect international criticism of its human rights abuses and advance Beijing\u2019s talking points on world affairs like Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/Vica-Li-07.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Vica Li\" width=\"619\" height=\"616\" \/>Vica Li has regularly appeared in broadcasts of CGTN, the Chinese-state run TV network.Instagram\/Vica Li    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/Vica-Li-05.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Vica Li\" \/>Vica Li describes herself as just a \u201clife blogger\u201d and \u201cfood lover.\u201dInstagram\/Vica Li    <\/p>\n<p>Some of China\u2019s state-affiliated reporters have posited themselves as trendy Instagram influencers or bloggers. The country has also hired firms to recruit influencers to deliver carefully crafted messages that boost its image to social media users.<\/p>\n<p>And it is benefitting from a cadre of Westerners who have devoted YouTube channels and Twitter feeds to echoing pro-China narratives on everything from\u00a0Beijing\u2019s treatment of Uyghur Muslims\u00a0to Olympian Eileen Gu,\u00a0an American who competed for China\u00a0in the most recent Winter Games.<\/p>\n<p>The influencer network allows Beijing to easily proffer propaganda to unsuspecting Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and YouTube users around the globe. At least 200 influencers with connections to the Chinese government or its state media are operating in 38 different languages, according to\u00a0research\u00a0from Miburo, a firm that tracks foreign disinformation operations.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou can see how they\u2019re trying to infiltrate every one of these countries,\u201d said Miburo President Clint Watts, a former FBI agent. \u201cIt is just about volume, ultimately. If you just bombard an audience for long enough with the same narratives people will tend to believe them over time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While\u00a0Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine was being broadly condemned\u00a0as a brazen assault on democracy, self-described \u201ctraveler,\u201d \u201cstory-teller\u201d and \u201cjournalist\u201d Li Jingjing took to YouTube to offer a different narrative.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/Li-Jingjing-10.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Li Jingjing\" \/>Li Jingjing is a reporter for CGTN.Instagram\/Li Jingjing    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/Li-Jingjing-08.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Li Jingjing\" \/>Li Jingjing says she wants to show subscribers \u201cthe world through my lens.\u201dInstagram\/Li Jingjing    <\/p>\n<p>She posted a video to her account called \u201cUkraine crisis: The West ignores wars &amp; destructions it brings to Middle East,\u201d in which she mocked US journalists covering the war. She\u2019s also dedicated other videos to amplifying\u00a0Russian propaganda\u00a0about the conflict, including claims of Ukrainian genocide or that the US and NATO provoked Russia\u2019s invasion.<\/p>\n<p>Li Jingjing says in her YouTube profile that she is eager to show her roughly 21,000 subscribers \u201cthe world through my lens.\u201d But what she does not say in her segments on Ukraine, which have tens of thousands of views, is that she is a reporter for CGTN, articulating views that are not just her own but also familiar Chinese government talking points.<\/p>\n<p>Most of China\u2019s influencers use pitches similar to Li Jingjing\u2019s in hopes of attracting audiences around the world, including the US, Egypt and Kenya. The personalities, many of them women, call themselves \u201ctravelers,\u201d sharing photos and videos that promote China as an idyllic destination.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/china-CGTN-19.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"CGTN\" \/>The personalities do not proactively disclose their ties to China\u2019s government and have largely phased out references in their posts to their employers, which include CGTN, China Radio International and Xinhua News Agency.Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey clearly have identified the \u2018Chinese lady influencer\u2019 is the way to go,\u201d Watts said of China.<\/p>\n<p>The AP identified dozens of these accounts, which collectively have amassed more than 10 million followers and subscribers. Many of the profiles belong to Chinese state media reporters who have in recent months transformed their Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube accounts \u2014 platforms that are largely blocked in China \u2014 and begun identifying as \u201cbloggers,\u201d \u201cinfluencers\u201d or non-descript \u201cjournalists.\u201d Nearly all of them were running Facebook ads, targeted to users outside of China, that encourage people to follow their pages.<\/p>\n<p>The personalities do not proactively disclose their ties to China\u2019s government and have largely phased out references in their posts to their employers, which include CGTN, China Radio International and Xinhua News Agency.<\/p>\n<p>Foreign governments have long tried to exploit social media, as well as its ad system, to influence users. During the 2016 US election, for example,\u00a0a Russian internet agency paid in rubles to run more than 3,000 divisive political ads targeting Americans.<\/p>\n<p>In response, tech companies like Facebook and Twitter promised to better alert American users to foreign propaganda by labeling state-backed media accounts.<\/p>\n<p>But the AP found in its review that most of the Chinese influencer social media accounts are inconsistently labeled as state-funded media. The accounts \u2014 like those belonging to Li Jingjing and Vica Li \u2014 are often labeled on Facebook or Instagram, but are not flagged on YouTube or TikTok. Vica Li\u2019s account is not labeled on Twitter. Last month, Twitter began identifying Li Jingjing\u2019s account as Chinese state-media.<\/p>\n<p>Vica Li said in a YouTube video that she is disputing the labels on her Facebook and Instagram accounts. She did not respond to a detailed list of questions from the AP.<\/p>\n<p>Often, followers who are lured in by accounts featuring scenic images of China\u2019s landscape might not be aware that they\u2019ll also encounter state-endorsed propaganda.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/Jessica-Zang-14.jpg?w=819\" alt=\"Jessica Zang\" \/>Jessica Zang, a video blogger for CGTN, rarely mentions her employer to her 1.3 million followers.Instagram\/ Jessica Zang    <\/p>\n<p>Jessica Zang\u2019s picturesque Instagram photos show her smiling beneath a beaming sun, kicking fresh powdered snow atop a ski resort on the Altai Mountains in China\u2019s Xinjiang region during the Beijing Olympics. She describes herself as a video creator and blogger who hopes to present her followers with \u201cbeautiful pics and videos about life in China.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Zang, a video blogger for CGTN, rarely mentions her employer to her 1.3 million followers on Facebook. Facebook and Instagram identify her account as \u201cstate-controlled media\u201d but she is not labeled as such on TikTok, YouTube or on Twitter, where Zang lists herself as a \u201csocial media influencer.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s likely by choice that she doesn\u2019t put any state affiliations, because you put that label on your account, people start asking certain types of questions,\u201d Rui Zhong, who researches technology and the China-US relationship for the Washington-based Wilson Center, said of Zang.<\/p>\n<p>Peppered between tourism photos are posts with more obvious propaganda. One video titled \u201cWhat foreigners in BEIJING think of the CPC and their life in China?\u201d features Zang interviewing foreigners in China who gush about the Chinese Communist Party and insist they\u2019re not surveilled by the government the way outsiders might think.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe really want to let more people \u2026 know what China is really like,\u201d Zang tells viewers.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s an important goal in China, which has\u00a0launched coordinated efforts\u00a0to shape its image abroad and whose president, Xi Jinping, has spoken openly of his desire to have China perceived favorably on the global stage.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, accounts like Zang\u2019s are intended to obscure global criticisms of China, said Jessica Brandt, a Brookings Institution expert on foreign interference and disinformation.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey want to promote a positive vision of China to drown out their human rights records,\u201d Brandt said.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"820\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/Li-Jingjing-09.jpg?w=820\" alt=\"Li Jingjing \" \/>Li Jingjing dedicated other videos to amplifying\u00a0Russian propaganda\u00a0about the conflict.Instagram\/Li Jingjing    <\/p>\n<p>Li Jingjing and Zang did not return messages from the AP seeking comment. CGTN did not respond to repeated interview requests. CGTN America, which is registered as a foreign agent with the Justice Department and has disclosed having commercial arrangements with several international news organizations, including the AP, CNN and Reuters, did not return messages. A lawyer who has represented CGTN America did not respond either.<\/p>\n<p>A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, Liu Pengyu, said in a statement, \u201cChinese media and journalists carry out normal activities independently, and should not be assumed to be led or interfered by the Chinese government.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>China\u2019s interest in the influencer realm became more evident in December after it was revealed that the Chinese Consulate in New York had paid $300,000 for New Jersey firm Vippi Media to recruit influencers to post messages to Instagram and TikTok followers during the Beijing Olympics, including content that would highlight China\u2019s work on climate change.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s unclear what the public saw from that campaign, and if the social media posts were properly labeled as paid advertisements by the Chinese Consulate, as Instagram and TikTok require. Vippi Media has not provided the Justice Department, which regulates foreign influence campaigns through a 1938 statute known as the Foreign Agents Registration Act, a copy of the posts it paid influencers to disseminate, even though federal law requires the company to do so.<\/p>\n<p>Vipp Jaswal, Vippi Media\u2019s CEO, declined to share details about the posts with the AP.<\/p>\n<p>In other cases, the money and motives behind these Facebook posts, YouTube videos and podcasts are so murky that even those who create them say they weren\u2019t aware the Chinese government was financing the project.<\/p>\n<p>Chicago radio host John St. Augustine told the AP that a friend who owns New World Radio in Falls Church, Virginia, invited him to host a podcast called \u201cThe Bridge\u201d with a team in Beijing. The hosts discussed daily life and music in the US and China, inviting music industry workers as guests.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/Jessica-Zang-12.jpg?w=819\" alt=\"Jessica Zang\" \/>Jessica Zang describes herself as a video creator and blogger who hopes to present her followers with \u201cbeautiful pics and videos about life in China.\u201dInstagram\/ Jessica Zang    <\/p>\n<p>He says he didn\u2019t know CGTN had paid New World Radio $389,000 to produce the podcast.
