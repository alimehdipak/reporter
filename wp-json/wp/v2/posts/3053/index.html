It starred the character Turbo, and was his original home before taking over Sugar Rush, and becoming King Candy.<\/p>\n<p>What game is hero\u2019s duty based on?<\/p>\n<p>The game\u2019s name is an obvious play on the Call of Duty franchise, though the general overview of the game sounds nothing like it, more taking inspiration from the Gears of War and Halo franchises and Aliens: Extermination by Sega.<\/p>\n<p>Who is Wreck-It Ralph based off of?<\/p>\n<p>Ralph is actually based on the classic video game characters, Donkey Kong, or DK for short, and Knuckles the Echidna, in appearance and personality. In addition, one of Vanellope\u2019s nicknames for him is \u201cKnuckles\u201d, a possible reference to the character from the Sonic the Hedgehog series.<\/p>\n<p>How old is Vanellope von sweet?<\/p>\n<p>Trivia.

I had the same problem, with Wreck-it Ralph, I wanted to play Sugar Rush.

RoadBlasters was a real arcade racing game released by Atari in 1987. TurboTime\u200d\u2019s arcade cabinet seems to be the same design of Rally-X. TurboTime was right next to Fix-It Felix Jr.<\/p>\n<h3>What game is sugar rush on?<\/h3>\n<p>Sugar Rush is the location featured most prominently throughout the film and the franchise.
