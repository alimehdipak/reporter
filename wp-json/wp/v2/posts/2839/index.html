After retiring from playing lacrosse at UConn, the DC native decided to try her hand at writing about people playing sports.<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When legendary men&#8217;s basketball coach and broadcaster Jim Valvano died from cancer in 1993, he had already touched countless lives with the heartfelt rallying cry he delivered during his iconic ESPYS speech  &#8212; &#8220;Don&#8217;t Give Up &#8230; Don&#8217;t Ever Give Up!&#8221; &#8212; and his improbable run to the 1983 NCAA championship with the NC State Wolfpack. Now, Valvano will inspire another generation thanks to a new biopic about his extraordinary life.<\/p>\n<p>The film won&#8217;t lack for star power, as Ray Romano (&#8220;Everybody Loves Raymond&#8221;) will play Valvano. Romano also will produce alongside game1&#8217;s Basil Iwanyk, Greg Economou and Mark Ciardi (&#8220;The Rookie&#8221;). The script will be written by Jim Strouse, whose prior work includes &#8220;Grace is Gone&#8221; and &#8220;The Winning Season.&#8221; In addition, the Valvano family will serve as executive producers on the project.<\/p>\n<p>Next year marks the 40th anniversary of when Valvano and &#8220;The Cardiac Pack&#8221; claimed a last-second national championship victory over a highly favored Houston Cougars team that included future all-time NBA greats Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler and their &#8220;Phi Slama Jama&#8221; teammates, so it&#8217;s only fitting that the film is in the works now.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/espys\/story\/_\/id\/33888787\/\" \/>AP Photo\/Leonard Ignelzi<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t be more excited to finally tell my father&#8217;s story in the form of a feature film, especially with Ray Romano and game1 as partners,&#8221; Jamie Valvano, Jim and Pam Valvano&#8217;s middle daughter, told Deadline. &#8220;We had a front-row seat to one of the greatest stories of all time, and we are thrilled to share it with the entire world, as well.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Valvano&#8217;s legacy extends far beyond the basketball court. In addition to coaching at NC State (1980 to 1990), Johns Hopkins, Iona and Bucknell, he founded the V Foundation for Cancer Research with one goal in mind: to achieve &#8220;victory over cancer.&#8221; The V Foundation has awarded more than $290 million in cancer research grants nationwide and is one of the premier supporters of cutting-edge cancer research.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>May 9, 2022Tory BarronESPN Editor CloseTory Barron is a Bristol-based writer and editor for ESPN.com.
