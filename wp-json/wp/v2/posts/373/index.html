It was presented by a youthful-looking Karim Benzema, Marcelo and then-new signing Gareth Bale on a roof terrace opposite the Santiago Bernabeu. &#8220;Hopefully it will give us the energy and strength to win Champions League matches,&#8221; an impressed-sounding Marcelo said. Whether it was down to the kit or not, Madrid would indeed go on to win their 10th European crown that season.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/soccer\/blog-the-toe-poke\/story\/4618873\/\" \/>DIMITAR DILKOFF\/AFP via Getty Images<\/p>\n<p>The 2014-15 campaign brought not one, but two daring designs. In another first, the second jersey was pink, although the club described it as fuchsia. More exciting still was the third kit that year, another all-black kit designed by Yamamoto. The black jersey featured two dragons &#8212; the &#8220;dragon king&#8221; who was said to represent &#8220;the club&#8217;s greatness and glory&#8221; and the &#8220;bird dragon&#8221; which, the club said, was &#8220;an animal capable of adapting to the most hostile situations, just like Real Madrid.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/soccer\/blog-the-toe-poke\/story\/4618873\/\" \/>David S. Bustamante\/Soccrates\/Getty Images<\/p>\n<p>More recently, Madrid&#8217;s third kit in 2020-21 was another fashion-conscious choice, an elaborate black-and-grey design accented with pink trim. It boasted an equally detailed backstory, with the club saying the design was &#8220;linked to the roots and traditions of Madrid&#8221; and &#8220;inspired by the paintings on the ceramic tiles that grace the city.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/soccer\/blog-the-toe-poke\/story\/4618873\/\" \/>PAU BARRENA\/AFP via Getty Images<\/p>\n<p>As for Barca: you can&#8217;t go wrong with <i>blaugrana<\/i> stripes, can you? Right? Wrong. Barcelona, tired of their traditional vertical stripes and seeking innovation, have started to test out different designs in recent years. Most of them have been met with fan criticism. There was outrage in 2015-16 when, on the back of a Treble-winning season, they switched to horizontal stripes for the first time in history.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/soccer\/blog-the-toe-poke\/story\/4618873\/\" \/>Pablo Morano\/MB Media\/Getty Images<\/p>\n<p>Four years later, ahead of the 2019-20 campaign, there was disbelief when they released a checked home shirt, akin to the Croatian national team&#8217;s jersey.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/soccer\/blog-the-toe-poke\/story\/4618873\/\" \/>John Berry\/Getty Images<\/p>\n<p>However, as with most clubs, it&#8217;s the away kits that have been the most experimental.
