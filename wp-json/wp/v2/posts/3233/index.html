I know, he knew exactly what he was doing because I already told him.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Anderson claims while Donaldson played for the Minnesota Twins, the two had no contact, but that changed after a hard slide into third base by the shortstop in a game in Chicago between the two teams. The two players had words that night and then again this past weekend in New York, leading to Donaldson calling Anderson &#8220;Jackie&#8221; once again.<\/p>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p>Donaldson said the &#8220;Jackie&#8221; comment was in reference to a 2019 interview with Sports Illustrated in which Anderson described himself as feeling like &#8220;today&#8217;s Jackie Robinson&#8221; in how he&#8217;s &#8220;getting to a point where I need to change the game.&#8221; Donaldson said it was a reference about which he has &#8220;joked around&#8221; with Anderson in the past.<\/p>\n<p>Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge said Donaldson made &#8220;a mistake.&#8221; And the league, in suspending Donaldson, felt his comment was &#8220;disrespectful and in poor judgment.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Anderson was asked if he felt the one-game suspension and fine was appropriate.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s out of my control, so I&#8217;m cool with whatever,&#8221; Anderson said. &#8220;I could care less about the suspension.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>White Sox general manager Rick Hahn was equally vague about his opinion on the punishment but was more than happy with his team&#8217;s response to the incident, both on and off the field. A day after the Donaldson comment, the White Sox swept the Yankees in a doubleheader.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Tremendously proud of the way teammates coalesced around TA this weekend,&#8221; Hahn said. &#8220;The support that was shown both on the field and in the clubhouse was remarkable.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Anderson&#8217;s three-run home run in Game 2 was a highlight for the All-Star shortstop. Some Yankees fans had been chanting &#8220;Jackie&#8221; during some of his at-bats that day.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It was pretty dope for me to shut them up,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Anderson said he hasn&#8217;t heard from the Yankees or Donaldson, and that&#8217;s just fine with him.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not looking for no friendship or relationship from that behalf,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to keep playing hard and being a great teammate.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Anderson indicated he&#8217;s heard from all corners of the baseball world and is appreciative of the &#8220;love and support&#8221; he has received. He was asked if he thought Donaldson at least received a message from the league after being punished.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; Anderson said.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>CHICAGO &#8212; White Sox shortstop Tim Anderson says there was no inside joke between he and New York Yankees third baseman Josh Donaldson regarding Donaldson calling Anderson &#8220;Jackie&#8221; over the weekend, in reference to Jackie Robinson.Anderson, speaking publicly on Tuesday for the first time since Major League Baseball punished Donaldson with a one-game suspension, said&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":3234,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[13],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3233"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3233"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3233\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3233"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3233"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3233"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
