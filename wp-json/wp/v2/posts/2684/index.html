The German actress and model arrived in a lime green gown with a train and cut-outs that showed off her abs, searing bright-pink eyeshadow and a gargantuan engagement ring with a square-cut diamond as big as the Ritz.<\/p>\n<p>After years of subtler sparklers and sweet, semiprecious stones, Kruger\u2019s show-stopping rock threw down a gauntlet.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Brides \u2014 weary of COVID-era austerity and caution \u2014 are embracing the big, bold and brilliant. And what better way to announce it than with a flashy ring?<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/diane-kruger-ring.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Diane Kruger has been turning heads with her enormous, square-shaped sparkler.

He applauds the trend toward more exuberant, more extra jewels \u2014 from pear-shaped gems, \u00e0 la Liz Taylor, to brightly hued stones, which enhance the celebratory vibe.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMore people are getting engaged and getting married this year than the year before,\u201d Broekema continues. \u201cThere are so many people in this market, people want to set themselves apart \u2014 what makes their ring different, what makes their wedding different, what makes their engagement moment different?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As for \u201cdifferent,\u201d look no further than the \u201ctwin flames\u201d that rapper Machine Gun Kelly designed for actress Megan Fox. The ring incorporates two large pear-shaped gems representing each of their birthstones \u2014 a diamond for him, an emerald for her \u2014 set on a band of thorns.

But we do a lot of two-stone diamond rings, and for the really unique, avant-garde type of woman, we do get requests for a diamond and a sapphire, or a diamond and a ruby \u2014 something of that nature.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Udell, however, says that even more traditional brides want to stand out, with more and more women opting for mixed metals (like platinum for the head and rose or yellow gold for the shoulders and shank) or requesting long stones, such as \u201cTo All the Boys\u201d star Lana Condor\u2019s oval stone set off by smaller diamonds down the side.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/05\/lana-condor-ring.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\u201cX-Men\u201d actress Lana Condor said yes to an elegant oval engagement stone.
