Since then, a couple of things have changed &#8212; like more than 1,600 players entering the transfer portal and more than 250 submitting their name to the NBA draft&#8217;s early-entry process.<\/p>\n<p>But both deadlines have now passed, with the early-entry one coming in late April and the one for immediately eligible transfer portal coming late Sunday night. (There is a chance a couple of names could pop into the portal over the next 24 hours. Schools have up to 48 hours to submit names into the portal after receiving a student-athlete&#8217;s paperwork, which was due at 11:59 p.m. on May 1.)<\/p>\n<p>Naturally, it was time for a complete makeover in the rankings.<\/p>\n<p>So, what&#8217;s changed?<\/p>\n<p>Well, we have a new No. 1 after the majority of North Carolina&#8217;s core announced it was returning to Chapel Hill. And Creighton went flying into the top five after a key transfer portal addition.<\/p>\n<p>Just a quick refresh on the guidelines:<\/p>\n<p>First, any player on the early-entry list currently projected by ESPN to be selected in June&#8217;s NBA draft is considered a departure, for now. So, that&#8217;s anyone in the top 60. That means we&#8217;re counting Drew Timme, Jaylin Williams, Trevor Keels, Christian Braun and Dalen Terry as gone. If they return, that will be reflected in the next rankings update.<\/p>\n<p>Second, seniors with another year of eligibility due to the COVID year are considered departures, unless they have stated they are planning to return or are considering a return to school. We&#8217;ll adjust as players decide.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/mens-college-basketball\/story\/_\/page\/earlytop25050322\/\" \/>Hubert Davis&#8217; chances of redemption in 2022-23 are significantly higher now that four of last season&#8217;s five starters &#8212; Leaky Black, Caleb Love, R.J.

In Quinerly and Ohio transfer Mark Sears, Alabama has a guard duo capable of playing on or off the ball, creating plays off the bounce and making shots from the perimeter. Five-star guard Jaden Bradley is more of a distributor and facilitator, but having three ball handlers and playmakers on the floor will make the Tide awfully difficult to defend. Five-star forward Brandon Miller has a high ceiling, and former Texas Tech transfer Nimari Burnett should be healthy. There are some questions down low, but Charles Bediako and Noah Gurley are both back. I could see Bama making a move for a true wing in the portal too.<\/p>\n<p>Projected starting lineup:<\/p>\n<p>Jahvon Quinerly (13.8 PPG)<br \/>Mark Sears (19.6 PPG at Ohio)<br \/>Jaden Bradley (No. 19 in ESPN 100)<br \/>Brandon Miller (No. 9 in ESPN 100)<br \/>Charles Bediako (6.7 PPG)<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/mens-college-basketball\/story\/_\/page\/earlytop25050322\/\" \/>Zakai Zeigler will be a key game-changer for Rick Barnes in 2022-23.\u00a0AP Photo\/Michael Conroy<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/ncaa\/500\/2633.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<p><em>Previous: 14<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Tennessee has seen a lot of its depth leave the program so far this offseason, but Rick Barnes has enough to stay inside the top 20 nationally. And he is still active in the transfer portal. Four players who started at least 21 games last season &#8212; Santiago Vescovi, Josiah-Jordan James, Olivier Nkamhoua and Uros Plavsic &#8212; are expected back in Knoxville, as is Zakai Zeigler. Zeigler proved himself to be a game-changer in the second half of last season, putting pressure on opponents at both ends of the floor and giving the Volunteers a third playmaker in the backcourt. He&#8217;ll have a bigger role next season. Tennessee also landed Indiana State transfer Tyreke Key, who averaged 17.2 points two seasons ago for the Sycamores. The Tennessee native should provide instant offense off the bench.<\/p>\n<p>Projected starting lineup:<\/p>\n<p>Zakai Zeigler (8.8 PPG)<br \/>Santiago Vescovi (13.3 PPG)<br \/>Josiah-Jordan James (10.3 PPG)<br \/>Olivier Nkamhoua (8.6 PPG)<br \/>Uros Plavsic (4.2 PPG)<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/teamlogos\/ncaa\/500\/2168.png?w=110&amp;h=110&amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\" \/><\/p>\n<p><em>Previous: 18<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Dayton is going to be an awfully intriguing team entering the season. The Flyers had some of the best wins of anyone in the country &#8212; against Kansas, Virginia Tech and Miami. But they also had a slew of dreadful losses, and they missed the NCAA tournament as a result. All five starters are back for Anthony Grant, as well as his first two players off the bench. Grant also brings in ESPN 100 prospect Mike Sharavjamts and Georgia transfer Tyrone Baker, who has size and a high ceiling. The key will be consistency, but given that six of Dayton&#8217;s top seven players were freshmen, that should come with experience. Malachi Smith, Toumani Camara and DaRon Holmes II should form one of the best trios in the Atlantic 10. And Holmes, who averaged 20 points, six rebounds and two blocks on 68.3% shooting in his final five games last season, is an NBA prospect.<\/p>\n<p>Projected starting lineup:<\/p>\n<p>Malachi Smith (9.3 PPG)<br \/>Kobe Elvis (8.9 PPG)<br \/>R.J.

That means all five starters and the top six scorers from this past season will be back for Virginia, along with three ESPN 100 transfers and an all-conference transfer in Vander Plas. After seemingly not having enough offensive weapons in 2021-22, Bennett should be able to attack teams in a number of ways at that end of the floor. We also should expect Virginia to return to form defensively after ranking in the middle of the pack in the ACC last season.

Newton was one of the best point guards in the portal, while Alleyne is a very good shooter with size. Star big man Adama Sanogo returns up front, and he&#8217;ll anchor the team offensively and on the glass.

Boum led Conference USA in scoring and shot nearly 37% from 3. That doesn&#8217;t quite give the Musketeers a pure point guard, but he and Kam Craft &#8212; an underrated recruit &#8212; should form a hard-to-guard backcourt duo, and Adam Kunkel returns as an effective outside shooter.
