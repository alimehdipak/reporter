Here are the top five acne treatments that have been found to be most effective:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>1. Acne medications<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acne medications can be grouped into two categories: those that clear up skin lesions and those that prevent them from occurring in the first place. The two main types of acne medications are topical and systemic. Topical acne medications work to clear up skin lesions by reducing the amount of oil and bacteria on the surface of the skin. Systemic acne medications work to prevent new lesions from forming by blocking hormones that stimulate the growth of skin cells.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>2. Acne cleansers<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acne is a common skin condition that can be difficult to treat. Some acne cleansers are available over the counter, while others require a prescription. Over-the-counter acne cleansers typically contain benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, and salicylic acid. Prescription acne cleansers may also contain azelaic acid or retinoids. Many people find that using an acne cleanser regularly helps clear up their skin.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>3.
