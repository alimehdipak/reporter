That was preceded by two seasons in which Beal averaged at least 30 points per game &#8212; including 31.3 points per game across 60 games during the 2020-21 season.<\/p>\n<p><img data-src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0628\/r1030165_1296x729_16-9.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2022\/0628\/r1030165_1296x729_16-9.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Stay up to date on the latest NBA free agency and trade news all summer long:<\/p>\n<p>The No. 3 pick in the 2012 NBA draft, Beal is in the top five in a host of all-time statistical categories for the Wizards &#8212; including making, and attempting, the most 3-pointers in team history. Now, he&#8217;ll get a chance to take aim at virtually every statistical mark the franchise has to offer.<\/p>\n<p>Washington hopes those milestones will be accompanied by victories. The Wizards, after making the Eastern Conference semifinals three out of four years earlier in Beal&#8217;s career, have reached the postseason just once in the past four years, when Washington exited in five games against the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round of the 2021 NBA playoffs.<\/p>\n<p>Last year, with Beal sidelined for half the season, the Wizards finished in 12th place in the East &#8212; a distant eight games out of the 10th and final play-in tournament spot.<\/p>\n<p>Now, Washington will wait and see what Beal looks like alongside the team&#8217;s marquee midseason addition: center Kristaps Porzingis, who has yet to play a game with Beal after being acquired in a deal with the Dallas Mavericks.<\/p>\n<p>The Wizards, under second-year coach Wes Unseld Jr. and team president of basketball operations Tommy Sheppard, added to the roster earlier this week by sending out guards Ish Smith and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope in exchange for guards Monte Morris and Will Barton, with Morris set to take over as the team&#8217;s starting point guard alongside Beal in Washington&#8217;s backcourt.<\/p>\n<p>Washington also picked up free agent Delon Wright, agreeing to a two-year, $16 million deal with the former Hawks guard, his agent Greg Lawrence of Wasserman Basketball told Wojnarowski on Thursday.<\/p>\n<p>Wright, 30, scored at a career-low-rate last season on an Atlanta Hawks team that had a lot of mouths to feed on offense. However, his efficiency (45% from the field, 38% from 3) and passing (nearly 5 assists per 36 minutes) looked as strong as ever.<\/p>\n<p>At 6-foot-5, Wright combines a useful set of skills that include ballhandling, passing, defense and shooting. He saw his minutes increase to 27 minutes per game in Atlanta&#8217;s first-round series against the Miami Heat, where he averaged 8.2 points and 2.8 assists while shooting over 50% from the field and 38% from 3.<\/p>\n<p>Washington has several young players who could play a role as well, including the team&#8217;s past four first-round picks: guard Johnny Davis, the 10th pick in this year&#8217;s draft, and forwards Corey Kispert, Rui Hachimura and Deni Avdija.<\/p>\n<p>The Wizards also agreed to a two-year deal with Anthony Gill, sources told Wojnarowski. He spent the last two seasons in Washington, averaging 3.7 points in 9.7 minutes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>All-Star guard Bradley Beal has agreed to a five-year, $251 million maximum contract to stay with the Washington Wizards, his agent Mark Bartelstein of Priority Sports told ESPN&#8217;s Adrian Wojnarowski as NBA free agency opened Thursday.Beal, who has played his entire 10-year career with the Wizards, has now committed himself to the franchise for the&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":4217,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[13],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4216"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4216"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4216\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":6392,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4216\/revisions\/6392"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4216"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4216"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4216"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
