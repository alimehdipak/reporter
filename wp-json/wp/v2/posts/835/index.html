This is a much cheaper option than buying a new iPhone.<\/p>\n<h2>Phone randomly restarting<\/h2>\n<p>Your iPhone randomly restarting isn\u2019t always a major cause for concern \u2013 but it could be.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s especially problematic if it\u2019s happening a lot, for no apparent reason.<\/p>\n<p>One simple cause for your iPhone restarting is that\u00a0it got too hot or cold.<\/p>\n<p>A cold restart isn\u2019t too bad \u2013 it should return to normal once the battery warms up.<\/p>\n<p>But overheating can seriously damage parts of the iPhone, including the battery.<\/p>\n<p>Other reasons for a restart could be internal damage, or possibly some software issue \u2013 like a dodgy app.<\/p>\n<p>If your iPhone is frequently turning off (and not because of temperature) then you should get it checked out.<\/p>\n<h2>Camera and microphone dots<\/h2>\n<p>Your iPhone has two warning signs to show if you\u2019re being spied on.<\/p>\n<p>They\u2019ll appear as either\u00a0green or orange dots at the top of the phone.<\/p>\n<p>They don\u2019t necessarily mean someone is snooping \u2013 but they might, and can prompt you to investigate.<\/p>\n<p>The alert was added in an\u00a0iOS update\u00a0in 2020 and appears whenever your microphone or camera is activated.<\/p>\n<p>That means if any app is secretly recording you, you\u2019ll be warned about it.<\/p>\n<p>To see the dots, you\u2019ll need to be using a device operating iOS 14 or 15 \u2013 go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update to check.<\/p>\n<p>A green dot will appear in the upper right corner of the display when the camera\u2019s activated.<\/p>\n<p>And it shows as orange if the microphone is activated.<\/p>\n<p>By swiping into your Control Centre, you\u2019ll be able to see details about which app is using the microphone.<\/p>\n<p>So if it\u2019s an app that you think shouldn\u2019t be using the camera or microphone, you might want to worry.<\/p>\n<p>If you think something is snooping on you when it shouldn\u2019t be, you should check the app\u2019s permissions in Settings.<\/p>\n<p>You can even deny specific apps access to your microphone or camera, for instance.<\/p>\n<p>And if you\u2019re really worried, you could just delete the app altogether.<\/p>\n<h2>No more iOS updates<\/h2>\n<p>Apple regularly introduces new versions of its iPhone software \u2013 and\u00a0we\u2019re currently on iOS 15.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually, Apple stops supporting older models with updates, which is\u00a0very bad news if you\u2019re affected.<\/p>\n<p>These updates include vital security updates that patch serious problems with your device.<\/p>\n<p>So if you can\u2019t get those updates, you\u2019re at serious risk of being hacked.<\/p>\n<p>The current iOS 15.4 supports phones all the way back to the iPhone 6S and iPhone SE (1st gen).<\/p>\n<p>Check if you\u2019re still getting the latest updates in Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not then it\u2019s highly recommended that you upgrade your iPhone to a newer model that still gets security updates.<\/p>\n<h2>Ghost touches<\/h2>\n<p>Ghost touches are when your iPhone \u201ctaps\u201d parts of the screen without you doing anything.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s very unusual for this to be a software issue.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, it\u2019s most likely linked to screen or water damage, or some other kind of internal issue.<\/p>\n<p>If you notice this (especially if it\u2019s getting worse) then take your iPhone to the Apple Store for a check-up.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s possible that you might need parts replaced. This could end up being costly, so it may even be cheaper to buy a new iPhone depending on the model.<\/p>\n<h2>Red water strip<\/h2>\n<p>Water damage is the bane of any gadget owner\u2019s life.<\/p>\n<p>If liquid gets inside your iPhone, it can void the warranty and result in costly repairs.<\/p>\n<p>When you take an iPhone to be fixed, Apple will usually check the Liquid Contact Indicator (LCI).<\/p>\n<p>This is a part of the device that changes color when it comes into contact with water.<\/p>\n<p>You can\u00a0find this yourself: on recent iPhone models, it\u2019s inside the SIM card slot.<\/p>\n<p>Use a torch and magnifying glass if you\u2019re struggling to see the color.<\/p>\n<p>The LCI will normally be white or silver but turns red if it\u2019s been in contact with water.<\/p>\n<p>Apple has a\u00a0page\u00a0revealing how to find the LCI on every iPhone model.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAn LCI will be activated when it comes into contact with water or a liquid containing water,\u201d said Apple.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAn LCI won\u2019t be activated because of humidity and temperature changes that are within the product\u2019s environmental requirements.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Most modern iPhones are water-resistant, but it\u2019s a good idea to avoid soakings where possible.<\/p>\n<p><em>This article originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced here with permission. <\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Apple\u2019s iPhones are well-oiled machines \u2013 but there are some key warning signs that things are working properly.
