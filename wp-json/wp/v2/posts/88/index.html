There\u2019s wheels on everything. I have wheels on my garment rack, makeup storage holder, rubbish bin. It\u2019s definitely wheels,\u201d one person exclaimed. <\/p>\n<p>Another added, \u201cEasily doors There\u2019s double the number of homes in the world than there is cars Then there are other types of buildings too, eg shops, businesses etc Then on top of that, most vehicles have many doors too.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A user jokingly asked if one should count \u201csteering wheels and spare wheels?\u201d Someone else argued, \u201cDoors by far. Most things with wheels have at least a 2:1 door-wheel ratio, and then you have all the other doors in the world.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>One viewer attempted to explain the logic that \u201cwheeled constructions always have doors. Doored structures don\u2019t always have wheels. There are substantially more doored structures than wheeled structures.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/03\/doors-wheels-56.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Two identical red doors in Dublin, Ireland\" \/>Open, sesame!Alexander Spatari    <\/p>\n<p>Several people took to documenting the ratio of doors to wheels at their current place of residence. Someone noted that grocery stores \u201chave many more wheels than doors.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThink of all the wheels in the elevators, wheels in all the drawers in desks, every chair in the building has 4 wheels on it, there would be 100:1 ratio of wheels to doors in a building alone,\u201d another person stated.<\/p>\n<p>Others were confused on the argument\u2019s edict, wondering if the doors and wheels constituted every single item that had ever existed or just the ones currently present. <\/p>\n<p>One wrote, \u201cJust to confuse this debate do you mean EVER or NOW? as this very much alters my answer. Also is a broken door or wheel still a door or wheel? I need some rules here.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t the first time the world has been embattled in a seemingly senseless debate. Back in 2015, the masses were divided when a dress went viral on whether its true colors were gold and white or black and blue. <\/p>\n<p>Ironically the door on that debate is still wide open.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Social media is having a wheelie big dilemma at the moment.
