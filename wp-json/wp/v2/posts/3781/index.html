I like to call it failing forward. Mistakes and failures are inevitable, but I refuse to let mine go to waste.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help<\/h3>\n<p>Monique turned to her friends, her boyfriend and fellow creators to help her get up again after that first campaign went sideways. \u201cHaving a support system really helps when you\u2019re suffering from self-doubt,\u201d Monique says. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to ask for help. You\u2019d be surprised at how many people want to help you and to see you succeed.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Share your highs and lows with your followers<\/h3>\n<p>Monique also says creators shouldn\u2019t be afraid to share their challenges and mistakes with their followers. \u201dPeople love a comeback story and things they can relate to.
