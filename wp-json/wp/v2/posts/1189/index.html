Will he get them over the hump?\u00a0AP Photo\/Michael Conroy<\/p>\n<p>Ryan is seven years Wentz\u2019s senior, and his best years may be behind him, but the belief is that the Colts are getting a more mature player at the position.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCertainly seems like an adult move,\u201d ESPN NFL analyst Dan Orlovsky said. \u201cI know it seems like a negative shot at Carson, but it\u2019s not meant to be. It\u2019s also hard not to sit there and say that a lot of things off the field were lacking. Sounds like that.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And now they\u2019re getting a guy [Ryan] who is completely capable of being the CEO of a billion dollar company and having the responsibility of that every single day. I think there\u2019s value in that, there\u2019s no questions asked.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Colts don\u2019t regret trading for Wentz, despite giving the Philadelphia Eagles their 2022 first-round pick in the deal, but at the same time, they also basically acknowledged it was a mistake by trading him to the Commanders for a third-round pick earlier this month.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/chui-assets-cdn.espn.com\/21b5e10b-54dc-446a-879f-9529689b5f2f.jpeg\" width=\"100%\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Answer questions on the 2022 NFL draft for a chance to win $100,000! <b>Make Your Picks<\/b><\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI wish Carson well, I think he has a chance to go into a different environment and play great in Washington,\u201d Colts owner Jim Irsay told reporters at the NFL owners meetings earlier this week. \u201cIt\u2019s just, for us, it was something we had to move away from as a franchise. It was very obvious.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Colts went into this offseason with no direction at quarterback. All they knew is they couldn\u2019t bring Wentz back for a second season, even if it they had no idea who their starter would be in 2022 due to a mediocre quarterback market. Colts general manager Chris Ballard admits they got lucky by landing Ryan. That may not have happened had the Atlanta Falcons not gotten into the mix for Deshaun Watson, who eventually chose the Cleveland Browns.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTo sit here and say we just had a flat-out plan that the QB [position] was going to work out, we didn\u2019t,\u201d Ballard told reporters during the owners meeting.<img data-src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2021\/1116\/r938142_608x342_16-9.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2021\/1116\/r938142_608x342_16-9.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u2022 For Lance and the 49ers, it&#8217;s time<br \/>\u2022 Darnold trade still impacting Jets, Panthers<br \/>\u2022 How GMs know they&#8217;re ready to draft<br \/>\u2022 Can Wentz alter Commanders&#8217; course?<br \/>\u2022 Areas Bengals must address in draft<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>The Colts now feel like they have some short-term stability at quarterback as they search for their eventual successor to Ryan at the position. Ryan has started every game he\u2019s played \u2013 while missing only three games \u2013 since being taken as the No. 3 overall pick in 2008. He was the NFL MVP in 2016.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI really feel strongly that Matt is what the franchise needs,\u201d Irsay said at the owners meetings. \u201cI really think we have an opportunity, and he\u2019s young enough, to win a world championship with him. We feel like we have that capability.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>One thing Reich is well equipped to do because of the constant changing at quarterback is cater his offensive playbook to whomever the starter is at the time.<\/p>\n<p>Ryan, unlike Wentz, is more of a pocket passer who excels at play-action.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019ll be a little bit more of Frank adjusting to Matt,\u201d Orlovsky said. \u201cMatt has not been a guy notorious for running a lot of [run-pass options]. That\u2019s a big part of what they did offensively last year with the Colts \u2026<img data-src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2021\/1213\/nfl_mcshay-mock-draft_16x9_608x342.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/photo\/2021\/1213\/nfl_mcshay-mock-draft_16x9_608x342.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Ranks:<\/b> Kiper \u00bb | McShay \u00bb | Positions \u00bb<br \/>\u2022 <b>Mocks:<\/b> Kiper \u00bb | McShay \u00bb | Reid \u00bb<br \/>\u2022 Stacking the QBs \u00bb | Intriguing teams \u00bb<br \/>\u2022 Full draft order \u00bb | First Draft podcast \u00bb<br \/>\u2022 <b>More coverage \u00bb | Full rankings \u00bb<\/b><\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Matt had his best years playing play-action football, but that\u2019s probably going to be the case for any quarterback. I would say, if you ask me, the most important physical part of his game, or the best physical part of his game, is his ball placement. His ability to be really accurate, and that\u2019s something that, in [the Colts&#8217;] offense, is a demanded aspect of the game.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ryan, who has completed 65.5% of his career pass attempts, is only one piece of an offensive puzzle that is still missing several parts &#8212; like a starting left tackle after moving on from Eric Fisher, a starting tight end after Jack Doyle retired and some receivers to help Michael Pittman Jr.<\/p>\n<p>Ryan is talented, but it\u2019ll be difficult for him \u2013 and the Colts \u2013 to be successful if Ballard doesn\u2019t address those areas, especially with the AFC expected to be even more competitive next season.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI feel pretty good saying [Ryan] probably has two good years,\u201d Orlovsky said. \u201cI think again, being real, it\u2019s going to be hard for him to have a really good year if some of those personnel questions aren\u2019t answered. They are very real questions. He can play good but still get beat up by an offensive line that wasn\u2019t great in pass pro last year and doesn\u2019t have a left tackle currently. How good he\u2019ll be will be based off how many of the offensive questions are answered.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>INDIANAPOLIS \u2013 And now there will be six.Six seasons.Six different Week 1 starting quarterbacks for the Indianapolis Colts.It\u2019s surprising that coach Frank Reich\u2019s head isn\u2019t spinning in circles nonstop, because he\u2019s yet to have the same starting quarterback in back-to-back seasons since his arrival in Indianapolis in 2018.It\u2019s Matt Ryan\u2019s turn to see if he&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":1190,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[13],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1189"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1189"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1189\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1189"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1189"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1189"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
