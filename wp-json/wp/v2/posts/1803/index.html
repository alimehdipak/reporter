It will be dangerous, cramped, difficult, hard work,\u201d Musk said during a recent interview with the head of TED conferences, Chris Anderson.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe sales pitch for going to Mars is, \u2018it\u2019s dangerous, it\u2019s cramped, you might not make it back. It\u2019s difficult, it\u2019s hard work.\u2019 That\u2019s the sales pitch. But it\u2019ll be glorious,\u201d Musk added.<\/p>\n<p>SpaceX has already begun testing prototype designs for the 400-foot \u201cStarship\u201d rocket, as well as a launchpad in Florida capable of accommodating the massive vehicle. During the interview, Musk said it was \u201clooking promising\u201d for SpaceX to attempt its first orbital launch of the shuttle \u201cin a few months.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/spacex-starship-3.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"SpaceX Starship\" \/>Each Starship will be capable of carrying roughly 100 passengers.AFP via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>Musk acknowledged that the early launch attempt carries a certain amount of risk.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe joke I make all the time is excitement is guaranteed. Success is not guaranteed, but excitement certainly is,\u201d Musk said.<\/p>\n<p>Last year, Musk predicted that humanity would reach Mars within the next 10 years \u2013 though building a functioning colony will take far longer.<\/p>\n<p>    <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"758\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/04\/spacex-starship.jpg?w=758\" alt=\"SpaceX Starship\" \/>SpaceX is close to conducting its first orbital launch of the Starship.AFP via Getty Images    <\/p>\n<p>Musk said it would likely be necessary to land \u201csomething on the order of a thousand ships,\u201d each carrying about 100 passengers, in order to develop a self-sustaining colony. He also floated a hypothetical price point of about $100,000 per person to make the trip.<\/p>\n<p>The billionaire has insisted that a Mars colony will help preserve humanity\u2019s future from various existential threats.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think this is important for maximizing the probable lifespan of humanity or consciousness,\u201d Musk said. \u201cHuman civilization could come to an end for external reasons like a giant meteor or super volcanoes or extreme climate change or World War III, or you know, any one of a number of reasons.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A human colony on Mars is just one of several concerns for Musk, who is currently attempting to buy Twitter outright. As The Post reported on Tuesday, the billionaire is willing to put up $15 billion of his own money to close the deal.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The first settlers to arrive on Mars shouldn\u2019t expect a glamorous lifestyle or even safe conditions during their stay, according to the leading proponent of human exploration of the red planet, Elon&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":1804,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[14],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1803"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1803"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1803\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1803"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1803"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1803"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
