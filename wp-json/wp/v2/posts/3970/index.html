Those are the three guys, when I look at these last 15 years.&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>&#8212; Basketball Hall of Famer Isiah Thomas, on Curry.<\/p>\n<h2>&#8220;Holy cannoli.&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>Klay Thompson, after winning the NBA Finals.<\/p>\n<h2>&#8220;As far as accuracy wise, I&#8217;m going with Tua all day.&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>&#8212; Tyreek Hill, on comparing his new quarterback Tua Tagovailoa with his old quarterback Patrick Mahomes<\/p>\n<h2>&#8220;I&#8217;m surprised a little just because I feel like we love Tyreek here. We&#8217;ve always loved him. We still love him. I saw him out at Formula One in Miami. I&#8217;m sure it had something to do with trying to get his podcast some stuff and get it rolling.&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>&#8212; Mahomes, responding to Hill&#8217;s criticism<\/p>\n<h2>&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty sure I know who it was. I recognized the two kids that were running the opposite way with a smile on their face. I am 100% sure I saw the two kids that stole it.&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>&#8212; Jon Rahm, on the two kids who ran off with his golf ball on the 18th hole at the U.S. Open.<\/p>\n<h2>&#8220;I&#8217;m an Aggie; Texas was playing. I was going to give them a &#8216;Go Pokes&#8217; and then a Horns Down after the anthem. And that&#8217;s exactly what I did. And three hours after I sang the anthem, I got an email saying that I wasn&#8217;t scheduled to sing for the Men&#8217;s College World Series anymore.&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>&#8212; Texas A&amp;M alumnus Zach Collier, on having his performance at the Men&#8217;s College World Series canceled because he made the Horns Down gesture before a Women&#8217;s College World Series semifinal between Texas and Oklahoma State.<\/p>\n<h2>&#8220;I understand. Yes, because a lot of these guys are in their late 40s. In Phil [Mickelson]&#8217;s case, early 50s. Yeah, I think everyone in this room would say to themselves that their best days are behind them. That&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t understand for the guys that are a similar age to me going because I would like to believe that my best days are still ahead of me, and I think theirs are, too. So that&#8217;s where it feels like you&#8217;re taking the easy way out.&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>&#8212; Rory McIlroy, criticizing younger golfers who&#8217;ve joined the LIV Golf Invitational Series.
