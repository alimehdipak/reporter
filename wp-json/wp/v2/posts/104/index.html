She threw a curveball up and out over the plate, and Alo crushed it 40 feet above the 200-foot sign in right-center field.<\/p>\n<p>Alo bounded out of the batter&#8217;s box, sure of the ball&#8217;s final destination, and ran around the bases throwing the shaka hand gesture and pointing to her family in the crowd. Her teammates mobbed her at the plate, and she later came out of the dugout for a curtain call, a lei around her neck. Her reaction was equal parts exuberance and relief.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\" src=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/college-sports\/story\/_\/id\/33482004\/\" \/>Jocelyn Alo had about two dozen family members on hand Friday to see her become NCAA softball&#8217;s all-time leader in home runs.\u00a0Courtesy Oklahoma<\/p>\n<p>Since tying the record, Alo&#8217;s quest had been stymied for eight games as nearly every opposing pitcher refused to give her anything she could drive. In those eight games, Alo walked 18 times and was hit by a pitch, bringing her on-base percentage to an NCAA-best .667. The eight games without a homer tied the second-longest such stretch of her career.<\/p>\n<p>Although Alo never showed frustration as opponent after opponent pitched around her, the strategy caused consternation among the Sooners, mostly because it seemed to serve no purpose other than to keep Alo from the record. Oklahoma, the No. 1 team in the country with the best offense, is 18-0 on the season and won six of those eight games by run rule.<\/p>\n<p>When Alo was intentionally walked in the third inning against Cal on Friday afternoon, the crowd &#8212; which included the softball team from Alo&#8217;s high school &#8212; reacted with anger and disbelief. When the inning ended, Oklahoma coach Patty Gasso came out of the Sooners&#8217; dugout and had what appeared to be a friendly but pointed conversation with Cal coach Chelsea Spencer.<\/p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Seasons<\/th>\n<th>Player, School<\/th>\n<th>HRs<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>2018-Pres.<\/td>\n<td>Jocelyn Alo, OU<\/td>\n<td>96*<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2012-15<\/td>\n<td>Lauren Chamberlain, OU<\/td>\n<td>95<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2017-21<\/td>\n<td>Jessie Harper, ARIZ<\/td>\n<td>92<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2014-17<\/td>\n<td>Katiyana Mauga, ARIZ<\/td>\n<td>92<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<tfoot>\n<tr>\n<td>&#8212; Includes one Friday<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tfoot>\n<\/table>\n<p>The Sooners won 11-0 in six innings.<\/p>\n<p>Alo broke the record of another Sooner, Lauren Chamberlain, who expressed unwavering support for Alo throughout her chase for the record.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I just care so much for her as a person that I can&#8217;t help but root for her,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s being broken every year.
