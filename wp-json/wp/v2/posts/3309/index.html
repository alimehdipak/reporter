Tea rehydrates you and provides antioxidants.<\/p>\n<h3>Does a cup of tea count as water intake?<\/h3>\n<p>The Eatwell Guide says we should drink 6 to 8 cups or glasses of fluid a day. Water, lower-fat milk and sugar-free drinks, including tea and coffee, all count.<\/p>\n<p>Is it okay to replace water with tea?<\/p>\n<p>Carrie Ruxton, a nutritionist who authored a study and survey published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition that looked at the health and hydrating benefits of tea, you\u2019re not only totally fine to replace straight-up H2O with mugs of tea, it might actually be the better option for you overall.<\/p>\n<p>Can I drink tea all day?<\/p>\n<p>Though moderate intake is healthy for most people, drinking too much could lead to negative side effects, such as anxiety, headaches, digestive issues, and disrupted sleep patterns. Most people can drink 3\u20134 cups (710\u2013950 ml) of tea daily without adverse effects, but some may experience side effects at lower doses.<\/p>\n<p>Is tea dehydrating or hydrating?<\/p>\n<p>Tea is a low-caffeine drink, so the diuretic effect is minimal. On the whole, tea gives your body much more water than it causes your body to lose. So drinking hot tea or iced tea helps to hydrate your body overall.<\/p>\n<h3>Does tea help you lose weight?<\/h3>\n<p>Teas have a type of flavonoid called catechins that may boost metabolism and help your body break down fats more quickly. And the caffeine in many teas increases your energy use, causing your body to burn more calories. These two compounds probably work best together for any weight loss that may occur.<\/p>\n<p>What liquids count as water intake?<\/p>\n<p>Bottom line. To meet your fluid needs throughout the day, choose water most often. Remember that other fluids like milk, coffee, tea and juice also count towards your daily fluid intake. Try to avoid soft drinks and limit drinks with caffeine to 3 cups per day.<\/p>\n<p>How much tea can you drink a day?<\/p>\n<p>Some studies show health benefits in people who drink as little as one cup per day, while other studies deem five or more cups per day to be optimal (15, 16 ). Green tea may help lower the risk of several diseases. However, the optimal amount to drink may depend on the disease.<\/p>\n<p>Can tea make you gain weight?<\/p>\n<p>You may gain weight because of what you\u2019re adding.<\/p>\n<p>Turning tea into an SSB (a.k.a. a sugar-sweetened beverage) by dumping tablespoons of sugar or honey in or making \u201cmilk tea\u201d can lead to weight gain if you drink enough of it.<\/p>\n<h3>What happens to your body when you drink tea every day?<\/h3>\n<p>Numerous studies have shown that a variety of teas may boost your immune system, fight off inflammation, and even ward off cancer and heart disease. While some brews provide more health advantages than others, there\u2019s plenty of evidence that regularly drinking tea can have a lasting impact on your wellness.<\/p>\n<p>What is the healthiest tea to drink daily?<\/p>\n<p>Best for Overall Health: Green Tea<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to tea, green tea gets the gold. \u201cGreen tea is the champ when it comes to offering health benefits,\u201d says Czerwony. \u201cIt\u2019s the Swiss Army knife of teas.<\/p>\n<p>Why does tea make you pee more than water?<\/p>\n<p>A diuretic is a substance that can cause your body to produce more urine. Caffeine does this by increasing the blood flow to your kidneys, encouraging them to flush out more water ( 2 ). This diuretic effect can cause you to urinate more frequently, which may affect your hydration more than non-caffeinated beverages.<\/p>\n<p>Does tea make you poop?<\/p>\n<p>Stimulating teas and coffee also have a laxative effect. Black tea, green tea, and coffee naturally contain caffeine, a stimulant that speeds up bowel movements in many people. People often drink these beverages in the morning to wake themselves up and encourage a bowel movement.<\/p>\n<p>Is drinking unsweet tea the same as drinking water?<\/p>\n<p>In all essence, unsweetened tea does count as water. Tea, although mildly diuretic, help your body get hydrated, and your body absorbs the maximum water from the beverage. According to studies, drinking four to six mugs of tea a day is as good for keeping you hydrated as a litre of water.<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Team leader, Dr Carrie Ruxton, a Public Health Nutritionist, said tea is better for you than water because all water does is rehydrate you.
