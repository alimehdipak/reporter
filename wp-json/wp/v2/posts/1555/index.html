I just don&#8217;t like that, but that&#8217;s how Bruce is. He comes in and keeps the same energy throughout the whole season so &#8212; but we don&#8217;t need to say s&#8212; like that. Let&#8217;s just go out there and hoop.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Brown&#8217;s comments came after he was asked what he felt the biggest key will be to slowing down the Celtics in the series, which starts in Boston on Sunday afternoon.<\/p>\n<p>2 Related<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t let [Jayson] Tatum get 50,&#8221; Brown said. &#8220;We got to be physical with them. Now they don&#8217;t have Robert Williams, so they have less of a presence in the paint, and we could attack Al Horford and [Daniel] Theis. So them not having Robert Williams is huge.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Durant, who took the dais for the postgame news conference after Brown did, had already been tipped off that Brown had said something he wouldn&#8217;t appreciate.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;What did Bruce Brown say when he got up here?&#8221; Durant asked the assembled media. &#8220;He said something I didn&#8217;t like, somebody just told me.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>When told of Brown&#8217;s comments, Durant tried to walk them back.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s caffeine pride talking,&#8221; Durant said. &#8220;He takes something before the game. Those two dudes [Horford and Theis] can do the same stuff. It ain&#8217;t going to be that easy, I tell you that.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Aside from keeping Brown&#8217;s words in check, Durant knows the bigger key in the series will be defending Tatum. The Celtics All-Star went off for 50 points in a win over the Nets in early March and continued to improve his game while leading the Celtics to the No. 2 seed in the East.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It starts with really slowing JT down,&#8221; Nets guard Kyrie Irving said. &#8220;He has a great feel playing against us, and everyone else around is very complementary to that attack; and when JT&#8217;s getting doubled, Marcus Smart is pushing the pace, he&#8217;s playing well hitting shots. Al Horford&#8217;s dominating the offensive rebounds, and Daniel Theis filling in for Robert Williams, it&#8217;s big.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>How do the Nets plan to slow down Tatum? Durant knows that&#8217;s easier said than done.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a tough question,&#8221; Durant said. &#8220;He&#8217;s one of those players you just got to play hard and see what happens. He&#8217;s just so talented and skilled and efficient at what he does. We gotta just play hard &#8212; and I expect us to.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>NEW YORK &#8212; Brooklyn Nets star forward Kevin Durant has been in the league long enough to know it&#8217;s not wise to give a playoff opponent any extra motivation before a series begins.So when Durant heard Nets guard Bruce Brown&#8217;s critique of the Boston Celtics, saying that the Nets can attack them down low in&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":1556,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[13],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1555"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1555"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1555\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1555"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1555"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/m\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1555"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
