Mode S equipment has altitude capability and also permits data exchange.<\/p>\n<h3>When must you have a Mode C transponder?<\/h3>\n<p>However, if you wish to operate in class A, B, or C airspace, or at an altitude of over 10,000\u2032 MSL, or within a 30 nautical mile radius of the primary airport in class B airspace, you will need a transponder and altitude encoder (commonly referred to as \u201cmode C\u201d).<\/p>\n<p>What is Mode C in aviation?<\/p>\n<p>While the primary function of secondary surveillance radar (SSR) is to detect and identify aircraft, the radar response from the aircraft may also be encoded to indicate the aircraft altitude. This capability is known as Mode C and will indicate the aircraft pressure altitude at intervals of the closest 100ft.<\/p>\n<p>Does ADS-B Replace Mode C transponder?<\/p>\n<p>The short answer is no. Your transponder and Mode C equipment remains and ADS-B is added. ADS-B will become primary ATC and transponder secondary. Assuming you are referring to a Part 23 aircraft, you have the option of equipping for ADS-B with 1090ES transponder upgrades, or with a UAT transmitter.<\/p>\n<p>Is Mode C required for IFR?<\/p>\n<p>Mode C is also required within the Mode C veil of Class B airspace and at and above 10,000 MSL, unless you\u2019re within 2,500 AGL. I have position, but not altitude. Can I file and fly an IFR X\/C? Yes, assuming you\u2019re not in any of the airspace described above.<\/p>\n<h3>What is Class C airspace?<\/h3>\n<p>Class C airspace is generally airspace from the surface to 4,000 feet above the airport elevation (charted in MSL) surrounding those airports that have an operational control tower, are serviced by a radar approach control, and have a certain number of IFR operations or passenger enplanements.<\/p>\n<p>Is it legal to fly without a transponder?<\/p>\n<p>3 Answers. Show activity on this post. Yes, you can in the US in Class D, E &amp; G airspace according to 14 CFR 91.215. You will need to placard the transponder INOP, and make a note in the aircraft logbook.<\/p>\n<p>Can you fly over Class C airspace without a transponder?<\/p>\n<p>Radio Procedures And Required Equipment<\/p>\n<p>While you don\u2019t need an operable transponder to fly below a Class C shelf, you will need one to fly above Class C airspace. As you approach a Class C airport, you\u2019ll contact that airspace\u2019s approach control.<\/p>\n<p>What does squawk 7777 mean?<\/p>\n<p>Some squawk codes are reserved, such as 7700 (emergency), 7600 (communication failure), 7500 (hijacking), 1202 (glider), 1200 (VFR), etc. One of these, 7777, is apparently used for \u201cmilitary interception.\u201d What does this mean in the United States?<\/p>\n<h3>Where is Mode S transponder required?<\/h3>\n<p>Thus, we conclude that Mode S transponders are necessary for part 135 and part 121 operators (those not required to have TCAS II) and provide benefits beyond those considered in 1996. Mode S avionics now are available for all types of aircraft from general aviation to heavy commercial aircraft.<\/p>\n<p>What is SSR transponder?<\/p>\n<p>SSR is based on the military identification friend or foe (IFF) technology originally developed during World War II. The transponder is a radio receiver and transmitter which receives on one frequency (1090 MHz) and transmits on another (1030 MHz).<\/p>\n<p>Is Mode S ADS-B?<\/p>\n<p>Mode-S employs airborne transponders to provide altitude and identification data, with Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) adding global navigation data typically obtained from a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver.<\/p>\n<p>What is the difference between Mode C transponder and ADS-B out?<\/p>\n<p>Mode C = Altitude encoded in reply. Mode ES \/ ADS-B = location information encoded so radar no longer required to locate target.<\/p>\n<p>Do you need a transponder if you have ADS-B?<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also need it within the 30nm \u201cMode C Veil\u201d around Class B airports. So in general you\u2019ll need ADS-B Out most of the places you need a Mode C transponder today \u2013 and you\u2019ll need to keep that Mode C transponder if you install 978, because radar will be the backup for ADS-B.<\/p>\n<h3>Do all aircraft have to have ADS-B?<\/h3>\n<p>Final ADS-B Out rules were finalized in 2011. Those rules say that by 2020, all aircraft will be required to have ADS-B Out equipment to fly in Class A, B and C airspace, plus Class E airspace above 10,000 feet but not below 2,500 feet. You\u2019ll also need it within the 30nm \u201cMode C Veil\u201d around Class B airports.<\/p>\n<p>Can pilots turn off transponder?<\/p>\n<p>There are two knobs in the cockpit \u2014 one on the right, the other on the left \u2014 that control one or the other. When one transponder is on, the other is normally in standby mode. To turn off a transponder, a pilot turns a knob with multiple positions and selects the \u201coff\u201d setting.<\/p>\n<p>Can you fly under Class C airspace without ADS-B?<\/p>\n<p>Pilots: Do you need ADS-B when flying under a Class B or Class C airspace shelf? If there is no Mode C Veil, ADS-B is not required to fly under a shelf of Class B or C airspace. If there is a Mode C Veil, ADS-B is required to fly under the shelf.<\/p>\n<p>Can you overfly Class C airspace?<\/p>\n<p>Overflying Class C is something else againthe purpose of Class C is to ensure that the controlling facility knows who is flying in their airspace and what their intentions are. IMHO it helps the controllers to know the intentions of a pilot who is just passing through.<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mode C equipment enables the ATCO to see the aircraft altitude or flight level automatically.
